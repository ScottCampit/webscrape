30980322,Isotopic Labeling and Quantitative Proteomics of Acetylation on Histones and Beyond.,"Lysine acetylation is an important posttranslational modification (PTM) that regulates the function of proteins by affecting their localization, stability, binding, and enzymatic activity. Aberrant acetylation patterns have been observed in numerous diseases, most notably cancer, which has spurred the development of potential therapeutics that target acetylation pathways. Mass spectrometry (MS) has become the most adopted tool not only for the qualitative identification of acetylation sites but also for their large-scale quantification. By using heavy isotope labeling in cell culture combined with MS, it is now possible to accurately quantify newly synthesized acetyl groups and other PTMs, allowing differentiation between dynamically regulated and steady-state modifications. Here, we describe MS-based protocols to identify acetylation sites and quantify acetylation rates on both proteins in general and in the special case of histones. In the experimental approach for the former, ",Methods Mol. Biol.,2019,"['Lund PJ', 'Kori Y', 'Zhao X', 'Sidoli S', 'Yuan ZF', 'Garcia BA']"
30872405,Regulation of proline-directed kinases and the trans-histone code H3K9me3/H4K20me3 during human myogenesis.,"We present a system-level analysis of proteome, phosphoproteome, and chromatin state of precursors of muscle cells (myoblasts) differentiating into specialized myotubes. Using stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture and nano-liqud chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry, we found that phosphorylation motifs targeted by the kinases protein kinase C, cyclin-dependent kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase showed increased phosphorylation during myodifferentiation of LHCN-M2 human skeletal myoblast cell line. Drugs known to inhibit these kinases either promoted (PD0325901 and GW8510) or stalled (CHIR99021 and roscovitine) differentiation, resulting in myotube and myoblast phenotypes, respectively. The proteomes, especially the myogenic and chromatin-related proteins including histone methyltransferases, correlated with their phenotypes, leading us to quantify histone post-translational modifications and identify two gene-silencing marks, H3K9me3 and H4K20me3, with relative abundances changing in correlation with these phenotypes. ChIP-quantitative PCR demonstrated that H3K9me3 is erased from the gene loci of myogenic regulatory factors namely ",J. Biol.

30725455,Integrated Analysis of Acetyl-CoA and Histone Modification via Mass Spectrometry to Investigate Metabolically Driven Acetylation.,"Acetylation is a highly abundant and dynamic post-translational modification (PTM) on histone proteins which, when present on chromatin-bound histones, facilitates the accessibility of DNA for gene transcription. The central metabolite, acetyl-CoA, is a substrate for acetyltransferases, which catalyze protein acetylation. Acetyl-CoA is an essential intermediate in diverse metabolic pathways, and cellular acetyl-CoA levels fluctuate according to extracellular nutrient availability and the metabolic state of the cell. The Michaelis constant (Km) of most histone acetyltransferases (HATs), which specifically target histone proteins, falls within the range of cellular acetyl-CoA concentrations. As a consequence, global levels of histone acetylation are often restricted by availability of acetyl-CoA. Such metabolic regulation of histone acetylation is important for cell proliferation, differentiation, and a variety of cellular functions. In cancer, numerous oncogenic signaling events hijack cellular metabolism, ultimately inducing an extensive rearrangement of the epigenetic state of the cell. Understanding metabolic control of the epigenome through histone acetylation is essential to illuminate the molecular mechanisms by which cells sense, adapt, and occasionally disengage nutrient fluctuations and environmental cues from gene expression. In particular, targeting metabolic regulators or even dietary interventions to impact acetyl-CoA availability and histone acetylation is a promising target in cancer therapy. Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is the most accurate methodology to quantify protein PTMs and metabolites. In this chapter, we present state-of-the-art protocols to analyze histone acetylation and acetyl-CoA. Histones are extracted and digested into short peptides (4-20 aa) prior to LC-MS. Acetyl-CoA is extracted from cells and analyzed using an analogous mass spectrometry-based procedure. Model systems can be fed with isotopically labeled substrates to investigate the metabolic preference for acetyl-CoA production and the metabolic dependence and turnover of histone acetylation. We also present an example of data integration to correlate changes in acetyl-CoA production with histone acetylation.",Methods Mol. Biol.,2019,"['Sidoli S', 'Trefely S', 'Garcia BA', 'Carrer A']"
30073522,Detection of Histone Modification Dynamics during the Cell Cycle by MS-Based Proteomics.,"DNA replication and subsequent deposition of nucleosomes is critical for the maintenance of the genome and epigenetic inheritance. Experiments using human tissue culture cells harvested at defined stages of the cell cycle can help to elucidate the mechanism of histone deposition and chromatin assembly in detail. Here, we describe a pulsed-SILAC approach to distinguish newly synthesized and deposited histones during S-phase of the cell cycle from parental ""old"" histones incorporated in previous replications and to decipher posttranslational histone modifications (PTMs).",Methods Mol.

28137569,A Super-SILAC Strategy for the Accurate and Multiplexed Profiling of Histone Posttranslational Modifications.,"Histone posttranslational modifications (hPTMs) generate a complex combinatorial code that plays a critical role in the regulation of gene activity and nuclear architecture during physiological and pathological processes. Mass spectrometry (MS) offers an unbiased, comprehensive, and quantitative view on hPTM patterns, and has emerged as a powerful tool in epigenetic research. Stable isotope labeling by amino acid in cell culture (SILAC) is a MS-based quantitative method that relies on the metabolic labeling of cell populations, which has been widely applied in global proteomic studies and can also be exploited for the accurate quantitation of hPTM changes among distinct functional states. However, the classical SILAC strategy has two main limits: it cannot be applied to more than three cell populations at the time and excludes samples that cannot be metabolically labeled, such as clinical samples. These limitations can be overcome by using a super-SILAC strategy, where a mix of heavy-labeled cell lines is used as a spike-in to analyze any types of samples with high accuracy and high multiplexing capabilities. In this chapter, we will provide a detailed description of a protocol to set up a histone-focused super-SILAC strategy and exploit it to accurately profile hPTMs across multiple samples. As a case study, we will describe a breast cancer-focused super-SILAC approach, which we used in a recent publication to profile hPTMs in frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human samples, revealing previously unknown marks that differentiate breast cancer subtypes.",Meth.

27423860,Investigating Histone Acetylation Stoichiometry and Turnover Rate.,"Histone acetylation is a dynamic epigenetic modification that functions in the regulation of DNA-templated reactions, such as transcription. This lysine modification is reversibly controlled by histone (lysine) acetyltransferases and deacetylases. Here, we present methods employing isotopic labeling and mass spectrometry (MS) to comprehensively investigate histone acetylation dynamics. Turnover rates of histone acetylation are determined by measuring the kinetics of labeling from (13)C-labeled precursors of acetyl-CoA, which incorporates (13)C-carbon onto histones via the acetyltransferase reaction. Overall histone acetylation states are assessed from complete protease digestion to single amino acids, which is followed by MS analysis. Determination of site-specific acetylation stoichiometry is achieved by chemically acetylating endogenous histones with isotopic acetic anhydride, followed by trypsin digestion and LC-MS analysis. Combining metabolic labeling with stoichiometric analysis permits determination of both acetylation level and acetylation dynamics. When comparing genetic, diet, or environmental perturbations, these methods permit both a global and site-specific evaluation of how histone acetylation is dynamically regulated.",Meth.

27302567,FASIL-MS: An Integrated Proteomic and Bioinformatic Workflow To Universally Quantitate In Vivo-Acetylated Positional Isomers.,"Dynamic changes in histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) regulate gene transcription leading to fine-tuning of biological processes such as DNA replication and cell cycle progression. Moreover, specific histone modifications constitute docking sites for recruitment of DNA damage repair proteins and mediation of subsequent cell survival. Therefore, understanding and monitoring changes in histone PTMs that can alter cell proliferation and thus lead to disease progression are of considerable medical interest. In this study, stable isotope labeling with N-acetoxy-D3-succinimide (D3-NAS) was utilized to efficiently derivatize unmodified lysine residues at the protein level. The sample preparation method was streamlined to facilitate buffer exchange between the multiple steps of the protocol by coupling chemical derivatization to filter-aided sample preparation (FASP). Additionally, the mass spectrometry method was adapted to simultaneously coisolate and subsequently cofragment all differentially H3/D3-acetylated histone peptide clusters. Combination of these multiplexed MS(2) spectra with the implementation of a data analysis algorithm enabled the quantitation of each and every in vivo-acetylated DMSO- and SAHA-treated H4(4-17) and H3(18-26) peptide. We have termed our new approach FASIL-MS for filter-aided stable isotopic labeling coupled to mass spectrometry. FASIL-MS enables the universal and site-specific quantitation of peptides with multiple in vivo-acetylated lysine residues. Data are available via ProteomeXchange (PXD003611).",J.

27226594,Preferential Phosphorylation on Old Histones during Early Mitosis in Human Cells.,"How histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) are inherited through the cell cycle remains poorly understood. Canonical histones are made in the S phase of the cell cycle. Combining mass spectrometry-based technologies and stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture, we question the distribution of multiple histone PTMs on old versus new histones in synchronized human cells. We show that histone PTMs can be grouped into three categories according to their distributions. Most lysine mono-methylation and acetylation PTMs are either symmetrically distributed on old and new histones or are enriched on new histones. In contrast, most di- and tri-methylation PTMs are enriched on old histones, suggesting that the inheritance of different PTMs is regulated distinctly. Intriguingly, old and new histones are distinct in their phosphorylation status during early mitosis in the following three human cell types: HeLa, 293T, and human foreskin fibroblast cells. The mitotic hallmark H3S10ph is predominantly associated with old H3 at early mitosis and becomes symmetric with the progression of mitosis. This same distribution was observed with other mitotic phosphorylation marks, including H3T3/T6ph, H3.1/2S28ph, and H1.4S26ph but not S28/S31ph on the H3 variant H3.3. Although H3S10ph often associates with the neighboring Lys-9 di- or tri-methylations, they are not required for the asymmetric distribution of Ser-10 phosphorylation on the same H3 tail. Inhibition of the kinase Aurora B does not change the distribution despite significant reduction of H3S10ph levels. However, K9me2 abundance on the new H3 is significantly reduced after Aurora B inhibition, suggesting a cross-talk between H3S10ph and H3K9me2.",J. Biol.

26675280,Treating Colon Cancer Cells with FK228 Reveals a Link between Histone Lysine Acetylation and Extensive Changes in the Cellular Proteome.,"The therapeutic value of FK228 as a cancer treatment option is well known, and various types of cancer have been shown to respond to this drug. However, the complete mechanism of FK228 and the affect it has on histone lysine acetylation and the colon cancer cell proteome are largely unknown. In the present study, we used stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and affinity enrichment followed by high-resolution liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer (LC-MS)/MS analysis to quantitate the changes in the lysine acetylome in HCT-8 cells after FK228 treatment. A total of 1,194 lysine acetylation sites in 751 proteins were quantified, with 115 of the sites in 85 proteins being significantly upregulated and 38 of the sites in 32 proteins being significantly downregulated in response to FK228 treatment. Interestingly, 47 histone lysine acetylation sites were identified in the core histone proteins. We also found a novel lysine acetylation site on H2BK121. These significantly altered proteins are involved in multiple biological functions as well as a myriad of metabolic and enzyme-regulated pathways. Taken together, the link between FK228 function and the downstream changes in the HCT-8 cell proteome observed in response to FK228 treatment is established.

25792596,Two distinct modes for propagation of histone PTMs across the cell cycle.,"Epigenetic states defined by chromatin can be maintained through mitotic cell division. However, it remains unknown how histone-based information is transmitted. Here we combine nascent chromatin capture (NCC) and triple-SILAC (stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture) labeling to track histone modifications and histone variants during DNA replication and across the cell cycle. We show that post-translational modifications (PTMs) are transmitted with parental histones to newly replicated DNA. Di- and trimethylation marks are diluted twofold upon DNA replication, as a consequence of new histone deposition. Importantly, within one cell cycle, all PTMs are restored. In general, new histones are modified to mirror the parental histones. However, H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and H3K27me3 are propagated by continuous modification of parental and new histones because the establishment of these marks extends over several cell generations. Together, our results reveal how histone marks propagate and demonstrate that chromatin states oscillate within the cell cycle.

25369635,Identification of 'erasers' for lysine crotonylated histone marks using a chemical proteomics approach.,"Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) play a crucial role in a wide range of biological processes. Lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is a newly discovered histone PTM that is enriched at active gene promoters and potential enhancers in mammalian cell genomes. However, the cellular enzymes that regulate the addition and removal of Kcr are unknown, which has hindered further investigation of its cellular functions. Here we used a chemical proteomics approach to comprehensively profile 'eraser' enzymes that recognize a lysine-4 crotonylated histone H3 (H3K4Cr) mark. We found that Sirt1, Sirt2, and Sirt3 can catalyze the hydrolysis of lysine crotonylated histone peptides and proteins. More importantly, Sirt3 functions as a decrotonylase to regulate histone Kcr dynamics and gene transcription in living cells. This discovery not only opens opportunities for examining the physiological significance of histone Kcr, but also helps to unravel the unknown cellular mechanisms controlled by Sirt3, that have previously been considered solely as a deacetylase.

25234497,Comparative analysis of histone H3 and H4 post-translational modifications of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with different invasive capabilities.,"UNLABELLED: Eukaryotic DNA is packaged into a chromatin with the help of four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). Diverse histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) are hence involved in the regulation of gene transcription. However, how this regulation does work is still poorly understood and lacks details. Here we used the mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach to perform a comparative analysis of histone marks at a global level in two phenotypes of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) with different invasiveness. We obtained a comprehensive profiling of histone H3 and H4 PTMs including lysine methylation, acetylation and novel butyrylation. The correlation between histone marks and cancer invasive capabilities was further characterized and one distinguishable PTM, H4K79me2 was discovered and verified in this study. Immunohistochemistry analysis suggests that abnormal level of H4K79me2 may be related to poor survival of ESCC patients. Our results enrich the dataset of the feature pattern of global histone PTMs in ESCC cell lines.
BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Core histone proteins, decorated by multiple biological significant protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as lysine acetylation and lysine methylation, are considered to regulate gene transcription and be associated with the development of cancer. Recent studies have further shown that global level of histone modifications is the potential hallmark of cancer to predict the clinical outcomes of human cancers. However, the regulation mechanism is largely unknown. Here we used the mass spectrometry based proteomics coupled with stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) to characterize the global levels of histone marks in two phenotypes of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cell lines with different invasive capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first report about the comparative analysis for histone marks of the different invasive ESCC cell lines. A significantly differential level of histone modification, H4K79me2, was determined and verified. Immunohistochemistry analysis further suggests that abnormal level of H4K79me2 may be related to poor survival of ESCC patients. Our results could contribute to understanding the different expressions of global histone PTMs in different invasive ESCC cell lines.",J Proteomics,2015,"['Zhang K', 'Li L', 'Zhu M', 'Wang G', 'Xie J', 'Zhao Y', 'Fan E', 'Xu L', 'Li E']"
23909948,SAHA treatment reveals the link between histone lysine acetylation and proteome in nonsmall cell lung cancer A549 Cells.,"Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) is a well-known pan HDAC inhibitor, and its clinical application (Vorinostat) has been demonstrated to treat nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLS). Nevertheless, the impact of SAHA treatment on histone lysine acetylation and proteome in NSCLS cells still need further elucidate. In NSCLS A549 cells, by using stable isotope labeling for cell culture (SILAC)-based quantitative proteomics, biochemistry assay, and bioinformatic analysis, here we for the first time comprehensively identified and quantified histone lysine acetylation in A549 cells toward SAHA treatment. Despite the fact that SAHA treatment significantly increased histone lysine acetylation in specific sites, unexpectedly, some important ""histone markers"" showed markedly decreased acetylation level. Further quantitative proteome studies showed that among totally quantifiable 2818 nonredundant proteins, 1355 proteins were with increased level and 1463 with decreased level in response to SAHA treatment. Bioinformatic analysis further revealed that those quantifiable proteins were mainly involved in multiple biological functions and metabolic and enzyme-regulated pathways as well as protein complexes. By establishing the link between histone modification and whole proteome in response to SAHA treatment in NSCLS cells, this study therefore may deepen our understanding of HDAC inhibitor-mediated cancer therapeutics.

23892279,Measurement of acetylation turnover at distinct lysines in human histones identifies long-lived acetylation sites.,"Histone acetylation has long been determined as a highly dynamic modification associated with open chromatin and transcriptional activation. Here we develop a metabolic labelling scheme using stable isotopes to study the kinetics of acetylation turnover at 19 distinct lysines on histones H3, H4 and H2A. Using human HeLa S3 cells, the analysis reveals 12 sites of histone acetylation with fast turnover and 7 sites stable over a 30 h experiment. The sites showing fast turnover (anticipated from classical radioactive measurements of whole histones) have half-lives between ~1-2 h. To support this finding, we use a broad-spectrum deacetylase inhibitor to verify that only fast turnover sites display 2-10-fold increases in acetylation whereas long-lived sites clearly do not. Most of these stable sites lack extensive functional studies or localization within global chromatin, and their role in non-genetic mechanisms of inheritance is as yet unknown.",Nat Commun,2013,"['Zheng Y', 'Thomas PM', 'Kelleher NL']"
23468656,Quantitative analysis of histone modifications: formaldehyde is a source of pathological n(6)-formyllysine that is refractory to histone deacetylases.,"Aberrant protein modifications play an important role in the pathophysiology of many human diseases, in terms of both dysfunction of physiological modifications and the formation of pathological modifications by reaction of proteins with endogenous electrophiles. Recent studies have identified a chemical homolog of lysine acetylation, N(6)-formyllysine, as an abundant modification of histone and chromatin proteins, one possible source of which is the reaction of lysine with 3'-formylphosphate residues from DNA oxidation. Using a new liquid chromatography-coupled to tandem mass spectrometry method to quantify all N(6)-methyl-, -acetyl- and -formyl-lysine modifications, we now report that endogenous formaldehyde is a major source of N(6)-formyllysine and that this adduct is widespread among cellular proteins in all compartments. N(6)-formyllysine was evenly distributed among different classes of histone proteins from human TK6 cells at 1-4 modifications per 10(4) lysines, which contrasted strongly with lysine acetylation and mono-, di-, and tri-methylation levels of 1.5-380, 5-870, 0-1400, and 0-390 per 10(4) lysines, respectively. While isotope labeling studies revealed that lysine demethylation is not a source of N(6)-formyllysine in histones, formaldehyde exposure was observed to cause a dose-dependent increase in N(6)-formyllysine, with use of [(13)C,(2)H2]-formaldehyde revealing unchanged levels of adducts derived from endogenous sources. Inhibitors of class I and class II histone deacetylases did not affect the levels of N(6)-formyllysine in TK6 cells, and the class III histone deacetylase, SIRT1, had minimal activity (<10%) with a peptide substrate containing the formyl adduct. These data suggest that N(6)-formyllysine is refractory to removal by histone deacetylases, which supports the idea that this abundant protein modification could interfere with normal regulation of gene expression if it arises at conserved sites of physiological protein secondary modification.",PLoS Genet.,2013,"['Edrissi B', 'Taghizadeh K', 'Dedon PC']"

However, partly limited to the research technologies previously available, the dynamics of global histone methylation on a site-specific basis have not been fully pursued. Heavy methyl-SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling of Amino Acids in Cell Culture) labeling provides a remarkable signpost to distinguish the preexisting and newly generated methyl marks on histones. Using this technology coupled with quantitative LC-MS analysis make it possible to monitor changes in the dynamics of histone site-specific methylation.

RESULTS: In this work, the combinatorial method of chromatographic separation, methylation isotope labeling and LTQ-Orbitrap(Â®) MS was employed to quantify the acetylation sites of histone H3 separately within normal liver cells L02 and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells HepG2, HCC metastasis cells 97H and HCC cells HepG2, high HCC metastasis potential cells LM3 and low HCC metastasis potential cells 97L. In comparison with the quantitative results of HepG2 and L02, the amounts of five acetylated and methylated peptides were found decreased. Similarly, when comparing the 97H with HepG2, the amounts of eight acetylated and methylated peptides were found decreased, and when comparing the LM3 with 97L, the amounts of six acetylated and methylated peptides were found decreased.

23319141,The proteomic investigation of chromatin functional domains reveals novel synergisms among distinct heterochromatin components.,"Chromatin is a highly dynamic, well-structured nucleoprotein complex of DNA and proteins that controls virtually all DNA transactions. Chromatin dynamicity is regulated at specific loci by the presence of various associated proteins, histones, post-translational modifications, histone variants, and DNA methylation. Until now the characterization of the proteomic component of chromatin domains has been held back by the challenge of enriching distinguishable, homogeneous regions for subsequent mass spectrometry analysis. Here we describe a modified protocol for chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with quantitative proteomics based on stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture to identify known and novel histone modifications, variants, and complexes that specifically associate with silent and active chromatin domains. Our chromatin proteomics strategy revealed unique functional interactions among various chromatin modifiers, suggesting new regulatory pathways, such as a heterochromatin-specific modulation of DNA damage response involving H2A.X and WICH, both enriched in silent domains.

23281010,Examining post-translational modification-mediated protein-protein interactions using a chemical proteomics approach.,"Post-translational modifications (PTM) of proteins can control complex and dynamic cellular processes via regulating interactions between key proteins. To understand these regulatory mechanisms, it is critical that we can profile the PTM-dependent protein-protein interactions. However, identifying these interactions can be very difficult using available approaches, as PTMs can be dynamic and often mediate relatively weak protein-protein interactions. We have recently developed CLASPI (cross-linking-assisted and stable isotope labeling in cell culture-based protein identification), a chemical proteomics approach to examine protein-protein interactions mediated by methylation in human cell lysates. Here, we report three extensions of the CLASPI approach. First, we show that CLASPI can be used to analyze methylation-dependent protein-protein interactions in lysates of fission yeast, a genetically tractable model organism. For these studies, we examined trimethylated histone H3 lysine-9 (H3K9Meâ)-dependent protein-protein interactions. Second, we demonstrate that CLASPI can be used to examine phosphorylation-dependent protein-protein interactions. In particular, we profile proteins recognizing phosphorylated histone H3 threonine-3 (H3T3-Phos), a mitotic histone ""mark"" appearing exclusively during cell division. Our approach identified survivin, the only known H3T3-Phos-binding protein, as well as other proteins, such as MCAK and KIF2A, that are likely to be involved in weak but selective interactions with this histone phosphorylation ""mark"". Finally, we demonstrate that the CLASPI approach can be used to study the interplay between histone H3T3-Phos and trimethylation on the adjacent residue lysine 4 (H3K4Meâ).

A large class of proteins were specifically repelled by H3K4me3. Our screen reached near-saturation of direct interactors, most of which are ubiquitously expressed.

22910201,Investigating the cell cycle-associated dynamics of histone modifications using quantitative mass spectrometry.,"In eukaryotic cells, posttranslational modifications (PTMs) on histones regulate chromatin structure and thus impact nearly all chromatin-templated events, including replication, transcription, and DNA repair. During S phase, newly synthesized histones are deposited onto DNA, leading to dilution of total chromatin-associated modifications. To maintain genome organization in daughter cells, histone PTMs must be reestablished in the subsequent cell cycle. Owing to their importance for determining cellular fate, the mechanisms that underlie the inheritance of epigenetic mark from parent cells by daughter cells are of great interest. In recent years, mass spectrometry (MS) has emerged as a powerful tool for identifying and quantifying histone modifications. This chapter describes strategies for investigating the reestablishment of histone PTMs during the mitotic cell cycle using quantitative MS approaches.

Mass spectrometry (MS) has been a powerful tool to study histone variants and PTMs, as it not only can identify novel PTMs but also can provide quantitative measurement of a spectrum of histone variants and PTMs in the same sample. In this chapter, we employ a combination of chemical derivation and high-resolution MS to identify and quantify multiple histone variants and PTMs. Histones are acid extracted and modified with propionyl groups and subsequently produces suitable sizes of fragments for MS analysis by trypsin digestion.

While significant progress has been made to detect PTMs, profiling protein-protein interactions mediated by these PTMs remains a challenge. Here, we report a method that combines a photo-cross-linking strategy with stable isotope labeling in cell culture (SILAC)-based quantitative mass spectrometry to identify PTM-dependent protein-protein interactions.

Our approach identified proteins previously known to recognize this modification and MORC3 as a new protein that binds H3M4Me(3).

These PTMs are considered to be 'epigenetic' or heritable from one cell generation to the next and help establish genomic expression patterns. While much of the analyses of histones have historically been performed using site-specific antibodies, these methods are replete with technical obstacles (i.e., cross-reactivity and epitope occlusion). Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has begun to play a significant role in the interrogation of histone PTMs, revealing many new aspects of these modifications that cannot be easily determined with standard biological approaches. Here, we review the accomplishments of mass spectrometry in the histone field, and outline the future roadblocks that must be overcome for mass spectrometry-based proteomics to become the method of choice for chromatin biologists.",Expert Rev Proteomics,2011,"['Britton LM', 'Gonzales-Cope M', 'Zee BM', 'Garcia BA']"
21836164,Chromatin affinity purification and quantitative mass spectrometry defining the interactome of histone modification patterns.,"DNA and histone modifications direct the functional state of chromatin and thereby the readout of the genome. Candidate approaches and histone peptide affinity purification experiments have identified several proteins that bind to chromatin marks. However, the complement of factors that is recruited by individual and combinations of DNA and histone modifications has not yet been defined. Here, we present a strategy based on recombinant, uniformly modified chromatin templates used in affinity purification experiments in conjunction with SILAC-based quantitative mass spectrometry for this purpose. On the prototypic H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 histone modification marks we compare our method with a histone N-terminal peptide affinity purification approach. Our analysis shows that only some factors associate with both, chromatin and peptide matrices but that a surprisingly large number of proteins differ in their association with these templates. Global analysis of the proteins identified implies specific domains mediating recruitment to the chromatin marks. Our proof-of-principle studies show that chromatin templates with defined modification patterns can be used to decipher how the histone code is read and translated.",Mol.

20617350,"SILAC-based proteomic analysis to dissect the ""histone modification signature"" of human breast cancer cells.","In living cells, the N-terminal tails of core histones, the proteinaceous component of nucleosomes, are subjected to a range of covalent post-translational modifications (PTMs), which have specific roles in modulating chromatin structure and function. A growing body of evidence suggests that deregulation of histone modification patterns, upstream or downstream of DNA methylation, is a critical event in cancer initiation and progression. However, a comprehensive description of how histone modifications, singly or in combination, is disrupted in transformed cells is missing; consequently the issue whether and how specific changes in histone PTMs patterns correlate to particular tumor features is still elusive. In the present study, we focused on human breast cancer and comprehensively analyzed PTMs on histone H3 and H4 from four cancer cell lines (MCF7, MDA-MB231, MDA-MB453 and T-47D), in comparison with normal epithelial breast cells. We performed high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis of histones, in combination with stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), to quantitatively track the modification changes in cancer cells, as compared to their normal counterpart. Our investigation focuses on lysine acetylation and methylation on fourteen distinct sites in H3 and H4. We observed significant changes for several modifications in cancer cells: while in a few cases those modifications had been previously described as a hallmark of human tumors, we could identify novel modifications, whose abundance is significantly altered in breast cancer cells. Overall, these modifications may represent part of a ""breast cancer-specific epigenetic signature"", with implications in the characterization of histone-related biomarkers. This work demonstrates that SILAC-based proteomics is a powerful tool to study qualitatively and quantitatively histone PTMs patterns, contributing significantly to the comprehension of epigenetic phenomena in cancer biology.",Amino Acids,2011,"['Cuomo A', 'Moretti S', 'Minucci S', 'Bonaldi T']"
19877717,MS/MS/MS reveals false positive identification of histone serine methylation.,"Methylation of lysine and arginine residues is known to play a key role in regulating histone structure and function. However, methylation of other amino acid residues in histones has not been previously described. Using exhaustive nano-HPLC/MS/MS and blind protein sequence database searches, we tentatively assigned methylation to serine 28 of histone H3 from calf thymus. The assignment was in agreement with our stringent manual verification rules, coelution in HPLC/MS/MS with its corresponding synthetic peptide, the dynamic nature of such methylation in distinct cell lines, and isotopic labeling. However, careful inspection of the MS/MS and MS/MS/MS spectra of a series of synthetic peptides confirmed that methylation actually occurs on K27 rather than on S28. The misassignment was caused by the fact that the (y(9) + 14) of the putative S28-methylated peptide and (b(9) + 18) ions of the K27 methylated peptide share the same m/z value (m/z 801). This MS/MS peak was used as the major evidence to assign methylation to S28 (consecutive y(8) and (y(9) + 14) ions). MS/MS/MS analysis revealed the false positive nature of serine methylation: the ambiguous ion at m/z 801 is indeed (b(9) + 18), an ion resulting from an in vitro reaction in the gas phase during collisionally activated dissociation (CAD). When lysine (K27) was acetylated, the degree of such in vitro reactions was greatly reduced, and such reactions were completely eliminated when the C-terminus was blocked by carboxylic group derivatization. Moreover, such side-chain assisted C-terminal rearrangement was found to be charge dependent. In aggregate, these results suggest that extra caution should be taken in interpretation of post-translational modification (PTM) data and that MS/MS as well as MS/MS/MS of synthetic peptides are needed for verifying the identity of peptides bearing a novel PTM.",J.

17644761,Analysis of dynamic changes in post-translational modifications of human histones during cell cycle by mass spectrometry.,"The N-terminal tails of the four core histones are subject to several types of covalent post-translational modifications that have specific roles in regulating chromatin structure and function. Here we present an extensive analysis of the core histone modifications occurring through the cell cycle. Our MS experiments characterized the modification patterns of histones from HeLa cells arrested in phase G1, S, and G2/M. For all core histones, the modifications in the G1 and S phases were largely identical but drastically different during mitosis. Modification changes between S and G2/M phases were quantified using the SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture) approach. Most striking was the mitotic phosphorylation on histone H3 and H4, whereas phosphorylation on H2A was constant during the cell cycle. A loss of acetylation was observed on all histones in G2/M-arrested cells. The pattern of cycle-dependent methylation was more complex: during G2/M, H3 Lys27 and Lys36 were decreased, whereas H4 Lys20 was increased. Our results show that mitosis was the period of the cell cycle during which many modifications exhibit dynamic changes.",Mol.

17286952,Histone H4 acetylation dynamics determined by stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture and mass spectrometry.,"This paper describes an integrated approach that couples stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture to acetic acid-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (AU-PAGE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for the quantitation and dynamics of histone H4 acetylation. The 697 acute lymphoblastic cell lines were grown in regular medium and in medium in which lysine was substituted with deuterium-labeled lysine. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity was inhibited by addition of the HDAC inhibitor depsipeptide to the culture medium for different exposure times. Histones were extracted from cells pooled from unlabeled, untreated cells and from labeled, treated cells, followed by AU-PAGE separation. Gel bands corresponding to different acetylation states of H4 were excised, in-gel digested with trypsin, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. Detailed information was obtained for both the change of histone H4 acetylation specific to the N terminus and the global transformation of H4 from one acetylation state to another following treatment with the HDAC inhibitor depsipeptide. The kinetics of H4 acetylation was also assessed. This study provides a quantitative basis for developing potential therapies by using epigenetic regulation and the developed methodology can be applied to quantitation of change for other histone modifications induced by external stimuli.",Anal.

16335948,Resetting the epigenetic histone code in the MRL-lpr/lpr mouse model of lupus by histone deacetylase inhibition.,"The baseline level of gene expression varies between healthy controls and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, and among SLE patients themselves. These variations may explain the different clinical manifestations and severity of disease observed in SLE. Epigenetic mechanisms, which involve DNA and histone modifications, are predictably associated with distinct transcriptional states. To understand the interplay between various histone modifications, including acetylation and methylation, and lupus disease, we performed differential expression histone modification analysis in splenocytes from the MRL-lpr/lpr mouse model of lupus. Using stable isotope labeling in combination with mass spectrometry, we found global site-specific hypermethylation (except H3 K4 methylation) and hypoacetylation in histone H3 and H4 MRL-lpr/lpr mice compared to control MRL/MPJ mice. Moreover, we have identified novel histone modifications such as H3 K18 methylation, H4 K31 methylation, and H4 K31 acetylation that are differentially expressed in MRL-lpr/lpr mice compared to controls. Finally, in vivo administration of the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) corrected the site-specific hypoacetylation states on H3 and H4 in MRL-lpr/lpr mice with improvement of disease phenotype. Thus, this study is the first to establish the association between aberrant histone codes and pathogenesis of autoimmune disease SLE. These aberrant post-translational histone modifications can therefore be reset with histone deacetylase inhibition in vivo.",J.
