30499165,Long noncoding RNAs as regulators of cancer immunity.,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly known to be important in cancer as they directly interact with the cell cycle, proliferation pathways and microbiome balance. Moreover, lncRNAs regulate the immune system: they do not directly encode proteins of innate or adaptive immunity, but regulate immune cell differentiation and function, such as dendritic cell activity, T cell ratio and metabolism. The result of this complex interaction is that lncRNAs regulate cancer processes through a complex multimodal system involving immunity, metabolism and infection. The possible functions of lncRNAs and their roles in the regulation of cancer immunity will be reported and discussed in the present review. Recent studies showed their function as regulators in the tumour microenvironment (TME), epithelial-mesenchymal transition, microbiota, metabolism and immune cell differentiation. However, there is not much knowledge regarding their roles in cancer immunity regulation. Thus, the main aim of this review is to describe lncRNAs that have specifically been associated with immunity, the immune cycle and the TME.",Mol Oncol,2019,"['Denaro N', 'Merlano MC', 'Lo Nigro C']"
30483813,Biological role of metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells during epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (Review).,"Epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) is required for the distant metastasis of tumors. The degree of tumor malignancy increases as EMT progresses. Notably, the biology of tumor cells differs from that of normal cells, with regards to characteristics and energy metabolism mechanisms; abnormal glucose metabolism, excessive accumulation of fatty acids and other metabolic disorders occur in metastatic tumors. Previous studies have confirmed that the regulation of tumor cell metabolism can affect tumor metastasis and some findings have resulted in novel clinical applications. The present review aimed to provide a basis for treatments targeting the tumor EMT process and metabolic reprogramming.",Oncol.

30149660,"Ceramide Metabolism Balance, a Multifaceted Factor in Critical Steps of Breast Cancer Development.","Ceramides are key lipids in energetic-metabolic pathways and signaling cascades, modulating critical physiological functions in cells. While synthesis of ceramides is performed in endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is altered under overnutrition conditions, proteins associated with ceramide metabolism are located on membrane arrangement of mitochondria and ER (MAMs). However, ceramide accumulation in meta-inflammation, condition that associates obesity with a chronic low-grade inflammatory state, favors the deregulation of pathways such as insulin signaling, and induces structural rearrangements on mitochondrial membrane, modifying its permeability and altering the flux of ions and other molecules. Considering the wide biological processes in which sphingolipids are implicated, they have been associated with diseases that present abnormalities in their energetic metabolism, such as breast cancer. In this sense, sphingolipids could modulate various cell features, such as growth, proliferation, survival, senescence, and apoptosis in cancer progression; moreover, ceramide metabolism is associated to chemotherapy resistance, and regulation of metastasis. Cell⁻cell communication mediated by exosomes and lipoproteins has become relevant in the transport of several sphingolipids. Therefore, in this work we performed a comprehensive analysis of the state of the art about the multifaceted roles of ceramides, specifically the deregulation of ceramide metabolism pathways, being a key factor that could modulate neoplastic processes development. Under specific conditions, sphingolipids perform important functions in several cellular processes, and depending on the preponderant species and cellular and/or tissue status can inhibit or promote the development of metabolic and potentially breast cancer disease.",Int J Mol Sci,2018,"['García-González V', 'Díaz-Villanueva JF', 'Galindo-Hernández O', 'Martínez-Navarro I', 'Hurtado-Ureta G', 'Pérez-Arias AA']"
29855336,The role of HGF-MET pathway and CCDC66 cirRNA expression in EGFR resistance and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of lung adenocarcinoma cells.,"BACKGROUND: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has, in recent years, emerged as an important tumor cell behavior associated with high metastatic potential and drug resistance. Interestingly, protein SUMOylation and hepatocyte growth factor could respectively reduce the effect of small molecule inhibitors on tyrosine kinase activity of mutated epidermal growth factor receptor of lung adenocarcinomas (LADC). The actual mechanism is yet to be resolved.
METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to stain proteins in LADC specimens. Protein expression was confirmed by Western blotting. In vitro, expression of proteins was determined by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Levels of circular RNA were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: SAE2 and cirRNA CCDC66 were highly expressed in LADC. Expression of SAE2 was mainly regulated by EGFR; however, expression of cirRNA CCDC66 was positively regulated by FAK and c-Met but negatively modulated by nAchR7α. EGFR-resistant H1975 also highly expressed cirRNA CCDC66. Immediate response of hypoxia increased phosphorylated c-Met, SAE2, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Either activation of FAK or silencing of nAchR7α increased cirRNA CCDC66.
CONCLUSIONS: HGF/c-Met regulates expression of SAE2 and cirRNA CCDC66 to increase EMT and drug resistance of LADC cells. Multimodality drugs concurrently aiming at these targets would probably provide more benefits for cancer patients.",J Hematol Oncol,2018,"['Joseph NA', 'Chiou SH', 'Lung Z', 'Yang CL', 'Lin TY', 'Chang HW', 'Sun HS', 'Gupta SK', 'Yen L', 'Wang SD', 'Chow KC']"
29293497,Model-driven discovery of long-chain fatty acid metabolic reprogramming in heterogeneous prostate cancer cells.,"Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition promotes intra-tumoral heterogeneity, by enhancing tumor cell invasiveness and promoting drug resistance. We integrated transcriptomic data for two clonal subpopulations from a prostate cancer cell line (PC-3) into a genome-scale metabolic network model to explore their metabolic differences and potential vulnerabilities. In this dual cell model, PC-3/S cells express Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition markers and display high invasiveness and low metastatic potential, while PC-3/M cells present the opposite phenotype and higher proliferative rate. Model-driven analysis and experimental validations unveiled a marked metabolic reprogramming in long-chain fatty acids metabolism. While PC-3/M cells showed an enhanced entry of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria, PC-3/S cells used long-chain fatty acids as precursors of eicosanoid metabolism. We suggest that this metabolic reprogramming endows PC-3/M cells with augmented energy metabolism for fast proliferation and PC-3/S cells with increased eicosanoid production impacting angiogenesis, cell adhesion and invasion. PC-3/S metabolism also promotes the accumulation of docosahexaenoic acid, a long-chain fatty acid with antiproliferative effects. The potential therapeutic significance of our model was supported by a differential sensitivity of PC-3/M cells to etomoxir, an inhibitor of long-chain fatty acid transport to the mitochondria.",PLoS Comput.

28874504,Proteome Analysis of Hypoxic Glioblastoma Cells Reveals Sequential Metabolic Adaptation of One-Carbon Metabolic Pathways.,"Rapidly proliferating tumors are exposed to a hypoxic microenvironment because of their density, high metabolic consumption, and interruptions in blood flow because of immature angiogenesis. Cellular responses to hypoxia promote highly malignant and metastatic behavior, as well as a chemotherapy-resistant state. To better understand the complex relationships between hypoxic adaptations and cancer progression, we studied the dynamic proteome responses of glioblastoma cells exposed to hypoxia via an innovative approach: quantification of newly synthesized proteins using heavy stable-isotope arginine labeling combined with accurate assessment of cell replication by quantification of the light/heavy arginine ratio of peptides in histone H4. We found that hypoxia affects cancer cells in multiple intertwined ways: inflammation, typically with over-expressed glucose transporter (GLUT1), DUSP4/MKP2, and RelA proteins; a metabolic adaptation with overexpression of all glycolytic pathway enzymes for pyruvate/lactate synthesis; and the EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) and cancer stem cell (CSC) renewal with characteristic morphological changes and mesenchymal/CSC protein expression profiles. For the first time, we identified the vitamin B",Mol.

28798381,Transcriptional hallmarks of cancer cell lines reveal an emerging role of branched chain amino acid catabolism.,"A comparative analysis between cancer cell lines and healthy dividing cells was performed using data (289 microarrays and 50 RNA-seq samples) from 100 different cancer cell lines and 6 types of healthy stem cells. The analysis revealed two large-scale transcriptional events that characterize cancer cell lines. The first event was a large-scale up-regulation pattern associated to epithelial-mesenchymal transition, putatively driven by the interplay of the SP1 transcription factor and the canonical Wnt signaling pathway; the second event was the failure to overexpress a diverse set of genes coding membrane and extracellular proteins. This failure is putatively caused by a lack of activity of the AP-1 complex. It was also shown that the epithelial-mesenchymal transition was associated with the up-regulation of 5 enzymes involved in the degradation of branched chain amino acids. The suitability of silencing one of this enzymes (branched chain amino acid transaminase 2; BCAT2) with therapeutic effects was tested experimentally on the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and primary cell culture of breast tumor (BCC), leading to lower cell proliferation. The silencing of BCAT2 did not have any significant effect on ASM and MCF10A cells, which were used as models of healthy dividing cells.",Sci Rep,2017,"['Antanavičiūtė I', 'Mikalayeva V', 'Ceslevičienė I', 'Milašiūtė G', 'Skeberdis VA', 'Bordel S']"
28444969,Metabolic reprogramming and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in cancer.,"Several lines of evidence indicate that during transformation epithelial cancer cells can acquire mesenchymal features via a process called epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This process endows cancer cells with increased invasive and migratory capacity, enabling tumour dissemination and metastasis. EMT is associated with a complex metabolic reprogramming, orchestrated by EMT transcription factors, which support the energy requirements of increased motility and growth in harsh environmental conditions. The discovery that mutations in metabolic genes such as FH, SDH and IDH activate EMT provided further evidence that EMT and metabolism are intertwined. In this review, we discuss the role of EMT in cancer and the underpinning metabolic reprogramming. We also put forward the hypothesis that, by altering chromatin structure and function, metabolic pathways engaged by EMT are necessary for its full activation.",FEBS J.,2017,"['Sciacovelli M', 'Frezza C']"
27959387,Long-term exposure of MCF-7 breast cancer cells to ethanol stimulates oncogenic features.,"Alcohol consumption is a risk factor for breast cancer. Little is known regarding the mechanism, although it is assumed that acetaldehyde or estrogen mediated pathways play a role. We previously showed that long-term exposure to 2.5 mM ethanol (blood alcohol ~0.012%) of MCF-12A, a human normal epithelial breast cell line, induced epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and oncogenic transformation. In this study, we investigated in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, whether a similar exposure to ethanol at concentrations ranging up to peak blood levels in heavy drinkers would increase malignant progression. Short-term (1-week) incubation to ethanol at as low as 1-5 mM (corresponding to blood alcohol concentration of ~0.0048-0.024%) upregulated the stem cell related proteins Oct4 and Nanog, but they were reduced after exposure at 25 mM. Long-term (4-week) exposure to 25 mM ethanol upregulated the Oct4 and Nanog proteins, as well as the malignancy marker Ceacam6. DNA microarray analysis in cells exposed for 1 week showed upregulated expression of metallothionein genes, particularly MT1X. Long-term exposure upregulated expression of some malignancy related genes (STEAP4, SERPINA3, SAMD9, GDF15, KRT15, ITGB6, TP63, and PGR, as well as the CEACAM, interferon related, and HLA gene families). Some of these findings were validated by RT-PCR. A similar treatment also modulated numerous microRNAs (miRs) including one regulator of Oct4 as well as miRs involved in oncogenesis and/or malignancy, with only a few estrogen-induced miRs. Long-term 25 mM ethanol also induced a 5.6-fold upregulation of anchorage-independent growth, an indicator of malignant-like features. Exposure to acetaldehyde resulted in little or no effect comparable to that of ethanol. The previously shown alcohol induction of oncogenic transformation of normal breast cells is now complemented by the current results suggesting alcohol's potential involvement in malignant progression of breast cancer.",Int.

27797377,Cancer heterogeneity is not compatible with one unique cancer cell metabolic map.,"The Warburg effect and its accompanying metabolic features (anaplerosis, cataplerosis) are presented in textbooks and reviews as a hallmark (general characteristic): the metabolic map of cancer. On the other hand, research articles on specific tumors since a few years emphasize various biological features of different cancers, different cells in a cancer and the dynamic heterogeneity of these cells. We have analysed the research literature of the subject and show the generality of a dynamic, evolving biological and metabolic, spatial and temporal heterogeneity of individual cancers. We conclude that there is no one metabolic map of cancer but several and describe the two extremes of a panel from the hypoxic to the normoxic state. The implications for the significance of general 'omic' studies, and on therapeutic conclusions drawn from them and for the diagnostic use of fractional biopsies is discussed.",Oncogene,2017,"['Strickaert A', 'Saiselet M', 'Dom G', 'De Deken X', 'Dumont JE', 'Feron O', 'Sonveaux P', 'Maenhaut C']"
25974208,Quantitative proteomic analysis reveals that anti-cancer effects of selenium-binding protein 1 in vivo are associated with metabolic pathways.,"Previous studies have shown the tumor-suppressive role of selenium-binding protein 1 (SBP1), but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we found that induction of SBP1 showed significant inhibition of colorectal cancer cell growth and metastasis in mice. We further employed isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) to identify proteins that were involved in SBP1-mediated anti-cancer effects in tumor tissues. We identified 132 differentially expressed proteins, among them, 53 proteins were upregulated and 79 proteins were downregulated. Importantly, many of the differentially altered proteins were associated with lipid/glucose metabolism, which were also linked to Glycolysis, MAPK, Wnt, NF-kB, NOTCH and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signaling pathways. These results have revealed a novel mechanism that SBP1-mediated cancer inhibition is through altering lipid/glucose metabolic signaling pathways.

25268751,Fluvastatin mediated breast cancer cell death: a proteomic approach to identify differentially regulated proteins in MDA-MB-231 cells.,"Statins are increasingly being recognized as anti-cancer agents against various cancers including breast cancer. To understand the molecular pathways targeted by fluvastatin and its differential sensitivity against metastatic breast cancer cells, we analyzed protein alterations in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with fluvastatin using 2-DE in combination with LC-MS/MS. Results revealed dys-regulation of 39 protein spots corresponding to 35 different proteins. To determine the relevance of altered protein profiles with breast cancer cell death, we mapped these proteins to major pathways involved in the regulation of cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, cell cycle, Rho GDI and proteasomal pathways using IPA analysis. Highly interconnected sub networks showed that vimentin and ERK1/2 proteins play a central role in controlling the expression of altered proteins. Fluvastatin treatment caused proteolysis of vimentin, a marker of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. This effect of fluvastatin was reversed in the presence of mevalonate, a downstream product of HMG-CoA and caspase-3 inhibitor. Interestingly, fluvastatin neither caused an appreciable cell death nor did modulate vimentin expression in normal mammary epithelial cells. In conclusion, fluvastatin alters levels of cytoskeletal proteins, primarily targeting vimentin through increased caspase-3- mediated proteolysis, thereby suggesting a role for vimentin in statin-induced breast cancer cell death.

24148247,miR-181a-Twist1 pathway in the chemoresistance of tongue squamous cell carcinoma.,"Although many researches have been undertaken to disclose the mechanisms of chemoresistance, the mechanisms remain unclear. The aim of this study is to elucidate the role of miR-181a-Twist1 pathway in the chemoresistance of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC). We found that cisplatin-induced chemoresistance in TSCC cell lines underwent EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) and was accompanied by enhancing metastatic potential (migration and invasion in vitro), miR-181a downregulation and Twist1 upregulation. Functional analyses indicated that miR-181a reversed chemoresistance, inhibited EMT and metastatic potential in TSCC cells. Twist1 was confirmed as a direct miR-181a target gene by luciferase reporter gene assays. Twist1 knockdown by siRNA led to a reversal of the chemoresistance, inhibited EMT and metastatic potential in TSCC cells. Our study demonstrates that miR-181a-Twist1 pathway may play an important role in the development of cisplatin-chemoresistance, with EMT and an increase the metastatic potential of TSCC cells.

23796463,Adaptation and learning of molecular networks as a description of cancer development at the systems-level: potential use in anti-cancer therapies.,"There is a widening recognition that cancer cells are products of complex developmental processes. Carcinogenesis and metastasis formation are increasingly described as systems-level, network phenomena. Here we propose that malignant transformation is a two-phase process, where an initial increase of system plasticity is followed by a decrease of plasticity at late stages of carcinogenesis as a model of cellular learning. We describe the hallmarks of increased system plasticity of early, tumor initiating cells, such as increased noise, entropy, conformational and phenotypic plasticity, physical deformability, cell heterogeneity and network rearrangements. Finally, we argue that the large structural changes of molecular networks during cancer development necessitate a rather different targeting strategy in early and late phase of carcinogenesis. Plastic networks of early phase cancer development need a central hit, while rigid networks of late stage primary tumors or established metastases should be attacked by the network influence strategy, such as by edgetic, multi-target, or allo-network drugs. Cancer stem cells need special diagnosis and targeting, since their dormant and rapidly proliferating forms may have more rigid, or more plastic networks, respectively. The extremely high ability of cancer stem cells to change the rigidity/plasticity of their networks may be their key hallmark. The application of early stage-optimized anti-cancer drugs to late-stage patients may be a reason of many failures in anti-cancer therapies. Our hypotheses presented here underlie the need for patient-specific multi-target therapies applying the correct ratio of central hits and network influences - in an optimized sequence. ",Semin.

23407165,Strengthened glycolysis under hypoxia supports tumor symbiosis and hexosamine biosynthesis in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is one of the most intractable and fatal cancer. The decreased blood vessel density displayed by this tumor not only favors its resistance to chemotherapy but also participates in its aggressiveness due to the consequent high degree of hypoxia. It is indeed clear that hypoxia promotes selective pressure on malignant cells that must develop adaptive metabolic responses to reach their energetic and biosynthetic demands. Here, using a well-defined mouse model of pancreatic cancer, we report that hypoxic areas from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma are mainly composed of epithelial cells harboring epithelial-mesenchymal transition features and expressing glycolytic markers, two characteristics associated with tumor aggressiveness. We also show that hypoxia increases the ""glycolytic"" switch of pancreatic cancer cells from oxydative phosphorylation to lactate production and we demonstrate that increased lactate efflux from hypoxic cancer cells favors the growth of normoxic cancer cells. In addition, we show that glutamine metabolization by hypoxic pancreatic tumor cells is necessary for their survival. Metabolized glucose and glutamine converge toward a common pathway, termed hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, which allows O-linked N-acetylglucosamine modifications of proteins. Here, we report that hypoxia increases transcription of hexosamine biosynthetic pathway genes as well as levels of O-glycosylated proteins and that O-linked N-acetylglucosaminylation of proteins is a process required for hypoxic pancreatic cancer cell survival. Our results demonstrate that hypoxia-driven metabolic adaptive processes, such as high glycolytic rate and hexosamine biosynthetic pathway activation, favor hypoxic and normoxic cancer cell survival and correlate with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma aggressiveness.",Proc.
