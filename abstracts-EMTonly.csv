31892549,"SAHA and EGCG Promote Apoptosis in Triple-negative Breast Cancer Cells, Possibly Through the Modulation of cIAP2.","BACKGROUND/AIM: Inhibition of apoptosis is one of the hallmarks of cancer, and anti-apoptotic genes are often targets of genetic and epigenetic alterations. Cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2 (cIAP2) has a role in degrading caspases by linking them to ubiquitin molecules, and is upregulated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Previous studies have demonstrated that cIAP2 may play a role in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, was administered to triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells alone or in combination with epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor isolated from green tea.
RESULTS: The compounds were able to decrease the expression of cIAP2 while increasing the expression of pro-apoptotic caspase 7. There were also changes in histone modifications, suggesting a role of epigenetic mechanisms in these changes in expression of cIAP2. These changes resulted in an increase in apoptosis. SAHA and EGCG were also capable of limiting TNBC cell migration across a fibronectin (FN) matrix.
CONCLUSION: SAHA and EGCG reduce the metastatic potential of TNBC by inducing the apoptotic pathway.",Anticancer Res.,2020,"['Steed KL', 'Jordan HR', 'Tollefsbol TO']",

31778776,"Benzo(a)pyrene regulated A549 cell migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition by up-regulating long non-coding RNA linc00673.","As a major toxicant which is abundant in tobacco smoking, benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) is considered as a strong carcinogen of lung cancer. In spite of the intensive research, the role that BaP plays in lung cancer still lacks a comprehensive and precise understanding. Recently, a long non-coding RNA, linc00673, has emerged as a central player in different kinds of malignancies, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the present study, we found that BaP with the concentration of no more than 8 μM did not affect cell proliferation in the NSCLC cell line A549, while it significantly enhanced A549 cell migration and invasion. Further results revealed that BaP promoted mesenchymal biomarkers expression and inhibited the major epithelial biomarker E-cadherin in a time and dose dependent manner, which indicated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was induced by BaP in A549 cells. Through quantitative real-time PCR, we observed that BaP significantly elevated the expression level of linc00673. While after the knockdown of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), the up-regulating effect of BaP on linc00673 was reversed. Furthermore, silencing linc00673 significantly suppressed the BaP-induced migration, invasion, and EMT in A549 cells. In summary, our study demonstrates that BaP promotes A549 cell migration, invasion and EMT through up-regulating the expression of linc00673 in an AHR-dependent manner.",Toxicol.

31769973,6-C-(E-Phenylethenyl)Naringenin Attenuates the Stemness of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells by Suppressing Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling.,"The effect of a novel semi-natural derivative of naringenin, 6-C-(E-phenylethenyl)naringenin (6-CEPN) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) stemness was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. 6-CEPN reduced HCC cell viability, inhibited sphere formation, cell migration and invasion, and blocked epithelial-mesenchymal transition. It was equally effective against NANOG+ cells sorted from cultured HCC cells that was accompanied by downregulation of stemness-associated transcription factors and attenuated HIF-1 activity. Furthermore, 6-CEPN significantly enhanced the sensitivity of HCC cells to therapeutic drugs, and inhibited HCC tumor growth and lung metastasis of HCC cells. 6-CEPN suppressed Wnt/β-catenin signaling by inducing β-catenin degradation and inhibiting its nuclear translocation. Upregulation of GSK3β appeared to be crucial for 6-CEPN's inhibitory activity in the signaling pathway. These findings indicate that 6-CEPN has a strong effect against liver cancer, which is mediated, at least in part, by suppressing the stemness of HCC cells through an action mechanism involving Wnt/β-catenin signaling.",J.

31753509,Long non-coding RNA H19 and cancer: A competing endogenous RNA.,"Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is a class of non-coding RNA with a length of more than 200 nucleotides, which has become a hotspot in the research of tumorigenesis and development in recent years. Accumulating studies have indicated that H19 is abnormally expressed in human malignant tumors, and regulates cell proliferation, migration, invasion, anti-apoptosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition through various mechanisms, thus playing a carcinogenic or anti-cancer role. H19 has been found to act as a microRNA sponge to indirectly regulate the expression of microRNA downstream target genes thus mediating cancer progression in several cancer types. Even in the same cancer, H19 also sponges various microRNAs to mediate diverse regulatory mechanisms. Tissue-specific expression of H19 suggests that it may be an early diagnostic marker or prognostic indicator of cancers. In this review, we summarize the latest original researches, mainly focusing on the role of H19 sponging microRNAs in cancers. We hope this article can facilitate readers obtain the molecular mechanisms of H19 sponging miRNAs in cancers and provide a broad perspective for further research on cancer diagnosis and therapy.",Bull Cancer,2019,"['Ye Y', 'Shen A', 'Liu A']",
31732667,Combined mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibition blocks growth and induces catastrophic macropinocytosis in cancer cells.,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which plays a critical role in regulating cellular growth and metabolism, is aberrantly regulated in the pathogenesis of a variety of neoplasms. Here we demonstrate that dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitors OSI-027 and PP242 cause catastrophic macropinocytosis in rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) cells and cancers of the skin, breast, lung, and cervix, whereas the effects are much less pronounced in immortalized human keratinocytes. Using RMS as a model, we characterize in detail the mechanism of macropinocytosis induction. Macropinosomes are distinct from endocytic vesicles and autophagosomes in that they are single-membrane bound vacuoles formed by projection, ruffling, and contraction of plasma membranes. They are positive for EEA-1 and LAMP-1 and contain watery fluid but not organelles. The vacuoles then merge and rupture, killing the cells. We confirmed the inhibition of mTORC1/mTORC2 as the underpinning mechanism for macropinocytosis. Exposure to rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor, or mTORC2 knockdown alone had little or reduced effect relative to the combination. We further demonstrate that macropinocytosis depends on MKK4 activated by elevated reactive oxygen species. In a murine xenograft model, OSI-027 reduced RMS tumor growth. Molecular characterization of the residual tumors was consistent with the induction of macropinocytosis. Furthermore, relative to the control xenograft tumors, the residual tumors manifested reduced expression of cell proliferation markers and proteins that drive the epithelial mesenchymal transition. These data indicate a role of mTORC2 in regulating tumor growth by macropinocytosis and suggest that dual inhibitors could help block refractory or recurrent RMS and perhaps other neoplasms and other cancer as well.",Proc.

31729097,"Calcitriol inhibits migration and invasion of renal cell carcinoma cells by suppressing Smad2/3-, STAT3- and β-catenin-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition.","Low vitamin D status is associated with progression in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The present study found that vimentin, a mesenchymal marker, was accordingly upregulated, and E-cadherin, an epithelial marker, was downregulated in RCC patients with low vitamin D status. Thus, we investigated the effects of calcitriol or vitamin D3, an active form of vitamin D, on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in RCC cells. RCC cells were treated by two models. In model 1, three RCC cell lines, ACHN, 786-O and CAKI-2, were incubated with either LPS (2.0 μg/mL) or transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 (10 ng/mL) in the presence or absence of calcitriol (200 nmol/L). In model 2, two RCC cell lines, ACHN and CAKI-2, were incubated with calcitriol (200 nmol/L) only. Calcitriol inhibited migration and invasion not only in TGF-β1-stimulated but also in TGF-β1-unstimulated RCC cells. Moreover, calcitriol suppressed E-cadherin downregulation and vimentin upregulation not only in TGF-β1-stimulated but also in TGF-β1-unstimulated ACHN and CAKI-2 cells. Calcitriol attenuated LPS-induced upregulation of MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-9, MMP-26 and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) in ACHN cells. In addition, calcitriol blocked TGF-β1-induced nuclear translocation of ZEB1, Snail and Twist1 in ACHN and CAKI-2 cells. Mechanistically, calcitriol suppressed EMT through different signaling pathways: (i) calcitriol suppressed Smad2/3 phosphorylation by reinforcing physical interaction between vitamin D receptor (VDR) and Smad3 in TGF-β1-stimulated RCC cells; (ii) calcitriol inhibited signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 activation in LPS-stimulated RCC cells; (iii) calcitriol inhibited β-catenin/TCF-4 activation by promoting integration of VDR with β-catenin in TGF-β1-unstimulated RCC cells. Taken together, calcitriol inhibits migration and invasion of RCC cells partially by suppressing Smad2/3-, STAT3- and β-catenin-mediated EMT.",Cancer Sci.,2020,"['Xu S', 'Zhang ZH', 'Fu L', 'Song J', 'Xie DD', 'Yu DX', 'Xu DX', 'Sun GP']",

31715081,Circulating extracellular vesicle-encapsulated HULC is a potential biomarker for human pancreatic cancer.,"The role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is unclear. Some lncRNAs can be transferred by extracellular vesicles (EVs) and have potential as biomarkers. Here, we identify an lncRNA that could serve as a biomarker for PDAC and show the functional roles of the lncRNA. Expression profiling of lncRNAs revealed that highly upregulated in liver cancer (HULC) was highly expressed, and induced, by transforming growth factor-β in PDAC cells and their EVs. Knockdown of HULC decreased PDAC cell invasion and migration by inhibiting the EMT. Thus, HULC could be transferred by EVs, and promote EMT, invasion, and migration in recipient PDAC cells. To assess the roles of HULC, PDAC cell xenografts in nude mice were established. Knockdown of HULC in PDAC cells implanted in mice inhibited tumor growth. Moreover, microRNA-133b suppressed PDAC cell invasion and migration by inhibiting the EMT through targeting HULC. Furthermore, serum samples were obtained from 20 PDAC and 22 intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) patients, as well as 21 healthy individuals. Analysis of serum EV HULC expression by digital PCR showed that HULC expression was significantly increased in PDAC patients compared to healthy individuals or IPMN patients. Additionally, HULC showed good predictive performance for discriminating PDAC, suggesting that the analysis of EV-encapsulated HULC would contribute to the diagnosis for human PDAC. Extracellular vesicle-transported HULC promotes cell invasion and migration by inducing the EMT, and microRNA-133b suppresses the EMT by targeting HULC. Extracellular vesicle-encapsulated HULC could be a potential circulating biomarker for human PDAC.",Cancer Sci.,2020,"['Takahashi K', 'Ota Y', 'Kogure T', 'Suzuki Y', 'Iwamoto H', 'Yamakita K', 'Kitano Y', 'Fujii S', 'Haneda M', 'Patel T', 'Ota T']",
31704861,Twist and Snail/Slug Expression in Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma in Correlation With Lymph Node Metastasis.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) could be clinically undetectable despite the relatively large size of lymph node metastases. Here, we aimed to elucidate the correlation of p16 expression with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Radically resected 121 OPSCC and 270 non-OPSCC tissue samples were included in the analysis, and p16, Twist, and Snail/Slug immunohistochemistry was performed.
RESULTS: Compared to non-OPSCCs, OPSCCs were significantly associated with lymphovascular invasion, lymph node metastasis, larger maximal diameter of metastatic foci in the lymph nodes, and p16 expression. In addition, p16 expression correlated with high Twist and Snail/Slug expression.
CONCLUSION: Expression of EMT markers, such as Twist and Snail/Slug, is related to p16 expression in OPSCC. This might indicate that HPV infection in OPSCCs alters the expression of EMT markers and results in metastases.",Anticancer Res.,2019,"['Cho YA', 'Kim EK', 'Cho BC', 'Koh YW', 'Yoon SO']",
31704812,Cytoplasmic Mineralocorticoid Receptor Expression Predicts Dismal Local Relapse-free Survival in Non-triple-negative Breast Cancer.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: The aim of the study was to investigate the prognostic role of androgen receptor (AR), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and glucocorticoid receptor β (GRβ) expression in HER-2 negative breast cancer patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population (n=152) was enriched with triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) (n=96; 63.2%). The median follow-up time was 100 months. AR, MR and GRβ immunocytochemical staining was compared with that of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (vimentin, SIP1, ZEB1).
RESULTS: High expression of cytoplasmic MR was associated with dismal local relapse-free survival (RR=13.923; 95%CI=1.071-181.045; p=0.044) in tumours with non-TNBC phenotype. AR and GRβ were more frequently expressed in ER+/PR+/HER2- tumours, while cytoplasmic MR was more often expressed in TNBC tumours (for all, p<0.0005). GRβ and AR were associated with decreased vimentin expression (p<0.005), indicating their association with attenuated EMT.
CONCLUSION: Cytoplasmic MR expression is a strong predictor of local recurrence in non-metastatic breast cancer patients with non-TNBC tumour phenotype.",Anticancer Res.,2019,"['Jääskeläinen A', 'Jukkola A', 'Haapasaari KM', 'Auvinen P', 'Soini Y', 'Karihtala P']",
31697952,Taurine up-regulated 1 accelerates tumorigenesis of colon cancer by regulating miR-26a-5p/MMP14/p38 MAPK/Hsp27 axis in vitro and in vivo.,"AIMS: The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of long non-coding RNA taurine-upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) in colon cancer (Cc) and related molecular mechanisms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: RT-qPCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the expression of related proteins. BrdU and Transwell assays were used to detect cell proliferation and invasion, respectively. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the expression of Vimentin.
KEY FINDINGS: TUG1 expression was up-regulated in CaCO-2, SW620 and HT-29 cells, while miR-26a-5p was down-regulated. Bioinformatics analysis showed that miR-26a-5p was the target of TUG1, and the targeting relationship was further confirmed by dual-luciferase report analysis. Besides, matrix metalloproteinases-14 (MMP-14) was a target of mir-26a-5p. Knockdown of TUG1 by shRNA (sh-TUG1) inhibited MMP-14 expression. Functional analysis showed that sh-TUG1 significantly inhibited Cc cell proliferation, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT). Notably, miR-26a-5p inhibitor reversed the promotion of Cc caused by sh-TUG1. Mechanically, the overexpression of TUG1 significantly up-regulated the levels of MMP-14, VEGF, p-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p-p38 MAPK) and p-HSP27 (heat shock protein 27), and promoted the proliferation, invasion and EMT of Cc cells. However, MAPK pathway inhibitor SB203580 has shown the opposite effect. Additionally, animal studies have shown that sh-TUG1 inhibited tumor growth and motility in vivo in the same way.
SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrated that TUG1 accelerates the development of colon cancer by regulating miR-26a-5p/MMP14/p38 MAPK/Hsp27 axis in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, TUG1 provides a new direction for the treatment of Cc.",Life Sci.,2019,"['Tian L', 'Zhao ZF', 'Xie L', 'Zhu JP']",
31666716,Controversies around epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity in cancer metastasis.,"Experimental evidence accumulated over decades has implicated epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP), which collectively encompasses epithelial-mesenchymal transition and the reverse process of mesenchymal-epithelial transition, in tumour metastasis, cancer stem cell generation and maintenance, and therapeutic resistance. However, the dynamic nature of EMP processes, the apparent need to reverse mesenchymal changes for the development of macrometastases and the likelihood that only minor cancer cell subpopulations exhibit EMP at any one time have made such evidence difficult to accrue in the clinical setting. In this Perspectives article, we outline the existing preclinical and clinical evidence for EMP and reflect on recent controversies, including the failure of initial lineage-tracing experiments to confirm a major role for EMP in dissemination, and discuss accumulating data suggesting that epithelial features and/or a hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal phenotype are important in metastasis. We also highlight strategies to address the complexities of therapeutically targeting the EMP process that give consideration to its spatially and temporally divergent roles in metastasis, with the view that this will yield a potent and broad class of therapeutic agents.",Nat.

31646523,Calcium Signaling and the Regulation of Chemosensitivity in Cancer Cells: Role of the Transient Receptor Potential Channels.,"Cancer cells acquire the ability to modify the calcium signaling network by altering the expression and functions of cation channels, pumps or transporters. Calcium signaling pathways are involved in proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, immune evasion, disruption of cell death pathways, ECM remodelling, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and drug resistance. Among cation channels, a pivotal role is played by the Transient Receptor Potential non-selective cation-permeable receptors localized in plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria and lysosomes. Several findings indicate that the dysregulation in calcium signaling induced by TRP channels is responsible for cancer growth, metastasis and chemoresistance. Drug resistance represents a major limitation in the application of current therapeutic regimens and several efforts are spent to overcome it. Here we describe the ability of Transient Receptor Potential Channels to modify, by altering the intracellular calcium influx, the cancer cell sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs.",Adv. Exp. Med.

31637536,Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 39 regulates the process of proliferation and migration of human ovarian cancer via p53/p21 pathway and EMT.,"Ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal gynecological cancers; owning to its late detection and chemoresistance, understanding the pathogenesis of this malignant tumor is much critical. Previous studies have reported that ubiquitin-specific peptidase 39 (USP39) is generally overexpressed in a variety of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer and so forth. Furthermore, USP39 is proved to be associated with the proliferation of malignant tumors. However, the function and mechanism of USP39 in ovarian cancer have not been elucidated. In the present study, we observed that USP39 was frequently overexpressed in human ovarian cancer and was highly correlated with TNM stage. Suppression of USP39 markedly inhibited the growth and migration of ovarian cancer cell lines HO-8910 and SKOV3 and induced cell cycle G2/M arrest. Moreover, knockdown of USP39 inhibited ovarian tumor growth in a xenograft model. In addition, our findings indicated that cell cycle arrest induced by USP39 knockdown might be involved in p53/p21 signaling pathway. Furthermore, we found that the depletion of USP39 inhibited the migration of ovarian cancer cells via blocking epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Taken together, these results suggest that USP39 may play vital roles in the genesis and progression and may serve as a potential biomarker for diagnosis and therapeutic target of ovarian cancer.",Med.

31617652,Kinesin family member 18B: A contributor and facilitator in the proliferation and metastasis of cutaneous melanoma.,"Melanoma is the most aggressive type of cutaneous tumor and the occurrence of metastasis makes it resistant to almost all available treatment and becomes incorrigible. Hence, identifying metastasis-related biomarkers and effective therapeutic targets will assist in preventing metastasis and ameliorating cutaneous melanoma. In our present study, we reported kinesin family member 18B (KIF18B) as a novel contributor in cutaneous melanoma proliferation and metastasis, and it was found to be of great significance in predicting the prognosis of cutaneous melanoma patients. Bioinformatics analysis based on ONCOMINE, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and Genotype-Tissue Expression database revealed that KIF18B was highly expressed in cutaneous melanoma and remarkably correlated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. Consistently, the results of the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction exhibited that the expression of KIF18B was significantly higher in cutaneous melanoma cell lines than that in normal cells. In vitro, biological assays found that knockdown of KIF18B in cutaneous melanoma cells noticeably repressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while inducing cell apoptosis. Moreover, the protein expression of E-cadherin was enhanced while the expression of N-cadherin, vimentin, and Snail was decreased in M14 cells after knocking down KIF18B. In addition, the phosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was significantly suppressed in M14 cells with silenced KIF18B. Above all, our results indicated that the repression of cutaneous melanoma cell migration and proliferation caused by KIF18B depletion suggested an oncogenic role of KIF18B in cutaneous melanoma, which acts through modulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition and ERK/PI3K pathway.",J.

31607134,Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition via TGF-β1/Smad pathway in hepatic carcinoma cells.,"Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) is dysregulated in a number of human cancers. Herein, we report that PRMT1 expression is directly associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in hepatic carcinoma cells. Firstly, we find that PRMT1 expression is higher in hepatic carcinoma tissues than that in normal liver tissues at both mRNA and protein levels, and higher expression of PRMT1 correlates with poor survival in liver tumors. The data in vitro reveals that PRMT1 knockdown inhibits the abilities of proliferation, migration and invasion, while PRMT1 overexpression promotes the above behaviors in hepatic carcinoma cells. Further studies indicate that PRMT1 knockdown remarkably decreases the expression of mesenchymal markers including Vimentin, Snail and N-cadherin, and upregulates expression of epithelial markers E-cadherin. Conversely, PRMT1 overexpression results in the opposite effects. Additionally, we identified that PRMT1 knockdown resulted in downregulation of TGF-β1, p-Smad2 and p-Smad3, while PRMT1 overexpression activated TGF-β1, p-Smad2 and p-Smad3. These findings suggest that PRMT1 promotes EMT in hepatic carcinoma cells probably via TGF-β1/Smad pathway, and might represent a novel anti-liver cancer strategy.",Neoplasma,2019,"['Wei H', 'Liu Y', 'Min J', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang J', 'Zhou M', 'Xiong E', 'Yu G', 'Zhou H', 'He J', 'Zeng J', 'Gong A', 'Xu M']",

Further, the abilities of proliferation, migration and invasion in pancreatic cancer cells were inhibited by ME3 knockdown and were promoted by ME3 overexpression. Meanwhile, ME3 can promote EMT in pancreatic cancer cells possibly by regulation of TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling pathway.

31586262,Outcome in serous ovarian cancer is not associated with LATS expression.,"BACKGROUND: Large tumor suppressor (LATS) proteins are putative tumor suppressors and poorly expressed associated with poor outcome in many cancers. A recent immunohistochemistry study showed that LATS protein expression correlated with poor outcome in serous ovarian cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed LATS expression in various ovarian cancer transcriptomic data sets and immunohistochemically assessed LATS protein expression in a Swiss ovarian tumor cohort. Results were compared to clinicopathological characteristics and outcome. We also compared LATS protein expression in serous ovarian cancer cell lines to their EMT status (Western blotting) and drug sensitivity (MTT assay).
RESULTS: The analysis of 15 different transcriptomic data sets showed that LATS2 was associated with poorer outcome, while LATS1 was irrelevant (HR = 1.19 and HR = 1.00, respectively). The TCGA-RNASeqV2 data set showed that low LATS1 and LATS2 were associated with better survival in serous ovarian carcinoma. Despite heterogeneity among the different data sets, LATS expression is not an indicator of survival in serous ovarian cancer and LATS2 expression may even be tumorigenic. LATS expression was neither associated with survival nor with the stage and grade in the Swiss cohort. It was low in cystadenoma, intermediate in carcinoma, and high in borderline tumors and was higher in serous than mucinous ovarian carcinoma. LATS protein expression extent was comparable in epithelial-, intermediate-, and mesenchymal-type ovarian cancer cells and was not associated with drug sensitivity.
CONCLUSION: These results are largely incompatible with a tumor-suppressive function of LATS in ovarian cancer, and LATS protein level is also not an indicator for drug sensitivity and EMT status of ovarian cancer cells.",J.

31580991,Oxygenated Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Oxy-PAHs) facilitate lung cancer metastasis by epigenetically regulating the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).,"Oxygenated Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Oxy-PAHs) are widely distributed in the atmosphere, water, soil and sediments. Oxy-PAHs have been proved more carcinogenic than their parent PAHs, while there still lack of studies about the toxicological mechanism of Oxy-PAHs in epigenetic regulation. Our study revealed that exposure to Oxy-PAHs induced the invasion and migration of lung epithelial cells by the activation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), including the up-regulation of Vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and the down-regulation of E-cadherin (E-cad). The reactive oxygen species (ROS) promoted histone acetylation mediated-Snail regulating the expression of E-cad after Oxy-PAHs treatment. Meanwhile, DNA methylation was also involved in epigenetic regulation of EMT. These results demonstrated a potential mechanism about Oxy-PAHs facilitate lung carcinogenesis by epigenetic regulation and suggested new ways for the treatment, improvement, and prevention of lung cancer caused by Oxy-PAHs environmental exposure.",Environ.

31574306,"Cigarette smoke extract modulates E-Cadherin, Claudin-1 and miR-21 and promotes cancer invasiveness in human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells.","BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoke is considered a risk factor for lung and colorectal cancer. A convincing link between epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) with colorectal cancer progression and therapeutic resistance has emerged. Deregulated expression of E-Cadherin and Claudin-1 and increased miR-21 expression and invasiveness represent hallmarks of EMT. The effects of cigarette smoke exposure on EMT in colorectal adenocarcinoma cells are largely unknown.
AIM: The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) on miR-21, Claudin-1 and E-Cadherin, molecules associated to EMT in colorectal cancer cells.
METHODS: A human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (Caco-2) was treated with CSE at different concentration (5% and 10%) and for different time points (3 h and 24 h). Metabolic activity (by MTS assay), cell necrosis/cell apoptosis (evaluating Propidium Iodide/Annexin V expression by flow cytometry), miR-21, Claudin-1 and E-Cadherin gene expression were evaluated by Real time PCR. Cell permeability, actin polymerization and cancer cell migration was assessed by Trans-Epitelial Electrical Resistance (TEER), Phalloidin expression and matrigel system, respectively.
RESULTS: CSE at all the tested concentrations and at all time points reduced cell necrosis. CSE at 10% increased miR-21 and reduced the metabolic activity, cell necrosis, Claudin-1 and E-cadherin mRNA at 3 h. Cell permeability, actin polymerization and cancer cell migration were all increased upon CSE exposure.
CONCLUSION: These results showed that CSE increasing miR-21, Claudin-1 and E-Cadherin and enhancing the aggressiveness of cancer cells, may concur to colorectal cancer progression.",Toxicol. Lett.,2019,"['Dino P', ""D'Anna C"", 'Sangiorgi C', 'Di Sano C', 'Di Vincenzo S', 'Ferraro M', 'Pace E']",
31562303,The CXCL5/CXCR2 axis is sufficient to promote breast cancer colonization during bone metastasis.,"Bone is one of the most common sites for metastasis across cancers. Cancer cells that travel through the vasculature and invade new tissues can remain in a non-proliferative dormant state for years before colonizing the metastatic site. Switching from dormancy to colonization is the rate-limiting step of bone metastasis. Here we develop an ex vivo co-culture method to grow cancer cells in mouse bones to assess cancer cell proliferation using healthy or cancer-primed bones. Profiling soluble factors from conditioned media identifies the chemokine CXCL5 as a candidate to induce metastatic colonization. Additional studies using CXCL5 recombinant protein suggest that CXCL5 is sufficient to promote breast cancer cell proliferation and colonization in bone, while inhibition of its receptor CXCR2 with an antagonist blocks proliferation of metastatic cancer cells. This study suggests that CXCL5 and CXCR2 inhibitors may have efficacy in treating metastatic bone tumors dependent on the CXCL5/CXCR2 axis.",Nat Commun,2019,"['Romero-Moreno R', 'Curtis KJ', 'Coughlin TR', 'Miranda-Vergara MC', 'Dutta S', 'Natarajan A', 'Facchine BA', 'Jackson KM', 'Nystrom L', 'Li J', 'Kaliney W', 'Niebur GL', 'Littlepage LE']",
31554791,c-Met activation leads to the establishment of a TGFβ-receptor regulatory network in bladder cancer progression.,"Treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer remains a major clinical challenge. Aberrant HGF/c-MET upregulation and activation is frequently observed in bladder cancer correlating with cancer progression and invasion. However, the mechanisms underlying HGF/c-MET-mediated invasion in bladder cancer remains unknown. As part of a negative feedback loop SMAD7 binds to SMURF2 targeting the TGFβ receptor for degradation. Under these conditions, SMAD7 acts as a SMURF2 agonist by disrupting the intramolecular interactions within SMURF2. We demonstrate that HGF stimulates TGFβ signalling through c-SRC-mediated phosphorylation of SMURF2 resulting in loss of SMAD7 binding and enhanced SMURF2 C2-HECT interaction, inhibiting SMURF2 and enhancing TGFβ receptor stabilisation. This upregulation of the TGFβ pathway by HGF leads to TGFβ-mediated EMT and invasion. In vivo we show that TGFβ receptor inhibition prevents bladder cancer invasion. Furthermore, we make a rationale for the use of combinatorial TGFβ and MEK inhibitors for treatment of high-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancers.",Nat Commun,2019,"['Sim WJ', 'Iyengar PV', 'Lama D', 'Lui SKL', 'Ng HC', 'Haviv-Shapira L', 'Domany E', 'Kappei D', 'Tan TZ', 'Saei A', 'Jaynes PW', 'Verma CS', 'Kumar AP', 'Rouanne M', 'Ha HK', 'Radulescu C', 'Ten Dijke P', 'Eichhorn PJA', 'Thiery JP']",

A more in-depth analysis of lung cancer subtypes is needed to identify BMP-related therapeutic targets. We sought to examine the influence of BMP signaling on the viability, growth and migration properties of the cell line LCLC-103H, which originates from a large cell lung carcinoma with giant cells and an extended aneuploidy.
METHODS: We used BMP-4 and LDN-214117 as agonist/antagonist system for the BMP receptor type I signaling. Using flow cytometry, wound healing assay, trans-well assay and spheroid culture, we examined the influence of BMP signaling on cell viability, growth and migration. Molecular mechanisms underlying observed changes in cell migration were investigated via gene expression analysis of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers.
RESULTS: BMP signaling inhibition resulted in LCLC-103H cell apoptosis and necrosis 72 h after LDN-214117 treatment. Cell growth and proliferation are markedly affected by BMP signaling inhibition. Chemotactic motility and migratory ability of LCLC-103H cells were clearly hampered by LDN-214117 treatment. Cell migration changes after BMP signaling inhibition were shown to be coupled with considerable down-regulation of transcription factors involved in EMT, especially Snail.
CONCLUSIONS: BMP signaling inhibition in LCLC-103H cells leads to reduced growth and proliferation, hindered migration and accelerated cell death. The findings contribute to the pool of evidence on BMP signaling in lung cancer with a possibility of introducing BMP signaling inhibition as a novel therapeutic approach for the disease.",J.

TNNT1 expression in COAD tissues and its prognostic significance were acquired from TCGA database. The proliferative, migratory, and invasive abilities of COAD cells were detected by CCK-8 and transwell assays, respectively. Correlations between TNNT1 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related markers were determined using western blotting and Pearson's analysis. Our results stated that TNNT1 expression was high-regulated in COAD tissues, which was related with unfavorable prognosis of COAD patients. Functional analyses suggested that TNNT1 promoted the cellular behaviors. Moreover, aberrant expression of TNNT1 affected the expression level of EMT-related proteins. And TNNT1 was negatively linked with E-cadherin.

31512281,Silencing long noncoding RNA OGFRP1 inhibits the proliferation and migration of cervical carcinoma cells.,"Cervical cancer is still a serious threat to women's health and life safety worldwide, and new treatment strategies are urgently needed. Accumulating evidences also imply that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in a wide range of cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle. We found that the expression of lncOGFRP1 in cervical cancer tissues was significantly higher than that in normal cervical tissues (P < .05). Further, CCK8 detection found when lncOGFRP1 was silenced, the proliferation of cells was inhibited. After depleting lncOGFRP1, the proportion of apoptosis cells in C33A (3.71 ± 0.38% VS 11.98 ± 1.26%, P < .05) and SiHa (0.69 ± 0.06% VS 11.06 ± 1.03%, P < .05) cells increased significantly, and cell cycle was arrested in S phase. On the other hand, migration detection found the migration of cells also was hindered when lncOGFRP1 level was reduced. And the depletion of lncOGFRP1 inhibited the expression of β-catenin, Vimentin, N-cadherin, and SNAIL and promoted the expression of E-cadherin. In summary, we first discovered the high expression of lncOGFRP1 in cervical cancer and revealed that silencing lncOGFRP1 inhibits the proliferation and migration of cervical carcinoma cells. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: We first discovered the high expression of lncOGFRP1 in cervical cancer and revealed that silencing lncOGFRP1 inhibits the proliferation and migration of cervical carcinoma cells.

31505062,E-cadherin-Fc chimera protein matrix enhances cancer stem-like properties and induces mesenchymal features in colon cancer cells.,"Cancer stem cells (CSC) are a subpopulation of tumor cells with properties of high tumorigenicity and drug resistance, which lead to recurrence and poor prognosis. Although a better understanding of CSC is essential for developing cancer therapies, scarcity of the CSC population has hindered such analyses. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether the E-cadherin-Fc chimera protein (E-cad-Fc) enhances cancer stem-like properties because studies show that soluble E-cadherin stimulates human epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) and downstream signaling pathways that are reported to play a crucial role in CSC. For this purpose, we used ornithine decarboxylase (ODC)-degron-transduced (Degron(+)) KM12SM cells as a CSC model that retains relatively low CSC properties. Compared to cultures without E-cad-Fc treatment, we found that E-cad-Fc treatment further suppressed proteasome activity and largely enhanced cancer stem-like properties of ODC-degron-transduced KM12SM cells. These results include increased expression of stem cell markers Lgr5, Bmi-1, SOX9, CD44, and CD44v9, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), and enhancement of robust spheroid formation, and chemoresistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and oxaliplatin (L-OHP). These effects could be attributed to activation of the EGFR pathway as identified by extensive phosphorylation of EGFR, ERK, PI3K, AKT, and mTOR. In SW480 cells, E-cad-Fc matrix induced some CSC markers such as CD44v9 and ALDH. We also found that E-cad-Fc matrix showed high efficiency of inducing mesenchymal changes in colon cancer cells.

We previously reported that colon cancer-derived EVs contain abundant miR-92a-3p and have a pro-angiogenic function. We previously identified Dickkopf-3 (Dkk-3) as a direct target of miR-92a-3p; however, the pro-angiogenic function of miR-92a-3p cannot only be attributed to downregulation of Dkk-3. Therefore, the complete molecular mechanism by which miR-92a-3p exerts pro-angiogenic effects is still unclear. Here, we comprehensively analyzed the gene sets affected by ectopic expression of miR-92a-3p in endothelial cells to elucidate processes underlying EV-induced angiogenesis. We found that the ectopic expression of miR-92a-3p upregulated cell cycle- and mitosis-related gene expression and downregulated adhesion-related gene expression in endothelial cells. We also identified a novel target gene of miR-92a-3p, claudin-11. Claudin-11 belongs to the claudin gene family, which encodes essential components expressed at tight junctions (TJs). Disruption of TJs with a concomitant loss of claudin expression is a significant event in the process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of TIS111D in bladder cancer and adjacent tissues was assessed by immunohistochemistry, Western blot and real-time PCR. Western blot and real-time PCR were used to analyse the expression of TIS111D in HT1197, T24, 5637 and TCCSUP cells. After TIS111D was silenced in T24, 5637 and TCCSUP cells, MTT and Transwell assays were used to detect the effects of TIS111D on proliferation and migration. Western blot and real-time PCR were used to detect the regulatory effect of downregulation of TIS111D on N-cad and E-cad. In vivo experiments confirmed the role of TIS111D in the growth and migration of bladder cancer and determined whether the role of TIS111D in bladder cancer is related to its regulation of N-cad and E-cad.
KEY FINDINGS: The expression of TIS11D was higher in tumour tissues and bladder cancer cells. Si-TIS111D could inhibit the growth and migration of bladder cancer cells, while TIS111D could regulate the expression of E-cad and N-cad to regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We also demonstrated that TIS111D could promote the growth and migration of bladder cancer in vivo by regulating EMT.

In the present study, we found that SNHG7 expression was significantly upregulated in hepatic carcinoma tissues, especially in aggressive cases, and it was closely correlated with the poor prognosis. Furthermore, knockdown of SNHG7 inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of hepatic carcinoma cell lines in vitro. Mechanistically, SNHG7 directly interacted with miR-425 as a ceRNA.

31477177,An essential role of RNF187 in Notch1 mediated metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: Aberrant activation of Notch signaling has been causally linked to the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), however the underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. RING finger protein 187 (RNF187) was recently revealed to be a driver of several cancers, but its expression pattern and biological function in HCC are unknown.
METHODS: The expression levels of Notch1 and RNF187 were assessed in two independent cohorts of HCC tissues, and modulation of Notch1 in HCC cells was performed to explore the regulatory role of Notch1 in HCC metastasis. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporter analysis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) were used to clarify the relationship between Notch1 signaling and its potential target Ring finger protein 187 (RNF187). Gain- and loss-of-function studies were used to dissect the role of Notch1-RNF187 signaling in promoting HCC metastasis. The impact of Notch1-RNF187 activity in determining clinical prognosis for HCC patients was evaluated by multivariate Cox regression.
RESULTS: By RNA-seq, luciferase reporter analysis, and ChIP assay, RNF187 was confirmed to be a direct transcriptional target of Notch1, as Notch1 could activate RNF187 promoter whereas the pro-migratory and pro-invasive effects of Notch1 were significantly attenuated by RNF187 knockdown. Meanwhile, RNF187 silencing could attenuate the Notch1-dependent epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, overexpression of RNF187 counteracted the inhibitory effect of Notch1 knockdown on cancer progression. Importantly, HCC patients with high level of hepatic Notch1 expression had shorter disease-free survival (DFS) than those with low level of hepatic Notch1 expression. Furthermore, patients with high level of Notch1 and RNF187 co-expression showed the shortest DFS. The expression level of Notch1 and RNF187 was an independent prognostic factor for HCC.
CONCLUSIONS: For the first time we identified that RNF187 is an essential factor for Notch1 to promote invasion and metastasis of HCC. Of highly clinical relevance, we found that activation of Notch1-RNF187 correlates with a worse prognosis of HCC patients.

However, the precise biological of FER1L4 in OS has not been cleared. The aim of this study is to investigate the roles and potential mechanisms of FER1L4 in apoptosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in OS. In the present study, the levels of FER1L4 were decreased significantly in OS tissues and cell lines compared with non-tumorous tissues or hFOB1.19. Knockdown of FER1L4 in OS cells decreased the apoptosis rate, but increased the OS cell proliferation, upregulated the expression levels of CD133 and Nanog, as well as promoted Twist1 expression, increased the N-cadherin and Vimentin expression. In turn, the opposite trends were observed upon overexpression of FER1L4. In addition, the expression of PI3K, p-AKT (Ser470) and p-AKT (Thr308) was upregulated by siFER1L4, while decreased upon overexpression of FER1L4. MicroRNA (miRNA) -18a-5p, an osteosarcoma-promoting miRNA which was suggested a target of FER1L4 in osteosarcoma, was identified to be a functional target of FER1L4 on the regulating of cell apoptosis and EMT, presently. The effects of FER1L4 overexpression on the markers of cell apoptosis, proliferation, EMT, and stemness and PI3K/AKT signaling were all reversed by miR-18a-5p upregulation. Furthermore, the suppressor of cytokine signaling 5 (SOCS5) was confirmed a target gene of miR-18a-5p by luciferase gene reporter assay and SOCS5 suppression by miR-18a-5p attenuated the effects of FER1L4 overexpression on the OS cells apoptosis and the expressed levels of PI3K, AKT, Twist1, N-cadherin and Vimentin.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the correlation between GC development and ECM1 expression, along with its regulation by microRNAs. Immunohistochemical results showed that ECM1 was up-regulated in GC tissues and ECM1 expression level was negatively correlated with the prognosis of GC. ECM1 was found to promote gastric cancer cell metastasis in cell migration assays by facilitating the expression of proteins involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). MiR-92a was recognized for the first time to suppress the migration of human GC cells by directly targeting to the 3'UTR of ECM1 gene in a dual-luciferase reporter assay.

Here, we evaluated the biological roles of TRIM66, a member of TRIM family, in the progression of CRC. The results demonstrated that TRIM66 was markedly up-regulated in both CRC tissues and cell lines. To further investigate the functions of TRIM66 in CRC, CRC cells were infected with lentivirus expressing anti-TRIM66 shRNA (sh-TRIM66) or control lentivirus (sh-con). We found that knockdown of TRIM66 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion of CRC cells. TRIM66 knockdown also suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as proved by the increased E-cadherin expression and decreased expressions of N-cadherin and vimentin. Furthermore, TRIM66 knockdown markedly inhibited tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. Knockdown of TRIM66 reduced the activation of JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in CRC cells. Treatment with AG490, an inhibitor of JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, enhanced the inhibitory effects of TRIM66 knockdown on cell proliferation, migration and invasion.

using Human VDR enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Changes in E-cadherin gene expression were
analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Also, changes in CD44+ cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.
Finally, morphological changes were investigated by light microscopy after 6 days. Results: Treatment of HCC1806
cells with IL-6 has no significant effect either on E-cadherin gene expression or CD44+ cells, (p > 0.05). However,
E-cadherin gene expression was significantly up-regulated after treatment with 1,25D for 6 days, (p < 0.05). Also, CD44+
cells were significantly reduced after treatment with 1,25D either for 3 or 6 days, (p < 0.05). Transfection of TNBC
cell line with VDR gene significantly up-regulated VDR protein expression, (p < 0.05). In addition, overexpression of
VDR in TNBC cells and treatment with 1,25D significantly up-regulated E-cadherin gene expression, (p < 0.05) and
reduced CD44+ cells, (p < 0.05). Moreover, transfection with VDR and treatment with a combination of 1,25D and
IL-6 significantly down-regulated E-cadherin gene expression and increased CD44+ cells compared with transfected
cells with VDR treated with 1,25D alone, (p < 0.05). No significant morphological changes were observed in treated
cells, 6 days post-treatment. Conclusion: The presence of IL-6 in the breast tumor microenvironment may impair the

31450710,Role of Cancer Stem Cells in Cholangiocarcinoma and Therapeutic Implications.,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is the second most common type of liver cancer, and is highly aggressive with very poor prognosis. CCA is classified into intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) and extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma (eCCA), which is further stratified into perihilar (pCCA) and distal (dCCA). Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of cancer cells capable of tumor initiation and malignant growth, and are also responsible for chemoresistance. Thus, CSCs play an important role in CCA carcinogenesis. Surface markers such as CD133, CD24, CD44, EpCAM, Sox2, CD49f, and CD117 are important for identifying and isolating CCA CSCs. CSCs are present in the tumor microenvironment (TME), termed 'CSC niche', where cellular components and soluble factors interact to promote tumor initiation. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is another important mechanism underlying carcinogenesis, involved in the invasiveness, metastasis and chemoresistance of cancer. It has been demonstrated that EMT plays a critical role in generating CSCs. Therapies targeting the surface markers and signaling pathways of CCA CSCs, proteins involved in TME, and immune checkpoint proteins are currently under investigation. Therefore, this review focuses on recent studies on the roles of CSCs in CCA; the possible therapeutic strategies targeting CSCs of CCA are also discussed.",Int J Mol Sci,2019,"['Wu HJ', 'Chu PY']",
31446643,"SHR-A1403, a novel c-mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-Met) antibody-drug conjugate, overcomes AZD9291 resistance in non-small cell lung cancer cells overexpressing c-Met.","Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have been used as the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harboring EGFR-activating mutations, but acquired resistance is ubiquitous and needs to be solved urgently. Here, we introduce an effective approach for overcoming resistance to the EGFR-TKI, AZD9291, in NSCLC cells using SHR-A1403, a novel c-mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-Met)-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of an anti-c-Met monoclonal antibody (c-Met mAb) conjugated to a microtubule inhibitor. Resistant cells were established by exposing HCC827 to increasing concentrations of EGFR-TKI. c-Met was found to be overexpressed in most resistant cells. AZD9291 resistance was partially restored by combination of AZD9291 and crizotinib only in resistant cells overexpressing phospho-c-Met, which synergistically inhibited c-Met-mediated phosphorylation of the downstream targets ERK1/2 and AKT. In resistant cells overexpressing c-Met, neither crizotinib nor c-Met mAb was able to overcome AZD9291 resistance. In contrast, SHR-A1403 strongly inhibited proliferation of AZD9291-resistant HCC827 overexpressing c-Met, regardless of the levels of c-Met phosphorylation. SHR-A1403 bound to resistant cells overexpressing c-Met was internalized into cells and released associated microtubule inhibitor, resulting in cell-killing activity that was dependent on c-Met expression levels only, irrespective of the involvement of c-Met or EGFR signaling in AZD9291 resistance. Consistent with its activity in vitro, SHR-A1403 significantly inhibited the growth of AZD9291-resistant HCC827 tumors and caused tumor regression in vivo. Thus, our findings show that SHR-A1403 efficiently overcomes AZD9291 resistance in cells overexpressing c-Met, and further indicate that c-Met expression level is a biomarker predictive of SHR-A1403 efficacy.",Cancer Sci.,2019,"['Tong M', 'Gao M', 'Xu Y', 'Fu L', 'Li Y', 'Bao X', 'Fu H', 'Quan H', 'Lou L']",

31432592,G9a and histone deacetylases are crucial for Snail2-mediated E-cadherin repression and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Functional E-cadherin loss, a hallmark of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), is important for metastasis. However, the mechanism of Snail2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) EMT and metastasis remains unclear. Here, we showed that Snail2 was upregulated in primary HCC, and significantly increased during transforming growth factor-β-induced liver cell EMT. Snail2-overexpressing and knockdown cell lines have been established to determine its function in EMT in HCC. H3K9 methylation was upregulated and H3K4 and H3K56 acetylation were downregulated at the E-cadherin promoter in Snail2-overexpressing cancer cells. Furthermore, Snail2 interacted with G9a and histone deacetylases (HDACs) to form a complex to suppress E-cadherin transcription. Snail2 overexpression enhanced migration and invasion in HCC cells, whereas G9a and HDAC inhibition significantly reversed this effect. Moreover, Snail2 overexpression in cancer cells increased tumor metastasis and shortened survival time in mice, whereas G9a and HDAC inhibitors extended survival. Our study not only reveals a critical mechanism underlying the epigenetic regulation of EMT but also suggests novel treatment strategies for HCC.",Cancer Sci.,2019,"['Hu Y', 'Zheng Y', 'Dai M', 'Wang X', 'Wu J', 'Yu B', 'Zhang H', 'Cui Y', 'Kong W', 'Wu H', 'Yu X']",
31432232,The enhancement of glycolysis regulates pancreatic cancer metastasis.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is prone to distant metastasis and is expected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related death. In an extremely nutrient-deficient and hypoxic environment resulting from uncontrolled growth, vascular disturbances and desmoplastic reactions, pancreatic cancer cells utilize ""metabolic reprogramming"" to satisfy their energy demand and support malignant behaviors such as metastasis. Notably, pancreatic cancer cells show extensive enhancement of glycolysis, including glycolytic enzyme overexpression and increased lactate production, and this is caused by mitochondrial dysfunction, cancer driver genes, specific transcription factors, a hypoxic tumor microenvironment and stromal cells, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts and tumor-associated macrophages. The metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis in pancreatic cancer cells regulates the invasion-metastasis cascade by promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition, tumor angiogenesis and the metastatic colonization of distant organs. In addition to aerobic glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation also plays a critical role in pancreatic cancer metastasis in ways that remain unclear. In this review, we expound on the intracellular and extracellular causes of the enhancement of glycolysis in pancreatic cancer and the strong association between glycolysis and cancer metastasis, which we expect will yield new therapeutic approaches targeting cancer metabolism.",Cell.

31430760,Epidermal Growth Factor Potentiates Migration of MDA-MB 231 Breast Cancer Cells by Increasing NaV1.5 Channel Expression.,"INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and is the result of dysregulation of various signaling pathways in mammary epithelial cells. The mortality rate in patients suffering from breast cancer is high because the tumor cells have a prominent invasive capacity towards the surrounding tissues. Previous studies carried out in tumor cell models show that voltage-gated ion channels may be important molecular actors that contribute to the migratory and invasive capacity of the tumor cells.
METHODS: In this study, by using an experimental strategy that combines cell and molecular biology assays with electrophysiological recording, we sought to determine whether the voltage-dependent sodium channel NaV1.5 regulates the migratory capacity of the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB 231, when cells are maintained in the presence of epidermal growth factor (EGF), as an inductor of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition.
RESULTS: Our data show that EGF stimulates the migratory capacity of MDA-MB 231 cells, by regulating the functional expression of NaV1.5 channels. Consistent with this, the stimulatory actions of the growth factor were prevented by the use of tetrodotoxin, an Na+ channel selective blocker, as well as by resveratrol, an antioxidant that can also affect Na+ channel activity.
DISCUSSION: The understanding of molecular mechanisms, such as the EGF pathway in the progression of breast cancer is fundamental for the design of more effective therapeutic strategies for the disease.",Oncology,2019,"['González-González L', 'González-Ramírez R', 'Flores A', 'Avelino-Cruz JE', 'Felix R', 'Monjaraz E']",
31430455,Cancer stem cell (CSC) resistance drivers.,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a population of self-renewal cells with high tumorigenic potency. CSCs can adopt easily with changes in the nearby milieu, and are more resistant to conventional therapies than other cells within a tumor. CSC resistance can be induced secondary to radio- and chemotherapy, or even after chemotherapy secession. A combination of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors is contributed to CSC-mediated therapy resistance. CSCs represent protective autophagy and efficient cell cycling, along with highly qualified epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulators, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers, drug transporters, and anti-apoptotic and DNA repairing systems. In addition, CSCs develop cross-talking and share some characteristics with other cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) being more intense in higher stage tumors, and thereby sophisticating tumor-targeted therapies. TME, in fact, is a nest for aggravating resistance mechanisms in CSCs. TME is exposed constantly to the nutritional, metabolic and oxygen deprivation; these conditions promote CSC adaptation. This review is aimed to discuss main (intrinsic and extrinsic) mechanisms of CSC resistance and suggest some strategies to revoke this important promoter of therapy failure.",Life Sci.,2019,"['Najafi M', 'Mortezaee K', 'Majidpoor J']",

Here, an investigation of the anti-cancer activity of GTN and the molecular signaling pathways of non-apoptotic cell death in the invasive human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell line were undertaken. Apoptotic cell death was suppressed by using a pan-caspase inhibitor (Benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-[O-methyl]-fluoromethylketone), z-VAD-fmk) as a model to study whether GTN induced caspase-independent cell death. In the anoikis study, MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured on poly-(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)- or poly-HEMA- coated plates to mimic anoikis-resistance growth and determine whether GTN induced cell death and the mechanisms involved.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of FLVCR1-AS1 in ovarian serous cancer (OSC).
METHODS: FLVCR1-AS1 expression was determined in human OSC tissues, serums and cell lines. The role of FLVCR1-AS1 knockdown or overexpression on OSC cell growth, migration, invasion, apoptosis and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) were evaluated in vitro using CCK8, colony formation assay, wound healing assay, transwell assay and western blot assay. Besides, luciferase reporter assays were performed to identify interactions among FLVCR1-AS1 and its target genes. Moreover, the in vivo effects were investigated using immunocompromised NSG female mice.
RESULTS: In this study, FLVCR1-AS1 expression was upregulated in OSC tissues, serums, and cells. Knockdown FLVCR1-AS1 decreased cell growth, migration, invasion, and EMT, as well as increased apoptosis in OSC cells, whereas, overexpression of FLVCR1-AS1 increased cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT, and decreased apoptosis of OSC cells. Besides, FLVCR1-AS1 directly bound to miR-513 and downregulated its expression. Moreover, FLVCR1-AS1 reversed the effect of miR-513 on the OSC cell growth, which might be associated with the role of YAP1. Furthermore, in terms of mechanism, FLVCR1-AS1 promoted EMT in OSC cells. Finally, mice models further confirmed that knockdown FLVCR1-AS1 distinctly suppressed cell growth and EMT in vivo.

31411358,Membrane-initiated estrogen signaling in prostate cancer: A route to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.,"The plasma membrane (PM) is considered as a major druggable site. More than 50% of the existing drugs target PM proteins. In the wake of emerging data indicating a key role of estrogens in prostate cancer (PCa) pathogenesis, the study was undertaken to explore whether the estrogen binding sites exist on the PM and if such sites are functionally relevant in PCa. Estradiol (E2) binding to the PM was detected in androgen-dependent (LNCaP), androgen-independent (PC3, DU145) PCa cell lines, nontumorigenic (RWPE1) prostate epithelial cell line, and rat prostate cells. Conventional estrogen receptors (nuclear estrogen receptors), known for their nuclear localization, were detected in the PM enriched extracts. This was indirectly confirmed by reduced localization of ERs on the PM of cells, silenced for the expression of their cognate genes. Further, unlike cell-permeable E2, stimulation with cell-impermeable estradiol (E2-BSA) did not induce proliferation in LNCaP cells. However, stimulation with E2-BSA led to alterations in the phosphorylation status of several kinases including GSK3 and AKT, along with the hyperphosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins such as β-actin and cytokeratin 8 in LNCaP. This was accompanied by epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) features such as increased migration and invasion; higher vimentin expression, and a concomitant decrease in the E-cadherin expression. These effects were not observed in RWPE1 cells. Interestingly, cell-permeable E2 failed to induce EMT in PCa cells. This in vitro study is the first to suggest that the PM-initiated estrogen signaling contributes to higher invasiveness in PCa cells. Plasma membrane ERs may act as novel targets for PCa therapeutics.",Mol. Carcinog.,2019,"['Gadkar S', 'Nair S', 'Patil S', 'Kalamani S', 'Bandivdekar A', 'Patel V', 'Chaudhari U', 'Sachdeva G']",

CASC15 co-expressing genes were explored in the Cancer Genome Atlas Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma dataset. Putative co-expressing genes were analyzed by Gene Ontology and biological pathway enrichment analysis. CASC15 overexpression or knockdown and TWIST1 overexpression or knockdown in HCC cells was achieved by lentiviral transduction or plasmid transfection. Interaction between CASC15 and microRNA-33a-5p (miR-33a-5p) was verified by argonaute 2-RNA Immunoprecipitation (AGO2-RIP) and luciferase reporter assays. HCC cell malignancy was determined by cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion assays. Tumorigenicity was evaluated by xenograft assay. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of HCC cells was assessed by Western blot. TWIST1, sex-determining region Y-related high-mobility group box 4 (Sox4) and Versican were found as putative CASC15 co-expressing genes. CASC15 positively regulated TWIST1 gene expression as well as protein level of Sox4 and Versican in HCC cells. Positive correlation in expression between CASC15 and TWIST1 mRNA was verified in 42 pairs of HCC pathologic and adjacent tissue specimens.

31399111,TET1-mediated DNA hydroxymethylation activates inhibitors of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway to suppress EMT in pancreatic tumor cells.,"BACKGROUND: Ten-eleven translocation 1 (TET1) is a dioxygenase that converts 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) to induce DNA demethylation. TET1 has been reported to be absent in cancers, and to influence various oncogenes and anti-oncogenes. However the function of TET1 in pancreatic tumor remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of TET1 in the progression of pancreatic tumor and its mechanism of tumor suppression.
METHODS: Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), immunohistochemical (IHC) staining and dot blot were performed to detect the TET1 and 5-hmC expression in pancreatic tumor tissues and its adjacent non-tumor tissues. The clinical parameters significance of pancreatic tumor tissues was determined statistically. TET1 over-expression and knock-out cell lines were built and confirmed in vitro. Cell proliferation assay, wound-healing assays, transwell migration assay and nude mice model of orthotopic pancreatic cancer implantation were performed to assess the function of TET1 in pancreatic tumor. Western blot, qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence (IF), bisulfate sequencing (BSP), Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) were used to uncover the mechanism.
RESULTS: TET1 levels and 5-hmC content were downregulated in pancreatic tumor tissues and cell lines, and pancreatic tumor patients with low TET1 levels had a shorter overall survival than patients with high levels of TET1. TET1 suppressed pancreatic tumor proliferation and metastasis in vivo and in vitro. TET1 bound to the secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2) promoter and catalyzed demethylation to activate transcription of SFRP2, inhibiting both the canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways, and ultimately obstructing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in pancreatic tumors.

Our aims were to identify the molecule at the downstream of TWIST1 and to evaluate its potential as a diagnostic and a prognostic marker in NSCLC.
METHODS: The functional genes at the downstream of TWIST1 were obtained via microarray gene expression analyses in the NSCLC cell line. The expression levels of synaptotagmin 7 (SYT7) in a cohort of patients with NSCLC (n = 154) were examined using immunohistochemistry staining and assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression analysis. The effects of SYT7 on the tumorigenesis and metastasis of NSCLC were measured in NSCLC cells. In vivo xenograft lung cancer models were used to study the tumorigenesis role of SYT7.
FINDINGS: We discovered that SYT7 is significantly altered by TWIST1 expression. We further confirmed that SYT7 protein was significantly higher in NSCLC than that in the adjacent normal lung tissue, and higher SYT7 expression was associated with poor survival of NSCLC patients. The protein level of SYT7 was positively correlated with TWIST1 in NSCLC tissue. Functional experiments indicated that SYT7 promoted proliferation, invasion, and metastasis and inhibited cell apoptosis of NSCLC cells in vitro. In vivo experiments showed that shSYT7 inhibited the xenograft tumor growth of NSCLC cells. Knocking down of SYT7 increased the expression of E-cadherin and decreased the level of N-cadherin and Vimentin in cultured cells.

Here we show that monoallelic loss of ARID1A in the mouse endometrial epithelium is sufficient for vaginal bleeding when combined with PI3K activation. Sorted mutant epithelial cells display gene expression and promoter chromatin signatures associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We further show that ARID1A is bound to promoters with open chromatin, but ARID1A loss leads to increased promoter chromatin accessibility and the expression of EMT genes. PI3K activation partially rescues the mesenchymal phenotypes driven by ARID1A loss through antagonism of ARID1A target gene expression, resulting in partial EMT and invasion. We propose that ARID1A normally maintains endometrial epithelial cell identity by repressing mesenchymal cell fates, and that coexistent ARID1A and PI3K mutations promote epithelial transdifferentiation and collective invasion.

However, the mechanism of LAPTM4B regulation is not fully elucidated. Aberrant microRNAs (miRNAs) can regulate gene expression by interfering with target transcripts and/or translation to exert tumor-suppressive or oncogenic effects in breast cancer. In the present study, miR-132-3p, which was predicted by relevant software, was confirmed to directly bind to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of LAPTM4B and negatively regulate its expression in luciferase reporter and western blot assays. Subsequently, we validated that miR-132-3p was downregulated in breast cancer tissues. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that miR-132-3p had accurate diagnostic value, and a Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression model showed that miR-132-3p was a potential prognostic marker for recurrence, showing low levels in breast cancer patients. In addition, we showed that miR-132-3p was inversely correlated with LAPTM4B expression in the above samples. Functionally, miR-132-3p suppressed the migration and invasion of breast carcinoma cells through LAPTM4B by mediating epithelial-mesenchymal transition signals, and partially reversed the carcinogenic effects of LAPTM4B by inhibiting the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway. Taken together, these findings provide the first comprehensive analysis of miR-132-3p as a direct LAPTM4B-targeted miRNA, and shed light on miR-132-3p/LAPTM4B as a significant functional axis involved in the oncogenesis and metastasis of breast cancer.",Cancer Sci.,2019,"['Li S', 'Xu JJ', 'Zhang QY']",

The mechanism between ZBTB7A and breast cancer is not well understood, so further research is needed. In this study, we first investigated the expression of ZBTB7A in tissue samples of clinical breast cancer patients, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells. Second, we overexpressed the ZBTB7A in MCF-7 cells and silenced the ZBTB7A in MDA-MB-231 cells using lentivirus transfection technology, respectively, and verified the effect of ZBTB7A on migration and invasion of breast cancer cell lines through in vitro cell function experiments, such as wound-healing assay, migration and invasion assay, quantitative real time reverse transcriptase (qRT-PCR) and western blot. Then, the correlation between the above influences, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and NF-κB was analysed. Finally, in vivo tumour transplantation model in nude mice was established to verified the effect of ZBTB7A on metastasis of breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. In conclusion, ZBTB7A is highly expressed in cancer tissue, breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7.

31373074,Gemcitabine-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition-like changes sustain chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer cells of mesenchymal-like phenotype.,"Growing body of evidence suggests that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical process in tumor progression and chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer (PC). The aim of this study was to analyze the role of EMT-like changes in acquisition of resistance to gemcitabine in pancreatic cells of the mesenchymal or epithelial phenotype. Therefore, chemoresistant BxPC-3, Capan-2, Panc-1, and MiaPaca-2 cells were selected by chronic exposure to increasing concentrations of gemcitabine. We show that gemcitabine-resistant Panc-1 and MiaPaca-2 cells of mesenchymal-like phenotype undergo further EMT-like molecular changes mediated by ERK-ZEB-1 pathway, and that inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation or ZEB-1 expression resulted in a decrease in chemoresistance. Conversely, gemcitabine-resistant BxPC-3 and Capan-2 cells of epithelial-like phenotype did not show such typical EMT-like molecular changes although the expression of the tight junction marker occludin could be found decreased. In pancreatic cancer patients, high ZEB-1 expression was associated with tumor invasion and tumor budding. In addition, tumor budding was essentially observed in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. These findings support the notion that gemcitabine treatment induces EMT-like changes that sustain invasion and chemoresistance in PC cells.",Mol.

31370857,RUNX1 promotes tumour metastasis by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway and EMT in colorectal cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) plays the roles of an oncogene and an anti-oncogene in epithelial tumours, and abnormally elevated RUNX1 has been suggested to contribute to the carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the mechanism remains unclear.
METHODS: The expression of RUNX1 in CRC and normal tissues was detected by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting. The effect of RUNX1 on CRC migration and invasion was conducted by functional experiments in vitro and in vivo. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation assay verified the direct regulation of RUNX1 on the promoter of the KIT, which leads to the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.
RESULTS: RUNX1 expression is upregulated in CRC tissues. Upregulated RUNX1 promotes cell metastasis and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of CRC both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, RUNX1 can activate Wnt/β-catenin signalling in CRC cells by directly interacting with β-catenin and targeting the promoter and enhancer regions of KIT to promote KIT transcription. These observations demonstrate that RUNX1 upregulation is a common event in CRC specimens and is closely correlated with cancer metastasis and that RUNX1 promotes EMT of CRC cells by activating Wnt/β-catenin signalling. Moreover, RUNX1 is regulated by Wnt/β-catenin.
CONCLUSION: Our findings first demonstrate that RUNX1 promotes CRC metastasis by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway and EMT.",J. Exp. Clin.

In fact, occurrence of chemo-resistance still remains a daunting hindrance to effectiveness of the current approach to GC therapy. There is accumulating evidence that a plethora of cellular and molecular factors is implicated in drug-induced phenotypical switching of GC cells. Among them, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), autophagy, drug detoxification, DNA damage response and drug target alterations, have been reported as major determinants. Intriguingly, resistant GC phenotype may be the result of GC cell-induced tumor microenvironment (TME) remodeling, which is currently emerging as a key player in promoting drug resistance and overcoming cytotoxic effects of drugs.

31368817,Luteolin exhibits anti-breast cancer property through up-regulating miR-203.,"Luteolin is a representative of natural flavonoid that has anti-tumour properties. This study designed to check its impact on breast cancer and the underlying mechanisms. MDA-MB-453 and MCF-7 cells were administrated with luteolin and the following techniques were carried out: CCK-8 assay, FITC-PI double-staining and Western blot. qRT-PCR analysis was utilized to see the effects of luteolin on miR-203 expression. Besides, miR-203 expression was silenced by transfection with specific inhibitor. Luteolin remarkably declined MDA-MB-453 and MCF-7 cells viability and accelerated apoptosis which accompanied by Bax up-regulation, Bcl-2 down-regulation and Caspase-3 cleavage. Also, luteolin impeded TGFβ1-induced EMT, as evidenced by the decreased levels of Vimentin, Zeb1 and N-cadherin, as well as the increased level of E-cadherin. miR-203 was highly expressed in 22 pair of breast cancer tissues than the matched paracancerous tissues. Luteolin could elevate miR-203 level. Besides, luteolin's anti-tumour effects were partially eliminated by miR-203 silence. Further, luteolin inhibited Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signalling, while the inhibitory effects were flattened by miR-203 silence. Luteolin significantly reduced breast cancer cells growth and EMT. Luteolin exerted its anti-tumour effects possibly involved the elevated expression of miR-203 and the inhibited Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signalling.",Artif Cells Nanomed Biotechnol,2019,"['Gao G', 'Ge R', 'Li Y', 'Liu S']",
31367836,Possible correlation of sonic hedgehog signaling with epithelial-mesenchymal transition in muscle-invasive bladder cancer progression.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the role of sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in bladder cancer progression and invasion.
METHODS: We cultured three bladder cancer cell lines, muscle-invasive T24 and 5637, and non-muscle-invasive KK47, in the presence of a recombinant-Shh (r-Shh) protein or cyclopamine, a Shh signaling inhibitor, to investigate proliferation and expression of EMT markers. Wound-healing assays and transwell assay were performed to evaluate cell invasion and migration. Mice were then inoculated with bladder cancer cells and treated with cyclopamine. Mouse tumor samples were stained for Shh signaling and EMT markers.
RESULTS: R-Shh protein enhanced cell proliferation, whereas cyclopamine significantly suppressed cell proliferation, especially in invasive cancer (5637 and T24) (p < 0.05). R-Shh protein promoted EMT, suppressed E-cadherin and enhanced N-cadherin and vimentin and Gli1, an Shh downstream molecule, while cyclopamine blocked EMT, especially in 5637 and T24. Cyclopamine also inhibited cell invasion and migration in vitro. In the animal study, intraperitoneal injection of cyclopamine significantly suppressed tumor growth in 5637 and T24 in mice (p = 0.01 and p = 0.004, respectively) and slightly suppressing KK47 tumor growth (p = 0.298). Significant cyclopamine-induced suppression of Gli1 in 5637 and T24 mouse tumors (both p = 0.03) was seen, suggesting that muscle-invasive bladder cancer may be more dependent on Shh signaling than non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Shh signaling and EMT were especially enhanced in muscle-invasive bladder cancer progression and invasion, and suppressed by the inhibition of Shh signaling.",J. Cancer Res. Clin.

The clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic relevance of NSCs was investigated in gallbladder cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Specimens were obtained from 62 patients with gallbladder cancer who underwent surgery. The emergence of NSCs and their correlation with clinicopathological factors, prognosis, and EMT markers was evaluated.
RESULTS: The NSC grade correlated with tumor size, preoperative CA19-9, surgical margin, the degree of differentiation, the depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, lymphatic invasion, vascular invasion, and perineural invasion. Multivariate analysis of overall survival showed that NSCs were an independent prognostic factor. A correlation between NSCs and EMT was also suggested.

31366361,Claudin-low-like mouse mammary tumors show distinct transcriptomic patterns uncoupled from genomic drivers.,"BACKGROUND: Claudin-low breast cancer is a molecular subtype associated with poor prognosis and without targeted treatment options. The claudin-low subtype is defined by certain biological characteristics, some of which may be clinically actionable, such as high immunogenicity. In mice, the medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary tumor model yields a heterogeneous set of tumors, a subset of which display claudin-low features. Neither the genomic characteristics of MPA/DMBA-induced claudin-low tumors nor those of human claudin-low breast tumors have been thoroughly explored.
METHODS: The transcriptomic characteristics and subtypes of MPA/DMBA-induced mouse mammary tumors were determined using gene expression microarrays. Somatic mutations and copy number aberrations in MPA/DMBA-induced tumors were identified from whole exome sequencing data. A publicly available dataset was queried to explore the genomic characteristics of human claudin-low breast cancer and to validate findings in the murine tumors.
RESULTS: Half of MPA/DMBA-induced tumors showed a claudin-low-like subtype. All tumors carried mutations in known driver genes. While the specific genes carrying mutations varied between tumors, there was a consistent mutational signature with an overweight of T>A transversions in TG dinucleotides. Most tumors carried copy number aberrations with a potential oncogenic driver effect. Overall, several genomic events were observed recurrently; however, none accurately delineated claudin-low-like tumors. Human claudin-low breast cancers carried a distinct set of genomic characteristics, in particular a relatively low burden of mutations and copy number aberrations. The gene expression characteristics of claudin-low-like MPA/DMBA-induced tumors accurately reflected those of human claudin-low tumors, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype, high level of immune activation, and low degree of differentiation. There was an elevated expression of the immunosuppressive genes PTGS2 (encoding COX-2) and CD274 (encoding PD-L1) in human and murine claudin-low tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that the claudin-low breast cancer subtype is not demarcated by specific genomic aberrations, but carries potentially targetable characteristics warranting further research.",Breast Cancer Res.,2019,"['Fougner C', 'Bergholtz H', 'Kuiper R', 'Norum JH', 'Sørlie T']",
31364750,Overexpression of CPXM2 predicts an unfavorable prognosis and promotes the proliferation and migration of gastric cancer.,"Carboxypeptidase X, M14 family member 2 (CPXM2), has been associated with several human disorders such as developmental diseases. However, whether CPXM2 is involved in oncogenesis or tumor progression remains unclear. In the present study, we used clinical samples from gastric cancer (GC) patients to investigate potential roles of CPXM2 in GC. We also analyzed datasets from the Oncomine database, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the Kaplan‑Meier Plotter to validate these results. We found that CPXM2 was overexpressed in GC and that the overexpression was associated with an unfavorable prognosis, regardless of the Lauren classification and tumor node metastasis staging. In addition, knockdown of CPXM2 in cultured GC cells significantly impeded cell proliferation and migration, as indicated by the cholecystokinin octapeptide, colony formation assay, scratch wound healing assay, and Transwell® migration assay. Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis using RNA‑seq data from TCGA indicated that high CPXM2 expression in GC patients was positively correlated with the HALLMARK_APICAL_JUNCTION and HALLMARK_EPITHELIAL_MESENCHYMAL_TRANSITION gene sets. Finally, western blotting results revealed that several key molecules involved in the epithelial mesenchymal transition were regulated by CPXM2. Taken together, these results imply an active role for CPXM2 in promoting tumor aggressiveness via epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) modulation in GCs.",Oncol.

31364745,Upregulation of JMJD2A promotes migration and invasion in bladder cancer through regulation of SLUG.,"Jumonji domain‑containing protein 2A (JMJD2A) has been identified to promote cell proliferation in bladder cancer; however, it remains undetermined whether JMJD2A regulates cell migration and invasion in bladder cancer. The aim of the present study was to further investigate the roles of JMJD2A in bladder cancer. The expression levels of JMJD2A in bladder cancer tissues and cell lines were established by RT‑qPCR assays and western blot analysis. Moreover, by gain‑ and loss‑of‑function assays, the effects of JMJD2A on migration and invasion as well as proliferation were investigated in bladder cancer cells. The results revealed that the expression level of JMJD2A was significantly upregulated in bladder cancer tissues and cell lines compared to adjacent non‑tumor tissues and a human immortalized bladder urothelial cell line. Kaplan‑Meier survival analysis indicated that patients with high JMJD2A expression level had shorter overall survival. Moreover, JMJD2A could promote cell migration and invasion by facilitating epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) in bladder cancer. In addition, it was determined that JMJD2A promoted EMT through regulation of SLUG expression. Collectively, our findings revealed that JMJD2A may act as an oncogene and participate in bladder cancer progression, which provides a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with bladder cancer.",Oncol.

31364741,Transcriptional regulation of FoxM1 by HIF‑1α mediates hypoxia‑induced EMT in prostate cancer.,"Hypoxia is a tumorigenesis‑related microenvironment change which usually occurs in the earliest stage of prostate cancer (PCa) development. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that hypoxia/hypoxia‑inducing factor (HIF) is involved in the induction of epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increased metastatic potential in PCa. However, the mechanism by which hypoxia/HIF regulates EMT remains unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated the molecular mechanisms of hypoxia‑induced EMT in PCa, focusing on HIF‑1α/Forkhead box M1 (FoxM1) signaling pathway. PCa PC3 and DU145 cell lines were used as the model system in vitro. Our data revealed that hypoxia induced EMT in PCa cells. Bioinformatics analysis identified the possible association between HIF‑1α and FoxM1. Additionally, FoxM1 was significantly associated with PCa development and Gleason scores of PCa. Exposure to hypoxia resulted in the increased expression of HIF‑1α and FoxM1. Genetic knockdown FoxM1 abolished hypoxia‑induced EMT in PCa, while exogenous overexpression of FoxM1 facilitated hypoxia‑induced EMT. Furthermore, the increase of FoxM1 during hypoxia was due to the transcriptional regulation on the FoxM1 promoter by HIF‑1α. We also confirmed the binding site of HIF‑1α on the FoxM1 promoter by different lengths promoter sequences. These findings provide new insights into how EMT is regulated in PCa under hypoxic stress. It is worthwhile to investigate in future that inhibition of FoxM1 as a potential target may be an effective therapeutic strategy against PCa.",Oncol.

31364732,HMQ‑T‑F2 suppresses migration of the human cervical cancer HeLa cells by reversing EMT via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.,"Epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) is closely related to tumor metastasis, and offers insight into novel strategies for cancer treatment. HMQ‑T‑F2 (F2) is a taspine derivative, which has excellent anticancer activity in human cervical cancer. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of F2 on in vitro migration of HeLa cells. The present data demonstrated that F2 inhibited migration of HeLa cells by negatively regulating the Wnt signaling pathway and reversing EMT. F2 not only mediated Frizzled8, p‑LRP6 and LRP6 expression, but also downregulated the phosphorylation of GSK3β, and concurrently decreased the nucleus protein expression of MMP2, MMP3, MMP7, MMP9, and c‑Myc. In addition, the expression of N‑cadherin, vimentin, Snail and HIF‑1α were downregulated and that of E‑cadherin was upregulated after F2 treatment. F2 was also associated with the downregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways. Notably, F2 induced HeLa cell accumulation at the S phase and cell apoptosis. These results provide evidence that F2 inhibits HeLa cell migration, proliferation and promotes apoptosis. It also reverses EMT, potentially via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Therefore, F2 may be a potential therapeutic reagent against cervical cancer.",Oncol. Rep.,2019,"['Dai B', 'Yu R', 'Fan M', 'Yang T', 'Wang B', 'Zhang Y']",
31358901,RBM47-regulated alternative splicing of TJP1 promotes actin stress fiber assembly during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.,"Morphological and functional changes in cells during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process are known to be regulated by alternative splicing. However, only a few splicing factors involved in EMT have been reported and their underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we showed that an isoform of tight junction protein 1 (TJP1) lacking exon 20 (TJP1-α-) is predominantly expressed in tumor tissues and in A549 cells during transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-induced EMT. RBM47 promoted the inclusion of exon 20 of TJP1, the alternative exon encoding the α-domain, by which RBM47 recognizes to (U)GCAUG in the downstream intronic region of exon 20. We also found that the first RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain of RBM47 is critical in the regulation of alternative splicing and its recognition to pre-mRNA of TJP1. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the TJP1-α- isoform enhances the assembly of actin stress fibers, thereby promoting cellular migration in a wound healing assay. Our results suggest the regulatory mechanism for the alternative splicing of TJP1 pre-mRNA by RBM47 during EMT, providing a basis for studies related to the modulation of EMT via alternative splicing.",Oncogene,2019,"['Kim YE', 'Won M', 'Lee SG', 'Park C', 'Song CH', 'Kim KK']",
31357383,Tumor-Derived Exosomes Mediate the Instability of Cadherins and Promote Tumor Progression.,"Cadherins, including E-cadherin, N-cadherin, VE-cadherin, etc., are important adhesion molecules mediating intercellular junctions. The abnormal expression of cadherins is often associated with tumor development and progression. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is the most important step in the metastasis cascade and is accompanied by altered expression of cadherins. Recent studies reveal that as a cargo for intercellular communication, exosomes-one type of extracellular vesicles that can be secreted by tumor cells-are involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes, especially in tumor metastasis. Tumor-derived exosomes play a crucial role in mediating the cadherin instability in recipient cells by transferring bioactive molecules (oncogenic microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), EMT-related proteins, and others), modulating their local and distant microenvironment, and facilitating cancer metastasis. In turn, aberrant expression of cadherins in carcinoma cells can also affect the biogenesis and release of exosomes. Therefore, we summarize the current research on the crosstalk between tumor-derived exosomes and aberrant cadherin signals to reveal the unique role of exosomes in cancer progression.",Int J Mol Sci,2019,"['Wang B', 'Tan Z', 'Guan F']",
31356589,The impact of DNA methylation on the cancer proteome.,"Aberrant DNA methylation disrupts normal gene expression in cancer and broadly contributes to oncogenesis. We previously developed MethylMix, a model-based algorithmic approach to identify epigenetically regulated driver genes. MethylMix identifies genes where methylation likely executes a functional role by using transcriptomic data to select only methylation events that can be linked to changes in gene expression. However, given that proteins more closely link genotype to phenotype recent high-throughput proteomic data provides an opportunity to more accurately identify functionally relevant abnormal methylation events. Here we present a MethylMix analysis that refines nominations for epigenetic driver genes by leveraging quantitative high-throughput proteomic data to select only genes where DNA methylation is predictive of protein abundance. Applying our algorithm across three cancer cohorts we find that using protein abundance data narrows candidate nominations, where the effect of DNA methylation is often buffered at the protein level. Next, we find that MethylMix genes predictive of protein abundance are enriched for biological processes involved in cancer including functions involved in epithelial and mesenchymal transition. Moreover, our results are also enriched for tumor markers which are predictive of clinical features like tumor stage and we find clustering using MethylMix genes predictive of protein abundance captures cancer subtypes.",PLoS Comput.

However, the expression patterns and prognostic values of HNRNPs in pancreatic cancer (PC) are lacking. In this study, several public databases were explored to identify the commonly upregulated HNRNPs in PC. The clinical significance of HNRNPL (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins L) in PC was analyzed. We further performed a series of experiments to elucidate the biological functions of HNRNPL. Bioinformatics analysis including pathway enrichment and interactors with HNRNPL was used to explain the potential mechanisms of HNRNPL in PC pathogenesis. Herein, we reported that HNRNPL was commonly overexpressed in public databases and that high expression of HNRNPL in PC was positively associated with aggressive disease and poor overall survival. Downregulation of HNRNPL suppressed the abilities of migration and epithelial mesenchymal transition of PC cells in vitro, while depletion of HNRNPL did not affect the proliferation rate of PC cells. We further showed that HNRNPL might combine with RNA-binding protein, PTBP1, and function as a part of the spliceosome to regulate alternative splicing of target genes in the occurrence and development of PC. HNRNPL could be employed as an innovative prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for PC.",Biomed Res Int,2019,"['Qiao L', 'Xie N', 'Bai Y', 'Li Y', 'Shi Y', 'Wang J', 'Liu N']",

But, the influences of hsa_circ_0007059 in lung cancer remain obscure. Expression of hsa_circ_0007059 in lung cancer tissues was firstly determined through RT-qPCR. After overexpressing hsa_circ_0007059, cell viability, apoptosis, p53/CyclinD1, Bax and Pro/Cleaved-Caspase-3 and EMT-correlative factors (E-cadherin, Vimetin, Twist1 and Zeb1) were tested in A549 and H1975 cells. MiR-378 expression in lung cancer tissues and cells was evaluated after miR-378 mimic transfection. Wnt/β-catenin and ERK1/2 pathways were finally evaluated in A549 and H1975 cells. Inhibition of hsa_circ_0007059 was discovered in lung cancer tissues. Overexpressed hsa_circ_0007059 evidently restrained cell proliferation, elevated p53 and repressed CyclinD1 expression, meanwhile triggered apoptosis and enhanced Bax and Cleaved-Caspase-3 expression. Increased hsa_circ_0007059 abated EMT via enhancement of E-cadherin and inhibition of Vimentin, Twist and Zeb1 in A549 and H1975 cells. MiR-378 was up-regulated in lung cancer tissues, declined by hsa_circ_0007059 overexpression in A549 and H1975 cells. Overexpressed hsa_circ_0007059 hindered Wnt/β-catenin and ERK1/2 pathways via suppressing miR-378 in A549 and H1975 cells.

31351450,microRNA-21 promotes breast cancer proliferation and metastasis by targeting LZTFL1.,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common cancer type in female. As microRNAs play vital role in breast cancer, this study aimed to explore the molecular mechanism and clinical value of miR-21 in breast cancer.
METHODS: qRT-PCR was performed to detect miR-21 levels in plasma of 127 healthy controls, 82 benign breast tumor, 252 breast cancer patients, as well as in breast cancer cell lines. Transwell and wound healing assay were used to analyze breast cancer metastasis in response to miR-21 inhibitor. Colony formation and eFluor™ 670 based flow cytometric analysis were used to test breast cancer proliferation following miR-21 inhibitor treatment. Leucine zipper transcription factor-like 1 (LZTFL1), the target gene of miR-21 was predicted by MIRDB, TargetScan 5.1, PicTar and miRanda. Survival analysis of LZTFL1 levels in breast cancer prognosis was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method by log-rank test according to data from the Cancer Genome Atlas. Luciferase activity assay was performed to confirm the regulation of miR-21 on LZTFL1. LZTFL1 siRNA and miR-21 inhibitor were co-transfected to breast cancer cells, then cell proliferation, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) makers were tested. BALB/c nude mice were injected in situ with Hs578T cells stably overexpressing miR-21. Breast tumor growth, metastasis and the expression of EMT markers or LZTFL1 were detected in vivo.
RESULTS: Plasma miR-21 levels were elevated in breast cancer patients compared with healthy controls and benign breast tumor patients, and the miR-21 levels were significantly decreased after surgery comparing with pre operation in 44 patients. Inhibition of miR-21 suppressed cell proliferation and metastasis in breast cancer cells. LZTFL1 was identified as a novel target gene of miR-21. Knockdown of LZTFL1 overcame the suppression of miR-21 inhibitor on cell proliferation, metastasis and the expression of EMT markers in breast cancer cells. miR-21 overexpression promoted breast cancer cell proliferation and metastasis in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that plasma miR-21 level is a crucial biomarker for breast cancer diagnosis and targeting miR-21-LZTFL1-EMT axis might be a promising strategy in breast cancer therapy.

31340433,"LOXL3 Function Beyond Amino Oxidase and Role in Pathologies, Including Cancer.","Lysyl oxidase like 3 (LOXL3) is a copper-dependent amine oxidase responsible for the crosslinking of collagen and elastin in the extracellular matrix. LOXL3 belongs to a family including other members: LOX, LOXL1, LOXL2, and LOXL4. Autosomal recessive mutations are rare and described in patients with Stickler syndrome, early-onset myopia and non-syndromic cleft palate. Along with an essential function in embryonic development, multiple biological functions have been attributed to LOXL3 in various pathologies related to amino oxidase activity. Additionally, various novel roles have been described for LOXL3, such as the oxidation of fibronectin in myotendinous junction formation, and of deacetylation and deacetylimination activities of STAT3 to control of inflammatory response. In tumors, three distinct roles were described: (1) LOXL3 interacts with SNAIL and contributes to proliferation and metastasis by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells; (2) LOXL3 is localized predominantly in the nucleus associated with invasion and poor gastric cancer prognosis; (3) LOXL3 interacts with proteins involved in DNA stability and mitosis completion, contributing to melanoma progression and sustained proliferation.

31338937,c-Myb promotes growth and metastasis of colorectal cancer through c-fos-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition.,"c-Myb is a crucial transcription factor that participates in various biological functions; however, its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains poorly investigated. We first analyzed the expression and clinical significance of c-Myb in a retrospective cohort enrolling 132 CRC patients. Then, the CRISPR/Cas9 technique was used to establish c-Myb gene KO CRC cell lines. Cellular functional assays in vitro and in vivo were used to evaluate the impact of c-Myb KO in CRC cells. Finally, RNA sequencing was used to investigate the potential oncogenic mechanisms regulated by c-Myb in CRC progression and related cellular validations were accordingly carried out. As a result, c-Myb is significantly overexpressed in CRC tissues as compared with adjacent normal tissues. High expression of c-Myb is positively correlated with lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis. Univariate analysis and multivariate analysis further identify c-Myb as an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for CRC patients. c-Myb KO inhibits the proliferation, apoptosis resistance, invasion, metastasis, colony formation and in vivo tumorigenesis of CRC cells. Also, the mechanism investigation indicates that c-Myb may promote CRC progression by regulating c-fos. c-fos overexpression can rescue the inhibitory effect of c-Myb KO on the malignant characteristics of CRC cells. Finally, we find that c-Myb KO inhibits the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) molecular phenotype in CRC cells, whereas c-fos overexpression can rescue this inhibitory effect. This study suggests that c-Myb promotes the malignant progression of CRC through c-fos-induced EMT and has the potential to be a promising prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target.",Cancer Sci.,2019,"['Qu X', 'Yan X', 'Kong C', 'Zhu Y', 'Li H', 'Pan D', 'Zhang X', 'Liu Y', 'Yin F', 'Qin H']",

Despite the progress in cancer research and the comprehension of tumorigenesis mechanisms, cancer remains a major issue in public health. A better understanding of the molecular factors associated with the appearance or progression of cancer may allow the development of therapeutic alternatives. Increasing data highlight the role of long non-coding RNAs in many diseases, including cancer. The long non-coding RNA H19 was the first discovered riboregulator, and it has been shown to be involved at multiple steps of tumorigenesis. Indeed, this lncRNA exert its action at various molecular scales. Understanding the role of H19 in cancer progression may allow to set up therapeutic strategies to prevent tumor expansion and metastatic dissemination. In this review, we will summarize the overexpression of the long non-coding RNA H19 in several types of cancer and the multiple implications of the long non-coding RNA H19 in the different hallmarks that define human cancer.",Cell.

31336560,Cell Type-Specific TGF-β Mediated EMT in 3D and 2D Models and Its Reversal by TGF-β Receptor Kinase Inhibitor in Ovarian Cancer Cell Lines.,"Transcriptome profiling of 3D models compared to 2D models in various cancer cell lines shows differential expression of TGF-β-mediated and cell adhesion pathways. Presence of TGF-β in these cell lines shows an increased invasion potential which is specific to cell type. In the present study, we identified exogenous addition of TGF-β can induce Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in a few cancer cell lines. RNA sequencing and real time PCR were carried out in different ovarian cancer cell lines to identify molecular profiling and metabolic profiling. Since EMT induction by TGF-β is cell-type specific, we decided to select two promising ovarian cancer cell lines as model systems to study EMT. TGF-β modulation in EMT and cancer invasion were successfully depicted in both 2D and 3D models of SKOV3 and CAOV3 cell lines. Functional evaluation in 3D and 2D models demonstrates that the addition of the exogenous TGF-β can induce EMT and invasion in cancer cells by turning them into aggressive phenotypes. TGF-β receptor kinase I inhibitor (LY364947) can revert the TGF-β effect in these cells. In a nutshell, TGF-β can induce EMT and migration, increase aggressiveness, increase cell survival, alter cell characteristics, remodel the Extracellular Matrix (ECM) and increase cell metabolism favorable for tumor invasion and metastasis. We concluded that transcriptomic and phenotypic effect of TGF-β and its inhibitor is cell-type specific and not cancer specific.",Int J Mol Sci,2019,"['Al Ameri W', 'Ahmed I', 'Al-Dasim FM', 'Ali Mohamoud Y', 'Al-Azwani IK', 'Malek JA', 'Karedath T']",

31331328,The canonical TGF-β/Smad signalling pathway is involved in PD-L1-induced primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs in EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 30% of patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-activating mutations have no response to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (primary resistance). However, little is known about the molecular mechanism involved in primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) plays important regulatory roles in intracellular functions and leads to acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC. Here, we investigated the mechanistic role of PD-L1 in primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells.
METHODS: The expression levels of PD-L1 and the sensitivity to gefitinib in H1975, HCC827 and PC-9 cells were determined by quantitative real-time PCR analysis (qRT-PCR) and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays, respectively. Molecular manipulations (silencing or overexpression) were performed to assess the effect of PD-L1 on sensitivity to gefitinib, and a mouse xenograft model was used for in vivo confirmation. Western blotting and qRT-PCR were used to analyse the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. The effect of PD-L1 on migratory and invasive abilities was evaluated using the Transwell assay and mice tail intravenous injection.
RESULTS: Higher expression of PD-L1 was related to less sensitivity to gefitinib in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines. The overexpression or knockdown of PD-L1 presented diametrical sensitivity to gefitinib in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the overexpression of PD-L1 led to primary resistance to gefitinib through the induction of EMT, which was dependent on the upregulation of Smad3 phosphorylation. Moreover, in the mouse model, the knockdown of PD-L1 inhibited transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1-induced cell metastasis in vivo.
CONCLUSION: PD-L1 contributes to primary resistance to EGFR-TKI in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells, which may be mediated through the induction of EMT via the activation of the TGF-β/Smad canonical signalling pathway.",Respir.

31329925,Mesenchymal-epithelial transition gene amplification and protein overexpression in stage IV pulmonary adenocarcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), MET gene copy number gain, including gene amplification and chromosome 7 polysomy, is reportedly associated with patient prognosis. Although relationship between MET copy number gain and poor prognosis has been suggested in surgically resected non-small cell lung cancer, the clinical significance of MET copy number gain and protein overexpression in patients with advanced unresectable tumor is unclear.
METHODS: We assessed MET copy number gain and protein expression using fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in 88 patients with clinical stage IV pulmonary adenocarcinoma receiving chemotherapy, immunotherapy or palliative care.
RESULTS: We found MET amplification, polysomy 7 and high MET protein expression in 10.2, 18.2 and 62.5% of 88 cases, respectively. Gene amplification and high protein expression were not significantly associated. A univariate analysis showed that MET amplification-positive patients had increased overall survival (HR 0.335, 95% CI: 0.119-0.945; P = 0.0388). Although it was not statistically significant in the multivariate analysis of the whole cohort, with the removal of patients who did not receive any treatment other than palliative care, MET amplification independently improved the overall survival (HR 0.178, 95% CI: 0.041-0.770; P = 0.0209). Chromosome 7 polysomy and high MET protein expression did not affect the overall survival.

This study investigated the potential mechanism underlying the action of BHPF against endometrial cancer in vitro. We used the cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) method on Ishikawa cells to screen sub-lethal doses of BHPF and established the optimal concentration at which BHPF influenced the proliferation of Ishikawa cells. Effect of BHPF on cell migration and invasion was investigated by cell scratch assay and transwell assay, respectively. Expression levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins were detected by Western blot analysis. BHPF was found to inhibit the proliferation of Ishikawa cells, whose migration and invasion abilities were also reduced. Western blot indicated that BHPF can significantly inhibit the EMT process of Ishikawa cells by blocking transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway. This is the first report of the effect of BHPF on the biological behavior of endometrial cancer cells and its inhibition of endometrial cancer progression by repressing both endometrial cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, hence suggesting it as a novel anti-cancer drug.

31324602,"Intergrated analysis of ELMO1, serves as a link between tumour mutation burden and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in hepatocellular carcinoma.","BACKGROUND: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is critical for cancer cell metastasis. Recently, EMT was reported to be associated with the inflammatory tumour microenvironment and, therefore, might be a predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint blockade agents. However, the underlying mechanism is still unclear.
METHODS: Patient survival data for our HCC cohort, TCGA and GEO datasets were determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The functional roles of ELMO1 in HCC were demonstrated by a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. Gene microarray analysis was used to demonstrate potential mechanisms of ELMO1. Data retrieved from the TCGA datasets were used to determine the relationships of ELMO1, EMT and TMB.
FINDINGS: Here, we report an indispensable role for ELMO1 in linking EMT with tumour mutation burden (TMB), which is a promising biomarker for the immune checkpoint blockade agent response. Upregulated ELMO1 expression is associated with a poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as well as increased cell growth, invasion, migration, angiogenesis and EMT in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that ELMO1 regulates SOX10 expression and induces EMT through PI3K/Akt signalling. Moreover, ELMO1 is negatively associated with TMB, indicating a negative relationship between EMT and TMB.
INTERPRETATION: ELMO1 serves as a link between EMT and TMB, providing a mechanistic basis for the further development of ELMO1 as a therapeutic target against HCC and potentially a promising biomarker of the immune checkpoint blockade agent response.

Although significant progress has been made in the characterization of multiple members of the cadherin superfamily, most of the published work continues to focus in the switch E-/N-cadherin and its role in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Here, we will discuss the structural and functional properties of a subset of cadherins (cadherin 17, cadherin 5 and cadherin 6) that have an RGD motif in the extracellular domains. This RGD motif is critical for the interaction with α2β1 integrin and posterior integrin pathway activation in cancer metastatic cells. However, other signaling pathways seem to be affected by RGD cadherin interactions, as will be discussed. The range of solid tumors with overexpression or ""de novo"" expression of one or more of these three cadherins is very wide (gastrointestinal, gynaecological and melanoma, among others), underscoring the relevance of these cadherins in cancer metastasis. Finally, we will discuss different evidences that support the therapeutic use of these cadherins by blocking their capacity to work as integrin ligands in order to develop new cures for metastatic patients.",Int J Mol Sci,2019,"['Casal JI', 'Bartolomé RA']",

Transcriptional intermediary factor 1γ (TIF1γ) which is a vital protein molecule that possesses ubiquitination enzyme activity, can mediate TGF-β induced EMT. We aimed to investigate the detailed mechanism between VPA and EMT occurrence in PCa cells to clarify the potential mechanism of TIF1γ involved. In our vitro experiments, we first investigated the effect of VPA on the expression TIF1γ. After TIF1γ was knockdown or overexpressed by related lentivirus, EMT of PCa cells were assessed. When TIF1γ knockdown or overexpress stable cell line were established, cells were treated with additional VPA, EMT index were detected and functional experiments were also conducted to confirm whether VPA inhibited EMT of PCa cells via TIF1γ. The mono-ubiquitination of Smad4 was analyzed simultaneously. In vivo, mice were facilitated with PC3 cells or TIF1γ related knockdown or overexpress virus transfected PC3 cells with or without VPA administration. Results showed that in vitro VPA can increase the expression of TIF1γ and also induce the increase expression of E-cadherin, and the decrease of N-cadherin and vimentin. Knocking down of TIF1γ can effectively block the effect of VPA on EMT and metastasis while overexpression of TIF1γ can strengthen its role. In vivo VPA also showed its anti-growth effect including tumor growth and EMT mediated by TIF1γ coincide with in vitro experiments. In conclusion, VPA inhibits the EMT in PCa cells via up-regulating the expression of TIF1γ and the mono-ubiquitination Smad4. VPA could serve as a promising agent in PCa treatment, with new strategies based on its diverse effects on posttranscriptional regulation.",Eur. J.

In the present study, the function of NLK in human non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was investigated. Immunohistochemical analysis and western blotting demonstrated that NLK expression was significantly reduced in NSCLC tissues compared with corresponding peritumoral tissues. Statistical analysis revealed that decreased NLK expression was associated with the presence of primary tumors, tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging, differentiation, lymph node metastasis, and E‑cadherin and vimentin expression. Univariate analysis indicated that NLK expression, differentiation, lymph node metastasis, TNM stage, and E‑cadherin and vimentin expression affected the prognosis of NSCLC. Cox regression analyses revealed NLK expression and TNM as independent factors that affected prognosis. Kaplan‑Meier survival analysis revealed that patients with NSCLC and low NLK expression had relatively shorter durations of overall survival. In vitro, NLK overexpression inhibited A549 ncell migration and invasion as determined by wound healing and Transwell migration assays, respectively. Additionally, immunofluorescence staining indicated that downregulation of NLK expression could induce epithelial‑mesenchymal transition in NSCLC. NLK knockdown significantly decreased the expression of the epithelial marker E‑cadherin, and markedly increased that of β‑catenin and the mesenchymal marker vimentin. Furthermore, NLK was reported to directly interact with β‑catenin as determined by a co‑immunoprecipitation assay. Collectively, the results of the present study indicated that decreased NLK expression could promote tumor metastasis in NSCLC.",Oncol.

31322179,"Reactive oxygen species induce epithelial‑mesenchymal transition, glycolytic switch, and mitochondrial repression through the Dlx‑2/Snail signaling pathways in MCF‑7 cells.","Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important cellular second messengers involved in various aspects of cell signaling. ROS are elevated in multiple types of cancer cells, and this elevation is known to be involved in pathological processes of cancer. Although high levels of ROS exert cytotoxic effects on cancer cells, low levels of ROS stimulate cell proliferation and survival by inducing several pro‑survival signaling pathways. In addition, ROS have been shown to induce epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is essential for the initiation of metastasis. However, the precise mechanism of ROS‑induced EMT remains to be elucidated. In the present study, it was indicated that ROS induce EMT by activating Snail expression, which then represses E‑cadherin expression in MCF‑7 cells. It was further indicated that distal‑less homeobox‑2 (Dlx‑2), one of the human Dlx gene family proteins involved in embryonic development, acts as an upstream regulator of ROS‑induced Snail expression. It was also revealed that ROS treatment induces the glycolytic switch, a phenomenon whereby cancer cells primarily rely on glycolysis instead of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation for ATP production, even in the presence of oxygen. In addition, ROS inhibited oxidative phosphorylation and caused cytochrome c oxidase inhibition via the Dlx‑2/Snail cascade. These results suggest that ROS induce EMT, the glycolytic switch and mitochondrial repression by activating the Dlx‑2/Snail axis, thereby playing crucial roles in MCF‑7 cancer cell progression.",Mol Med Rep,2019,"['Lee SY', 'Ju MK', 'Jeon HM', 'Lee YJ', 'Kim CH', 'Park HG', 'Han SI', 'Kang HS']",
31319863,Large oncosomes overexpressing integrin alpha-V promote prostate cancer adhesion and invasion via AKT activation.,"BACKGROUND: Molecular markers for prostate cancer (PCa) are required to improve the early definition of patient outcomes. Atypically large extracellular vesicles (EVs), referred as ""Large Oncosomes"" (LO), have been identified in highly migratory and invasive PCa cells. We recently developed and characterized the DU145R80 subline, selected from parental DU145 cells as resistant to inhibitors of mevalonate pathway. DU145R80 showed different proteomic profile compared to parental DU145 cells, along with altered cytoskeleton dynamics and a more aggressive phenotype.
METHODS: Immunofluorescence staining and western blotting were used to identify blebbing and EVs protein cargo. EVs, purified by gradient ultra-centrifugations, were analyzed by tunable resistive pulse sensing and multi-parametric flow cytometry approach coupled with high-resolution imaging technologies. LO functional effects were tested in vitro by adhesion and invasion assays and in vivo xenograft model in nude mice. Xenograft and patient tumor tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: We found spontaneous blebbing and increased shedding of LO from DU145R80 compared to DU145 cells. LO from DU145R80, compared to those from DU145, carried increased amounts of key-molecules involved in PCa progression including integrin alpha V (αV-integrin). By incubating DU145 cells with DU145R80-derived LO we demonstrated that αV-integrin on LO surface was functionally involved in the increased adhesion and invasion of recipient cells, via AKT. Indeed either the pre-incubation of LO with an αV-integrin blocking antibody, or a specific AKT inhibition in recipient cells are able to revert the LO-induced functional effects. Moreover, DU145R80-derived LO also increased DU145 tumor engraftment in a mice model. Finally, we identified αV-integrin positive LO-like structures in tumor xenografts as well as in PCa patient tissues. Increased αV-integrin tumor expression correlated with high Gleason score and lymph node status.

31315644,ADAR1 promotes the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and stem-like cell phenotype of oral cancer by facilitating oncogenic microRNA maturation.,"BACKGROUND: Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are involved in adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing and implicated in tumorigenesis and prognosis. Emerging evidence has indicated that ADAR1, an ADAR family member, participates in the regulation of various cancers; however, its biological function in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the role of ADAR1 in OSCC progression.
METHODS: ADAR1 expression in both normal tissues and carcinoma tissues and in OSCC cell lines was examined by real-time PCR and western blotting. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches were used to examine the effect of ADAR1 on the migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness of OSCC. Furthermore, the relationship between ADAR1 and Dicer was determined by co-immunoprecipitation, and the expression of OSCC-associated oncogenic miRNAs was evaluated by real-time PCR. For in vivo experiments, a xenograft model where OSCC cells stably expressing ADAR1 were implanted was used to investigate the effect of ADAR1 on tumor growth and progression, and the expression of ADAR1, PCNA, SOX2 and POU5F1 was further detected by immunohistochemistry. The impact of ADAR1 expression on the survival status of OSCC patients was determined by survival analysis.
RESULTS: ADAR1 was overexpressed in OSCC and significantly associated with poor patient survival. There was a positive correlation between ADAR1 and the migration, invasion, EMT and stemness of OSCC. Mechanistically, ADAR1 was physically associated with Dicer, and six OSCC-associated oncogenic miRNAs were increased in OSCC cells with ADAR1 overexpression. In the mouse xenograft model of OSCC, ADAR1 overexpression promoted tumor growth and progression. Moreover, ADAR1 was highly expressed in OSCC patients with low survival rates.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that ADAR1 may play a significant role in OSCC progression via combining with Dicer to regulate oncogenic miRNA maturation and further affect cell migration and invasion.",J.

METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the expression pattern of PLEKHG5 in 61 glioma patients after curative resection. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic significance of PLEKHG5. Gene ontology (GO) analysis, Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis and Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were used to predict potential functions of PLEKHG5. Migration assay and western blot analysis determined PLEKHG5 function in glioma migration and invasion.
RESULTS: Increased PLEKHG5 expression levels were associated with higher glioma grades (P < 0.05). In addition, glioblastomas multiforme have higher ratio and stronger intensity of PLEKHG5 expression compared with low-grade gliomas. High expression level of PLEKHG5 indicated poorer prognosis and shorter survival time in all glioma patients (P < 0.001). GO analysis, KEGG pathway analysis and GSEA analysis suggested that PLEKHG5 was involved in glioma migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

31306413,Molecular dissection of the oncogenic role of ETS1 in the mesenchymal subtypes of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) is a heterogeneous disease of significant mortality and with limited treatment options. Recent genomic analysis of HNSCC tumors has identified several distinct molecular classes, of which the mesenchymal subtype is associated with Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and shown to correlate with poor survival and drug resistance. Here, we utilize an integrated approach to characterize the molecular function of ETS1, an oncogenic transcription factor specifically enriched in Mesenchymal tumors. To identify the global ETS1 cistrome, we have performed integrated analysis of RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq and epigenomic datasets in SCC25, a representative ETS1high mesenchymal HNSCC cell line. Our studies implicate ETS1 as a crucial regulator of broader oncogenic processes and specifically Mesenchymal phenotypes, such as EMT and cellular invasion. We found that ETS1 preferentially binds cancer specific regulator elements, in particular Super-Enhancers of key EMT genes, highlighting its role as a master regulator. Finally, we show evidence that ETS1 plays a crucial role in regulating the TGF-β pathway in Mesenchymal cell lines and in leading-edge cells in primary HNSCC tumors that are endowed with partial-EMT features. Collectively our study highlights ETS1 as a key regulator of TGF-β associated EMT and reveals new avenues for sub-type specific therapeutic intervention.",PLoS Genet.,2019,"['Gluck C', 'Glathar A', 'Tsompana M', 'Nowak N', 'Garrett-Sinha LA', 'Buck MJ', 'Sinha S']",
31303496,Sleeping beauty genetic screen identifies miR-23b::BTBD7 gene interaction as crucial for colorectal cancer metastasis.,"BACKGROUND: Metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a deadly disease. Identifying locally advanced CRC patients with high risk of developing metastasis and improving outcome of metastatic CRC patients require discovering master regulators of metastasis. In this context, the non-coding part of the human genome is still largely unexplored.
METHODS: To interrogate the non-coding part of the human genome and disclose regulators of CRC metastasis, we combined a transposon-based forward genetic screen with a novel in vitro assay, which forces cells to grow deprived of cell-substrate and cell-cell contacts (i.e. forced single cell suspension assay - fSCS).
FINDINGS: We proved that fSCS selects CRC cells with mesenchymal and pro-metastatic traits. Moreover, we found that the transposon insertions conferred CRC cells resistance to fSCS and thus metastatic advantage. Among the retrieved transposon insertions, we demonstrated that the one located in the 3'UTR of BTBD7 disrupts miR-23b::BTBD7 interaction and contributes to pro-metastatic traits. In addition, miR-23b and BTBD7 correlate with CRC metastasis both in preclinical experiments and in clinical samples.
INTERPRETATION: fSCS is a simple and scalable in vitro assay to investigate pro-metastatic traits and transposon-based genetic screens can interrogate the non-coding part of the human genome (e.g. miRNA::target interactions). Finally, both Btbd7 and miR-23b represent promising prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in CRC.

31302315,Jatrorrhizine inhibits mammary carcinoma cells by targeting TNIK mediated Wnt/β-catenin signalling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).,"BACKGROUND: Traf2 and Nck interacting serine protein kinase (TNIK) is a tumour target protein which its high expression is closely related to the occurrence and development of mammary carcinoma cells. Molecular docking revealed that jatrorrhizine, a protoberberine alkaloid, exhibits good binding affinity and interaction with TNIK. However, the underlying mechanisms of jatrorrhizine targeting TNIK inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer cells remain unclear.
METHODS: To figure out the mechanisms in vitro and in vivo, the CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to knockout TNIK gene and detected qualitatively by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting assay. The MTT cell viability assay for cytotoxicity test, the apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry, the migration and invasion were evaluated by colony formation, wound healing assay and cell invasion assay, respectively. Anticancer effects were further corroborated by 4T1/Luc homograft tumour model.
RESULTS: The results showed that targeted knockout of TNIK that attenuated Wnt/β-catenin signalling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) expression, the effects were potentiated by the addition of jatrorrhizine. Moreover, jatrorrhizine distinctly inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and 4T1 cells with IC
CONCLUSION: These findings provide an overall perspective that jatrorrhizine potentially restrains TNIK regulating Wnt/β-catenin signalling and EMT expression for mammary cancer targeted therapy.",Phytomedicine,2019,"['Sun Y', 'Gao X', 'Wu P', 'Wink M', 'Li J', 'Dian L', 'Liang Z']",
31301870,Myeloid zinc finger-1 regulates expression of cancer-associated fibroblast and cancer stemness profiles in breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Osteopontin acts thru myeloid zinc finger-1 and transforming growth factor-β to drive the adoption of a cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype by local mesenchymal stem cells. Cancer-associated fibroblasts increase cancer cell stemness.
METHODS: Mesenchymal stem cells were exposed to osteopontin or were cocultured with MB231 human breast cancer cells (high osteopontin producer) in the presence or absence of aptamer (inactivates extracellular osteopontin). Myeloid zinc finger-1 phosphorylation sites were identified, and phosphomutants of T134 (SCAN domain) and S453 (zinc finger DNA binding domain) were constructed. Transforming growth factor-β F and cancer-associated fibroblast markers (smooth muscle actin, vimentin, and tenascin-c) were measured in mesenchymal stem cells. In MB231, stemness markers Sox2, Nanog, and Oct4 were measured.
RESULTS: Mesenchymal stem cells plus osteopontin increased transforming growth factor-β and cancer-associated fibroblast markers (P < .05 vs mesenchymal stem cells alone); this was abolished by aptamer inactivation of osteopontin. In mesenchymal stem cells transfected with phosphoresistant myeloid zinc finger-1, osteopontin did not increase cancer-associated fibroblast markers or transforming growth factor-β. In contrast, phosphomimetic myeloid zinc finger-1 increased cancer-associated fibroblast markers and transforming growth factor-β (P < .05 vs mesenchymal stem cells alone). In mesenchymal stem cells plus MB231, MB231 stemness markers were increased (P < .05 vs MB231 alone). In MB231 plus mesenchymal stem cells expressing phosphoresistant myeloid zinc finger-1, MB231 stemness markers were not increased in comparison with MB231 plus mesenchymal stem cells.
CONCLUSION: Myeloid zinc finger-1 phosphorylation in mesenchymal stem cells drives the osteopontin-mediated cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype, which then increases the cancer cell stemness profile.",Surgery,2019,"['Kuo MC', 'Kuo PC', 'Mi Z']",
31301662,"The Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition, E-cadherin and Tumor Progression in Ovarian Serous Tumors.","BACKGROUND: The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is a change in the cell phenotype from epithelial to mesenchymal morphology, is an important step in the invasion process and metastasis of ovarian carcinomas. It is known that the suppression of cell adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin and the expression of mesenchymal markers such as Vimentin are key processes in EMT. There is controversy in the literature about the EMT status of ovarian carcinomas.
AIM: To investigate EMT status using immunohistochemical expression of E-cadherin in benign, primary malignant serous ovarian tumors and metastases from them in order to assess their significance in tumor progression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included a retrospective investigation of 217 ovarian epithelial tumors. Ninety-two cases of serous ovarian tumors and metastases were examined for expression of E-cadherin.
RESULTS: In our study, the predominant histological subtype in benign ovarian tumors and carcinomas was serous (73% and 61%, respectively). 65% of benign tumors demonstrated EMT negative status. The majority of carcinomas demonstrated EMT positive status (82%), whereas negative EMT status was only observed in 18% of cases. 89% of the metastases showed EMT positive status, whereas only 11% of them showed negative EMT status. In 6 selected cases with positive EMT status we found Vimentin expression in tumor cells.
CONCLUSION: Positive EMT status (reduced E-cadherin expression) is a characteristic of ovarian carcinomas and metastases, but not of benign serous ovarian tumors.",Folia Med (Plovdiv),2019,"['Bozhkova DM', 'Poryazova-Markova EG']",

MiR-326 expression often down-regulates in several kinds of cancer and low expression of miR-326 is linked with poor prognosis in cancer patients. In the present study, we aimed to explore the modulatory mechanism of miR-326 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). miR-326 expression was significantly decreased in HCC cell lines and tissues. miR-326 decreased HCC cell growth by affecting cell-cycle progression and by promoting apoptosis. In addition, miR-326 inhibited HCC cell invasion by decreasing the EMT phenotype. We found that miR-326 functioned as a tumour suppressor by repressing its down-stream target PDK1. C-myc contributed to miR-326 down-regulation through binding at its promoter and inhibited its expression. Based on these results, we conducted a therapeutic experiment by using gold nano-particles (AuNPs) carrying miR-326.

31296856,Regulation of tumor angiogenesis and mesenchymal-endothelial transition by p38α through TGF-β and JNK signaling.,"The formation of new blood vessels is essential for normal development, tissue repair and tumor growth. Here we show that inhibition of the kinase p38α enhances angiogenesis in human and mouse colon tumors. Mesenchymal cells can contribute to tumor angiogenesis by regulating proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. We show that p38α negatively regulates an angiogenic program in mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), multipotent progenitors found in perivascular locations. This program includes the acquisition of an endothelial phenotype by MSCs mediated by both TGF-β and JNK, and negatively regulated by p38α. Abrogation of p38α in mesenchymal cells increases tumorigenesis, which correlates with enhanced angiogenesis. Using genetic models, we show that p38α regulates the acquisition of an endothelial-like phenotype by mesenchymal cells in colon tumors and damage tissue. Taken together, our results indicate that p38α in mesenchymal cells restrains a TGF-β-induced angiogenesis program including their ability to transdifferentiate into endothelial cells.",Nat Commun,2019,"['Batlle R', 'Andrés E', 'Gonzalez L', 'Llonch E', 'Igea A', 'Gutierrez-Prat N', 'Berenguer-Llergo A', 'Nebreda AR']",
31296243,Intestinal dysbacteriosis-induced IL-25 promotes development of HCC via alternative activation of macrophages in tumor microenvironment.,"BACKGROUND: Gut microbiota and the tumor microenvironment are thought to be critical factors that modulate the processes of liver diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Interleukin-25 (IL-25) promotes type 2 immunity via alternative activation of macrophages, and is closely associated with inflammation-related diseases, even malignancies. However, it is not clear which role IL-25 plays in the development of HCC, and whether gut microbiota are involved.
METHODS: IL-25 was detected by ELISA, Western blotting (WB), and immunohistochemistry. Chemokines were measured by RT-qPCR and WB. After co-culture with IL-25-stimulated macrophages, the cell growth, migration, invasion and EMT marker of HCC cell lines (MHCC97L and HepG2) were evaluated by Brdu proliferation, Transwell assays and WB. An antibody neutralization assay of chemokine CXCL10 was performed to confirm its role in HCC development. Furthermore, the effects of IL-25 in HCC were investigated in vivo. Dysbiosis of gut microflora was induced by antibiotics (vancomycin, cefoperazone or combination of ampicillin, neomycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin). We used feces suspension to treat colonic epithelial NCM460 cells, and detected IL-25 and tuft cell marker DCLK1 using WB and immunofluorescence staining.
RESULTS: We found that the level of IL-25 was significantly elevated in HCC patients, and was negatively correlated with survival rate after hepatectomy. However, IL-25 did not directly promote the development of HCC cells. Then, we observed the significant positive correlation between IL-25 level and M2 percentage (CD206/CD68) in HCC tumors. In vitro and in vivo, IL-25 induced alternative activation of macrophages promoted HCC cell migration, invasion and tumorigenesis, increased the expression of vimentin, Snail and phospho-ERK, and decreased the expression of E-cadherin in HCC cells. After IL-25 treatment, chemokine CXCL10 was increased in macrophages. Neutralizing CXCL10 in macrophage-conditioned medium reversed the IL-25-mediated effect on HCC cells. Vancomycin-induced dysbiosis promoted the growth of orthotopic HCC homograft. Surprisedly, we found the hyperplasia of colonic epithelial tuft cells, from which more IL-25 was secreted .
CONCLUSIONS: IL-25 promotes the progression of HCC through inducing alternative activation and CXCL10 secretion of macrophages in tumor microenvironment, and IL-25 secretion may partly result from hyperplastic epithelial tuft cells in colon, induced by gut microbiota dysbiosis.",J.

31288528,FPR2 enhances colorectal cancer progression by promoting EMT process.,"Formyl peptide receptor-2 (FPR2) has been shown to promote various tumors, but its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been clearly illuminated. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of FPR2 interference on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis, pro-angiogenesis of CRC cells, and also the mechanisms involved. Quantitative PCR assays were applied to assess the expression levels of FPR2 in CRC tissues. CRC cell line SW1116 was chosen to perform this study. We knocked down FPR2 gene by sh-RNA. Then, the cell proliferation was assayed by soft agar colony formation assay, the cell migration capacity was checked by wound healing assay, and cell invasion ability was detected by transwell assay. In addition, flow cytometric analysis was used to detect apoptosis, while endothelial tube formation assay was used to evaluate the effects of FPR2 on pro-angiogenesis in vitro. Tumorigenesis experiment in vivo was performed in nude mice. EMT-related proteins were studied by western blotting. Quantitative PCR demonstrated that FPR2 mRNA was highly expressed in the colorectal cancer tissues. SW1116 cells' capacities of proliferation, migration, invasion, anti-apoptosis and pro-angiogenesis were distinctly suppressed after silencing FPR2 in SW1116 by sh-RNA. Suppression FPR2 mRNA in SW1116 cells suppressed tumorigenicity in nude mice. The expression of proteins related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) such as E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Snail, Slug and vimentin was changed after suppressing FPR2. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that FPR2 could promote CRC cells progression in vitro and in vivo that may relate to promoting EMT.",Neoplasma,2019,"['Lu J', 'Zhao J', 'Jia C', 'Zhou L', 'Cai Y', 'Ni J', 'Ma J', 'Zheng M', 'Lu A']",
31286874,RNF43 ubiquitinates and degrades phosphorylated E-cadherin by c-Src to facilitate epithelial-mesenchymal transition in lung adenocarcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: In epithelial cells, tyrosine kinases induce tyrosine phosphorylation and ubiquitination of the E-cadherin complex, which is responsible for the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the precise mechanisms remain unclear.
METHODS: Protein antibody microarray analysis and E3 ligase profiling were performed to detect the unique E3 ligase underlying E-cadherin downregulation in lung adenocarcinoma tissues. Gene knockdown was performed using viral shRNA. Immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, and xenograft models in vivo were integratively applied to explore RNF43-induced EMT in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines.
RESULTS: Protein antibody microarray analysis and E3 ligase profiling revealed that the RING finger protein 43 (RNF43) was linked to E-cadherin downregulation within the context of c-Src activation in lung adenocarcinoma tissues. In addition, the c-Src-Caspase-8 interaction markedly increased c-Src activity. Activated c-Src phosphorylated E-cadherin at the tyrosine 797 site to initiate RNF43-mediated E-cadherin ubiquitination at lysine 816 and subsequent degradation, thus allowing the nuclear translocation of β-catenin and upregulation of Vimentin and RNF43 expression in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Decreased E-cadherin expression and increased Vimentin expression induced the EMT phenotype and promoted tumor metastasis. The Frizzled 8 (Frz8)-RNF43-induced ubiquitination of phosphorylated E-cadherin was blocked by a monoclonal antibody against the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of Frz8 but not by antibodies against the protease domain (PA) of RNF43.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that RNF43 participates in the regulation of EMT in the metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma through the ubiquitination and degradation of phosphorylated E-cadherin by activated c-Src.",BMC Cancer,2019,"['Zhang Y', 'Sun L', 'Gao X', 'Guo A', 'Diao Y', 'Zhao Y']",
31281549,TFAP4 Promotes Hepatocellular Carcinoma Invasion and Metastasis via Activating the PI3K/AKT Signaling Pathway.,"Transcription factor activating enhancer binding protein 4 (TFAP4) is established as a regulator of human cancer genesis and progression. Overexpression of TFAP4 indicates poor prognosis in various malignancies. The current study was performed to quantify TFAP4 expression as well as to further determine its potential prognostic value and functional role in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We identified that the expression of TFAP4 mRNA in 369 tumor tissues was higher than that in 160 normal liver tissues. Upregulated TFAP4 expressions were discovered in HCC cell lines compared to the healthy liver cell line, and similarly, the levels of TFAP4 were higher in tumor tissues than its expression in paratumor tissues. High mRNA and protein expression of TFAP4 was associated with worse overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Additionally, TFAP4 expression emerged as a risk factor independently affecting both OS and DFS of HCC patients. Functional studies demonstrated that TFAP4 increased HCC cell migration and invasion. Further investigations found that TFAP4 promotes invasion and metastasis by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and regulating MMP-9 expression via activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in HCC. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that TFAP4 is a valuable prognostic biomarker in determining the likelihood of tumor metastasis and recurrence, as well as the long-term survival rates of HCC patients. Exploring the regulatory mechanism of TFAP4 will also contribute to the development of new prevention and treatment strategies for HCC.",Dis.

We found that MIR503HG was downregulated and TGF-β2 was upregulated in CRC included in this study. Low levels of MIR503HG were associated with poor survival of CRC patients within 5 years after admission. MIR503HG and TGF-β2 were inversely correlated in CRC tissues, and in CRC cells, MIR503HG overexpression was accompanied by TGF-β2 downregulation, while TGF-β2 overexpression did not affect MIR503HG. TGF-β2 overexpression mediated the increased migration and invasion rates of CRC cells. MIR503HG overexpression mediated the decreased migration and invasion rates of CRC cells. Moreover, TGF-β2 overexpression reduced the effects of MIR503HG overexpression. Therefore, MIR503HG overexpression inhibits CRC cell migration and invasion mediated by TGF-β2.",Gene,2019,"['Chuo D', 'Liu F', 'Chen Y', 'Yin M']",
31278883,Kinesin family member C1 accelerates bladder cancer cell proliferation and induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition via Akt/GSK3β signaling.,"Kinesin family member C1 (KIFC1) is implicated in the clustering of multiple centrosomes to maintain tumor survival and is thought to be an oncogene in several kinds of cancers. In our experiments, we first performed bioinformatics analysis to investigate the expression levels of KIFC1 in bladder cancer (BC) specimens and normal bladder epitheliums and then, using our samples, verified findings by quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting assays. All data showed that KIFC1 was significantly upregulated in BC specimens at both the mRNA and protein levels. Immunohistochemical studies in a cohort of 152 paraffin-embedded BC tissues displayed that upregulated expression of KIFC1 clearly correlated with pT status (P = .014) and recurrent status (P = .002). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank test indicated that patients with BC with high KIFC1 expression had both shorter cancer-specific survival (P < .001) and recurrence-free survival time (P < .001) than those with low KIFC1 expression. Furthermore, ectopic downregulation of KIFC1 weakened BC cell proliferation and migration both in vitro and in vivo, whereas upregulation of KIFC1 enhanced this in vitro. Overexpression of KIFC1 phosphorylated GSK3β and promoted Snail through activating AKT (protein kinase B0) to induce proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and, therefore, substantially promoted BC migration and metastasis. Our study revealed an oncogenic role for KIFC1 to promote BC cell proliferation and EMT via Akt/GSK3β signaling; KIFC1 might be a promising prognostic biomarker as well as a therapeutic target for BC.",Cancer Sci.,2019,"['Xiao KH', 'Teng K', 'Ye YL', 'Tan L', 'Chen MK', 'Liang HT', 'Feng ZH', 'Duan JL', 'Deng MH', 'Wei WS', 'Luo JH', 'Qin ZK', 'Xie D']",
31278880,Effects of metformin and phenformin on apoptosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in chemoresistant rectal cancer.,"Recurrence and chemoresistance in colorectal cancer remain important issues for patients treated with conventional therapeutics. Metformin and phenformin, previously used in the treatment of diabetes, have been shown to have anticancer effects in various cancers, including breast, lung and prostate cancers. However, their molecular mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, we examined the effects of these drugs in chemoresistant rectal cancer cell lines. We found that SW837 and SW1463 rectal cancer cells were more resistant to ionizing radiation and 5-fluorouracil than HCT116 and LS513 colon cancer cells. In addition, metformin and phenformin increased the sensitivity of these cell lines by inhibiting cell proliferation, suppressing clonogenic ability and increasing apoptotic cell death in rectal cancer cells. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and transforming growth factor-β/Smad signaling pathways were more activated in rectal cancer cells, and inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 expression using an inhibitor or siRNA sensitized rectal cancer cells to chemoresistant by inhibition of the expression of antiapoptotic proteins, such as X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, survivin and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1. Moreover, metformin and phenformin inhibited cell migration and invasion by suppression of transforming growth factor β receptor 2-mediated Snail and Twist expression in rectal cancer cells. Therefore, metformin and phenformin may represent a novel strategy for the treatment of chemoresistant rectal cancer by targeting signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and transforming growth factor-β/Smad signaling.",Cancer Sci.,2019,"['Park JH', 'Kim YH', 'Park EH', 'Lee SJ', 'Kim H', 'Kim A', 'Lee SB', 'Shim S', 'Jang H', 'Myung JK', 'Park S', 'Lee SJ', 'Kim MJ']",
31277684,NKAP alters tumor immune microenvironment and promotes glioma growth via Notch1 signaling.,"BACKGROUND: Glioma is one of the most aggressive malignant brain tumors which is characterized with highly infiltrative growth and poor prognosis. NKAP (NF-κB activating protein) is a widely expressed 415-amino acid nuclear protein that is overexpressed by gliomas, but its function in glioma was still unknown.
METHODS: CCK8 and EDU assay was used to examine the cell viability in vitro, and the xenograft models in nude mice were established to explore the roles of NAKP in vivo. The expressions of NKAP, Notch1 and SDF-1 were analyzed by immunofluorescence analysis. The expression of NKAP and Notch1 in glioma and normal human brain samples were analyzed by immunohistochemical analysis. In addition, CHIP, Gene chip, western blot, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, ELISA and luciferase assay were used to investigate the internal connection between NKAP and Notch1.
RESULTS: Here we showed that overexpression of NKAP in gliomas could promote tumor growth by contributing to a Notch1-dependent immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment. Downregulation of NKAP in gliomas had abrogated tumor growth and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, compared to the control group, inhibiting NKAP set up obstacles to tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) polarization and recruitment by decreasing the secretion of SDF-1 and M-CSF. To identify the potential mechanisms involved, we performed RNA sequencing analysis and found that Notch1 appeared to positively correlate with the expression of NKAP. Furthermore, we proved that NKAP performed its function via directly binding to Notch1 promoter and trans-activating it. Notch1 inhibition could alleviate NKAP's gliomagenesis effects.
CONCLUSION: these observations suggest that NKAP promotes glioma growth by TAM chemoattraction through upregulation of Notch1 and this finding introduces the potential utility of NKAP inhibitors for glioma therapy.",J.

However, the mechanism underlying YAP downregulation in laryngeal cancer is still unclear. In our previous study, we found that YAP, compared with adjacent tissues, was expressed higher in laryngeal cancer and was also closely associated with histological differentiation, TNM stage and poor prognosis.
METHODS: In this study, we attempted to determine whether silenced YAP could downregulate human laryngeal carcinoma Hep-2 cells progression. YAP was downregulated in Hep-2 cells by shRNA, and the malignant ability of Hep-2 was assessed in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: In vitro, CCK-8, colony formation and wound healing assays showed that downregulation of YAP significantly reduced the rates of proliferation, migration, and invasion in Hep-2 cells. Downregulation of YAP distinctly induced G2/M cycle arrest and increased the rate of apoptosis. Accordingly, western blot assay suggested that the expression of DKK1, vimentin and β-catenin was significantly decreased after YAP downregulated treatment, thereby indicating that YAP mediated the EMT programme and the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway in carcinoma of the larynx. Furthermore, silencing of YAP suppressed Hep-2 cell tumourigenesis and metastasis in vivo.
CONCLUSION: In summary, our findings demonstrated the proliferation of YAP downregulation and the invasion of Hep-2 cells via downregulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that YAP may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of laryngeal cancer.",BMC Cancer,2019,"['Tang X', 'Sun Y', 'Wan G', 'Sun J', 'Sun J', 'Pan C']",

This study evaluated whether RON affects oncogenic behavior, oncogenic signaling pathways, and clinical outcomes, including survival, in human OSCC. Reverse transcription‑PCR, quantitative PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemical staining were used to determine mRNA and protein expression levels of RON. Cell invasion, migration and apoptosis assays were used to assess the functional effects of small interfering RNA‑mediated knockdown of RON or snail family transcriptional repressor 2 (SLUG). RON knockdown suppressed tumor cell invasion and migration and enhanced apoptosis in human OSCC cells. RON knockdown also decreased the phosphorylation of MAPK signaling proteins, such as ERK1/2, JNK and p38. In addition, RON knockdown suppressed the expression of the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)‑related transcription factor, SLUG. SLUG knockdown blocked the enhancement of cell invasion and migration induced by macrophage‑stimulation protein (MSP)‑mediated RON activation in OSCC cells. The cell morphology was changed to spindle‑like shape under MSP‑mediated RON activation in OSCC cells. RON was overexpressed in both fresh and paraffin‑embedded human OSCC tissues. Taken together, these results indicate that RON contributed to tumor progression by regulating the EMT‑related factor, SLUG, and the MAPK pathway in OSCC.

31268154,COL6A1 promotes metastasis and predicts poor prognosis in patients with pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive cancers worldwide with a high mortality rate. Prognosis remains poor even in this era of advanced medicine mainly due to early metastasis and invasion. The present study aimed to explore and validate predictors of distant metastasis and prognosis in pancreatic cancer. In our preliminary experiment, we established a novel metastatic pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC‑M8 from parent BxPC‑3 cells. Via whole genome sequencing, RT‑qPCR, western blotting, migration and invasion assays, we initially found that BxPC‑M8 shared similar biological characteristics to BxPC‑3, but only differed in enhanced metastatic and invasive capabilities with a significant increase in collagen type VI α1 chain (COL6A1) expression. Knockdown of COL6A1 via small interfering RNA led to a significant decrease in migration and invasion of BxPC‑M8 cells, suggesting suppressed epithelial‑mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, a significant increase in COL6A1 expression was observed in cancerous tissue compared with paracancerous tissue (40.7 vs 3.7, P=0.001). Additionally, its expression was observed to be significantly associated with distant metastasis and vascular invasion at the time of surgery. Multivariate analysis revealed that COL6A1 expression (hazard ratio 1.90, 95% confidence interval 1.04‑3.47, P=0.037) is an independent predictor of overall survival (OS). The median OS observed for COL6A1+ and COL6A1‑ patients was found to be 8±4 and 14±7 months (P=0.021), respectively. Of note, we identified that COL6A1 expression in tissue samples was associated with significantly reduced OS (P=0.001), demonstrating that COL6A1 may serve an important role in the metastatic process and could be considered as a predictor of poor outcomes in patients with pancreatic cancer. In addition, our findings suggest that COL6A1 could be an indicator of distant metastasis and a valid prognostic predictor in such patients; however, further investigation is required.",Int. J.

It is predominantly expressed in various tumor subtypes and has shown its association in the regulation of various important genes which include ECM-degrading proteases. Our study aimed to understand the mechanism(s) in the pathogenesis of breast carcinogenesis by Ets-1 transcription factor and its downstream target gene MMP-9. Role of Ets-1 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells was studied by RNA-interference in combination with pull down and ChIP assays to identify the regulation of MMP-9 in these cell lines. Our results showed that transfection of Ets-1 siRNA in breast cancer cell lines resulted in downregulation of Ets-1 and MMP-9. Ets-1 knock down also showed reduced cell invasion and altered expression of EMT markers. Moreover, we could also predict that MMP-9 gene promoter harbors a binding site for Ets-1 transcription factor may be responsible in direct transactivation of Ets-1 along with EMT markers.

31264317,Overexpression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in breast cancer cell lines remarkably increases the cell malignancy largely via activation of transforming growth factor beta/SMAD signalling.,"OBJECTIVES: Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) has been frequently noticed in the breast cancers. In this study, we aim to investigate the associations of MMP-9 with the activation of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)/SMAD signalling and the malignancy of breast malignant tumour cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The distributions of MMP-9 and TGF-β in the tissues of canine breast cancers were screened by immunohistochemical assays. A recombinant plasmid expressing mouse MMP-9 was generated and transiently transfected into three different breast cancer cell lines. Cell Counting Kit-8 and colony formation assay were used to study cell viability. Migration and invasion ability were analysed by wound assay and transwell filters. Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR were used to determine the protein and mRNA expression.
RESULT: Remarkable strong MMP-9 and TGF-β signals were observed in the malignant tissues of canine breast cancers. In the cultured three cell lines receiving recombinant plasmid expressing mouse MMP-9, the cell malignancy was markedly increased, including the cell colony formation, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The levels of activated TGF-β, as well as SMAD4, SMAD2/3 and phosphorylation of SMAD2, were increased, reflecting an activation of TGF-β/SMAD signalling. We also demonstrated that the inhibitors specific for MMP-9 and TGF-β sufficiently blocked the overexpressing MMP-9 induced the activation of SMAD signalling and enhancement on invasion in the tested breast cancer cell lines.
CONCLUSION: Overexpression of MMP-9 increases the malignancy of breast cancer cell lines, largely via activation of the TGF-β/SMAD signalling.",Cell Prolif.,2019,"['Dong H', 'Diao H', 'Zhao Y', 'Xu H', 'Pei S', 'Gao J', 'Wang J', 'Hussain T', 'Zhao D', 'Zhou X', 'Lin D']",
31262888,Cetrimonium Bromide Inhibits Cell Migration and Invasion of Human Hepatic SK-HEP-1 Cells Through Modulating the Canonical and Non-canonical TGF-β Signaling Pathways.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Cetrimonium bromide (CTAB), a quaternary ammonium surfactant, is an antiseptic agent against bacteria and fungi. However, the mechanisms by which its pharmacological actions affect epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, such as adenocarcinoma in SK-HEP-1 cells, have not been investigated. We, thereby, investigated whether CTAB inhibits cellular mobility and invasiveness of human hepatic adenocarcinoma in SK-HEP-1 cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: SK-HEP-1 cells were treated with CTAB, and subsequent migration and invasion were measured by wound healing and transwell assays. Protein expression was detected by immunoblotting analysis.
RESULTS: Our data revealed that treatment of SK-HEP-1 cells with CTAB altered their mesenchymal spindle-like morphology. CTAB exerted inhibitory effects on the migration and invasion of SK-HEP-1 cells dose-dependently, and reduced protein levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, snail, slug, twist, vimentin, fibronectin, N-cadherin, Smad2, Smad3, Smad4, phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), p-PI3K, Akt, p-Akt, β-catenin, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), p-mTOR, p-p70S6K, p-extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)1/2, p-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and p-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but increased protein levels of tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), TIMP-2, claudin-1 and p-GSK3β. Based on these observations, we suggest that CTAB not only inhibits the canonical transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway though reducing SMADs (an acronym from the fusion of Caenorhabditis elegans Sma genes and the Drosophila Mad, Mothers against decapentaplegic proteins), but also restrains the non-canonical TGF-β signaling including MAPK pathways like ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, JNK and PI3K.
CONCLUSION: CTAB is involved in the suppression of TGF-β-mediated mesenchymal phenotype and could be a potent medical agent for use in controlling the migration and invasion of hepatic adenocarcinoma.",Anticancer Res.,2019,"['Wu TK', 'Chen CH', 'Pan YR', 'Hu CW', 'Huang FM', 'Liu JY', 'Lee CJ']",
31262852,The Hippo Signaling Pathway in Pancreatic Cancer.,"Hippo signaling is a key regulator of organ size, tissue hemostasis and regeneration. Dysregulation of the Hippo pathway has been recognized in a variety of human cancers, including pancreatic cancer. YES-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are the two major downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway. YAP and TAZ have been found to promote pancreatic tumor development and progression, even in the absence of mutant Kirsten RAS (KRAS). Pancreatic cancer is associated with an abundant stromal reaction leading to tumor growth and immune escape. It has been found that YAP and TAZ modulate behavior of pancreatic stellate cells and recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Moreover, YAP and TAZ are associated with chemoresistance and poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer. This review dissects the role of Hippo signaling in pancreatic cancer, focusing on molecular mechanisms and prospects for future intervention.",Anticancer Res.,2019,"['Ansari D', 'Ohlsson H', 'Althini C', 'Bauden M', 'Zhou Q', 'Hu D', 'Andersson R']",

The aim of this study was to present the influence of oxymatrine on non-small cell lung cancer cells. The results indicate, that this agent induces dose-dependent cell death mainly through ER stress-induced apoptosis pathway. We also suggest that the oxymatrine reduces the metastatic potential by inhibition of the EMT process, as A549 cells treated with chosen doses of the compound were characterized by a decrease in the expression of the N-cadherin, vimentin and the elevation of E-cadherin level.

However, the occurrence of clinical 5-FU resistance is a major reason for CRC therapy failure. This study intended to explore the possible role of long non-coding RNA HOTAIRM1 (HOTAIRM1) in the pathogenesis of 5-FU resistant CRC and its underlying mechanism. Our data showed that HOTAIRM1 was downregulated in CRC tissues and cell lines (HCT116 and SW480), and even lower in 5-FU resistant CRC tissues and cell lines (HCT116/5-FU and SW480/5-FU). In vitro, effects of HOTAIRM1 dysregulation in 5-FU resistant CRC cells were investigated and its overexpression could reduce cell viability, invasion, migration, and multi-drug resistance as evidenced by MTT assay, Transwell assay, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and western blot analyzing expression of drug-resistant genes MRP1 and MDR1, respectively. Mechanically, dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) identified that HOTAIRM1 and B-cell translocation gene 3 (BTG3) were target genes of miR-17-5p. Moreover, miR-17-5p was upregulated and BTG3 was downregulated in HCT116/5-FU and SW480/5-FU cells. Silencing of miR-17-5p showed suppressive role on cell viability, invasion, migration, and multi-drug resistance in HCT116/5-FU and SW480/5-FU cells, which could be abolished by HOTAIRM1 knockdown. Similarly, ectopic expression of miR-17-5p reversed BTG3-mediated inhibition on cell viability, invasion, migration, and multi-drug resistance. In vivo, the tumorigenesis of HCT116/5-FU cells when highly expressed HOTAIRM1 by lentivirus infection was inhibited through downregulating miR-17-5p and upregulating BTG3. In conclusion, HOTAIRM1 might act as a tumor-suppressor in 5-FU resistant CRC cells in vitro and in vivo through downregulating miR-17-5p/BTG3 pathway and inhibiting multi-drug resistance.",Biomed.

MAIN METHODS: The antineoplastic activity of taxifolin was evaluated in MDA-MB-231 and 4 T1 cells by crystal violet assay and colony formation assay. The effects of taxifolin on migration and invasion were determined by wound healing assay and Transwell assay, respectively. mRNA and protein expression of genes were assayed respectively with qRT-PCR and western blot, and the protein expression and location was also detected by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. β-catenin overexpression was performed with adenovirus infection. The effects of taxifolin on growth and metastasis of breast cancer in vivo were investigated in BALB/c mice bearing 4T1 xenografts.
KEY FINDINGS: We found that taxifolin had the potential to inhibit proliferation, migration and invasion of highly aggressive breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, taxifolin promoted the MET process, the reversed process of EMT, as evaluated by EMT markers and EMT-transcriptional factors in breast cancer cell lines. Meanwhile, the protein and mRNA expressions of β-catenin were dose-dependently downregulated by taxifolin, and overexpression of β-catenin by adenoviruses abrogated these beneficial effects of taxifolin above-mentioned. Furthermore, within a 4T1 xenograft mouse model, taxifolin markedly inhibited the growth of primary tumors and reduced lung metastasis of breast cancer.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings provide a theoretical foundation for the possibility of taxifolin used as a promising agent in the clinical treatment of highly aggressive breast cancer patients.",Life Sci.,2019,"['Li J', 'Hu L', 'Zhou T', 'Gong X', 'Jiang R', 'Li H', 'Kuang G', 'Wan J', 'Li H']",
31253779,TSPAN8 promotes cancer cell stemness via activation of sonic Hedgehog signaling.,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) represent a major source of treatment resistance and tumor progression. However, regulation of CSCs stemness is not entirely understood. Here, we report that TSPAN8 expression is upregulated in breast CSCs, promotes the expression of the stemness gene NANOG, OCT4, and ALDHA1, and correlates with therapeutic resistance. Mechanistically, TSPAN8 interacts with PTCH1 and inhibits the degradation of the SHH/PTCH1 complex through recruitment of deubiquitinating enzyme ATXN3. This results in the translocation of SMO to cilia, downstream gene expression, resistance of CSCs to chemotherapeutic agents, and enhances tumor formation in mice. Accordingly, expression levels of TSPAN8, PTCH1, SHH, and ATXN3 are positively correlated in human breast cancer specimens, and high TSPAN8 and ATXN3 expression levels correlate with poor prognosis. These findings reveal a molecular basis of TSPAN8-enhanced Sonic Hedgehog signaling and highlight a role for TSPAN8 in promoting cancer stemness.",Nat Commun,2019,"['Zhu R', 'Gires O', 'Zhu L', 'Liu J', 'Li J', 'Yang H', 'Ju G', 'Huang J', 'Ge W', 'Chen Y', 'Lu Z', 'Wang H']",

We have investigated the role of GINS4 in NSCLC.
METHODS: The expression of chromatin modifier lymphoid-specific helicase (LSH) and GINS4 was assessed in tumor and normal tissue from 79 patients with NSCLC with clinical characteristics. HBE, A549, H358, and H522, PC9, 95C and 95D were cultured after overexpression or silencing of GIAT4RA. Cell proliferation assay, cell migration and invasion assays, plate colony formation assay, immunofluorescence assay, Operetta® high-content screening and analysis, Western blot analysis and Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay, RNA immunoprecipitation assay and tumor growth assay was used to address the potential interplay of between GINS4 and LSH, and the functional of GINS4.
RESULTS: GINS4 is highly expressed in lung cancer cells and tissues, and GINS4 expression is not association with clinical risk factors, but linked with clinical stage and lymphatic metastasis status. Higher expression of GINS4 poorly linked with overall survival in lung adenocarcinomas. Furthermore, GINS4 promoted many characteristics of tumorigenesis including cell growth, clonal formation, migration and invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, tumor sphere and tumor growth in vivo. Interestingly, our results demonstrated that LSH increases GINS4 expression through binding to 3'UTR region of GINS4 and stabilizing its mRNA levels. Finally, LSH overexpression rescues GINS4 knockdown-induced features.

31251827,"hnRNPM, a potential mediator of YY1 in promoting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of prostate cancer cells.","BACKGROUND: With the popularity of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening, the number of newly diagnosed prostate cancer (PCa) patients is increasing. However, indolent or invasive PCa cannot be distinguished by PSA levels. Here, we mainly explored the role of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M (hnRNPM) in the invasiveness of PCa.
METHODS: Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot analysis was used to detect the expressions of hnRNPM in PCa and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) tissues as well as in PCa cell lines. Immunohistochemistry was applied to detect the hnRNPM or Yin Yang 1 (YY1) expression in BPH, prostate adenocarcinoma (ADENO) and neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) tissues. After aberrant, the expression of hnRNPM in C4-2 and PC3 cells, the changes of cell migration and invasion were observed through wound-healing and transwell assays. We also predicted the transcription factor of hnRNPM through databases, then verified the association of hnRNPM and YY1 using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase assays.
RESULTS: The expression level of hnRNPM is gradually reduced in BPH, ADENO, and NEPC tissues and it is less expressed in more aggressive PCa cell lines. Overexpression of hnRNPM can significantly reduce Twist1 expression, which inhibits the migration and invasion of PCa cells in vitro. In PCa cells, overexpression of YY1 can promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition by reducing hnRNPM expression. Furthermore, this effect caused by overexpression of YY1 can be partially attenuated by simultaneous overexpression of hnRNPM.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that hnRNPM negatively regulated PCa cell migration and invasion, and its expression can be transcriptionally inhibited by YY1. We speculated that hnRNPM may be a biomarker to assist in judging the aggressiveness of PCa.",Prostate,2019,"['Yang T', 'An Z', 'Zhang C', 'Wang Z', 'Wang X', 'Liu Y', 'Du E', 'Liu R', 'Zhang Z', 'Xu Y']",
31251735,MicroRNA-181c Suppresses the Biological Progression of Osteosarcoma via Targeting SMAD7 and Regulating Transforming Growth Factor-β (TGF-β) Signaling Pathway.,"BACKGROUND Osteosarcoma is a primary bone aggressive cancer, affecting adolescents worldwide. Increasing evidence suggests that dysfunction of microRNAs (miRNAs) plays a pivotal role in malignancies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential functions of miR-181c and verifying its regulatory effects on SMAD7 in osteosarcoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS The expressions of miR-181c and SMAD7 in osteosarcoma were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell proliferation, invasion and migration abilities were assessed using MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) and Transwell assay. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay were used to explore the interaction between miR-181c and SMAD7. Western blot was performed to determine the functions of miR-181c on osteosarcoma cell epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and transforming growth factor-ß (TGF-ß) signaling pathway. RESULTS Decreased expression levels of miR-181c and SMAD7 were identified in osteosarcoma using qRT-PCR. The downregulated miR-181c and SMAD7 expressions indicated poor prognosis of osteosarcoma patients. Moreover, miR-181c overexpression prominently repressed osteosarcoma cell proliferation, invasion, and migration abilities via modulating EMT and TGF-ß signaling pathway. SMAD7 functioned as an important target for miR-181c in osteosarcoma cells. Furthermore, upregulation of miR-181c dramatically suppressed osteosarcoma tumorigenesis in vivo. CONCLUSIONS These findings indicated that miR-181c suppressed osteosarcoma progression, providing new insight into the pathogenesis and representing a potential therapeutic target for osteosarcoma.",Med.

31248373,"Monospecific antibody targeting of CDH11 inhibits epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and represses cancer stem cell-like phenotype by up-regulating miR-335 in metastatic breast cancer, in vitro and in vivo.","BACKGROUND: Metastasis is a leading cause of breast cancer mortality. The induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and complex oncogenic signaling is a vital step in the evolution of highly metastatic and therapeutically-intractable breast cancer; necessitating novel target discovery or development of therapeutics that target metastatic breast cells (MBCs).
METHODS: To achieve this, this study employs a combination of in silico bioinformatics analyses, protein and transcript analyses, drug sensitivity assays, functional assays and animal studies.
RESULTS: The present study identified CDH11 as an inductor and/or facilitator of metastatic signaling, and biomarker of poor prognosis in MBCs. Furthermore, we showed that in the presence of CDH11-rich cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 MBC cell lines acquired enhanced metastatic phenotype with increased CDH11, β-catenin, vimentin, and fibronectin (FN) expression. We also demonstrated, for the first time to the best of our knowledge that exposure to anti-CDH11 antibody suppresses metastasis, reduces CDH11, FN and β-catenin expression, and abrogate the cancer stem cell (CSC)-like traits of MBC cells. Interestingly, ectopic expression of miR-335 suppressed CDH11, β-catenin and vimentin expression, in concert with attenuated metastatic and CSC potentials of the MBC cells; conversely, inhibition of miR-335 resulted in increased metastatic potential. Finally, corroborating the in silica and in vitro findings, in vivo assays showed that the administration of anti-CDH11 antibody or miR-335 mimic suppressed tumorigenesis and inhibited cancer metastasis.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings validate our hypotheses that miR-335 mediates anti-CDH11 antibody therapy response and that an enhanced miR-335/CDH11 ratio elicits marked suppression of the MBC CSC-like and metastatic phenotypes, thus revealing a therapeutically-exploitable inverse correlation between CDH11-enhanced CSC-like and metastatic phenotype and miR-335 expression in MBCs. Thus, we highlight the therapeutic promise of humanized anti-CDH11 antibodies or miR-335-mimic, making a case for their clinical application as efficacious therapeutic option in patients with MBC.",BMC Cancer,2019,"['Chen JH', 'Huang WC', 'Bamodu OA', 'Chang PM', 'Chao TY', 'Huang TH']",
31247333,Effect of cigarette smoke extract on mitochondrial heme-metabolism: An in vitro model of oral cancer progression.,"Tobacco smoking is considered as one of the major risk factors for development of oral cancer. In vitro studies indicate that cigarette smoke initiates transformation of epithelial cells toward development of oral cancer through altering mitochondrial metabolic pathways. However the present in vitro models need to be improved to correlate these molecular changes with epithelial transformations. In present study, we investigated the association of mitochondrial metabolic events with oral cancer progression under cigarette smoke extract (CSE). In this regard, an in vitro model of oral keratinocyte cell line (MOE1A) was developed by exposing them with different concentrations of CSE. Alterations in cellular phenomena were confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) study, which indicated changes in important functional groups of CSE-induced oral cells. Enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) of exposed cells altered the mitochondrial metabolic activities in terms of increased mitochondrial mass and DNA content. Further, mitochondrial heme-metabolism was investigated and real-time PCR study showed altered expression of important genes like ALAS1, ABCB6, CPOX, FECH, HO-1. Both transcriptomic and proteomic studies showed up- and down-regulation of important biomarkers related to cellular cancer progression.

Some long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to function as promoters or inhibitors of cancer metastasis. This study aimed to identify p-EMT-related lncRNAs in HNSCC.
METHODS: Differentially expressed lncRNAs (DE-lncRNAs) and mRNAs (DEGs) in HNSCC obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were screened out by using the ""edgeR"" package. DE-lncRNAs in the Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) lncRNA microarray dataset GSE84805 were screened out by using the ""limma"" package. Slug-related lncRNAs were determined by Pearson correlation analysis (|Pearson correlation coefficient| ≥ 0.4, p < 0.01) based on TCGA. Survival analysis were performed for the overlapping DE-lncRNAs by using the ""Survival"" package. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were used to predict the potential functions of MYOSLID. RT-qPCR and In Site Hybridization (ISH) were used to explore the MYOSLID expression and its clinical significance in HNSCC specimens. Immunohistochemical staining, siRNA, wound healing assay, transwell assay, and western blot were used to explore the biological function and potential molecular mechanisms.
RESULTS: MYOSLID was identified as a Slug-related lncRNA and with prognostic value among the 9 overlapping DE-lncRNAs. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that MYOSLID was closely related to important biological processes and pathways that regulate cancer metastasis. The results of univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis based on TCGA and HNSCC tissue microarray data suggested MYOSLID was an independent prognostic factor. MYOSLID expression in HNSCC was closely correlated with Slug, PDPN and LAMB3. The knockdown of MYOSLID in OSCC cell line significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion compared to those in the control cells. In addition, the knockdown of MYOSLID significantly reduced Slug, PDPN and LAMB3 expression levels. However, the knockdown of MYOSLID had no effect on the expression levels of the EMT biomarkers E-cadherin and Vimentin.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that MYOSLID expression was closely related to the p-EMT program in HNSCC, and it might be a new predictive biomarker for aggressive HNSCC.",J. Exp. Clin.

31238027,Vitamin K3 (menadione) suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal-transition and Wnt signaling pathway in human colorectal cancer cells.,"Tumor recurrence and metastasis decrease the survival rate of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Menadione reduces the numbers and incidences of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine induced colon tumors in mouse but the mechanism of anticancer activity of menadione in colorectal cancer is not very clear. Since Wnt signaling is constitutively active in CRC and it aggravates the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), the regulation of EMT and Wnt signaling by menadione (vitamin K3) was investigated in CRC cells. Menadione showed cytotoxicity against human CRC cells (SW480 and SW620) and human primary colon cancer cells but was relatively ineffective against the cells from human normal colon (CRL-1790) and human primary colon epithelial cells. Menadione suppressed invasion, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in human CRC cells by upregulating the expression of E-cadherin (CDH1), ZO-1 and downregulating that of N-cadherin (CDH2), Vimentin (VIM), ZEB1, MMP2 and MMP9. Menadione decreased TOPFlash/FOPFlash luciferase activity and expression of several downstream targets of Wnt signaling and coactivators such as β-catenin (CTNNB1), TCF7L2, Bcl9l, p300 (EP300) and cyclin D1 (CCND1) was suppressed. Menadione induced differentiation and increased apoptotic cell population in SubG0 phase of cell cycle in SW480 and SW620 cells.

31237760,Enhancement of Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor Sensitivity in Combination with Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibition for the Treatment of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Previous research has indicated that the currently available histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) are not effective as monotherapies against oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). However, HDACis act synergistically with other therapeutic agents to exert significant antitumor activities. Thus, a strategy to develop chemotherapeutic agents by combining several active groups based on histone deacetylase (HDAC) into a single molecule as a conjugate that modulates multiple cellular pathways may be useful for the treatment of OSCC.
METHODS: The novel inhibitor Roxyl-ZR was prepared by organic synthesis and its anticancer effects on OSCC were investigated by cell metabolism (n=5), colony formation (n=3), cell cycle (n=3), cell apoptosis (n=3), wound healing (n=3), transwell migration (n=3), and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine staining (n=3) assays in vitro and in in vivo xenograft mice models (4 mice/group for subcutaneous xenograft and 3 mice/group for orthotopic xenograft ). The abundance of Ki67, Bcl-2, and p-STAT3 was detected by immunohistochemistry staining (n=4). Apoptotic cells in the tumor tissues of mice were detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nickend labeling assay (n=3). The abundance of related proteins levels were evaluated by western blot (n=3). E-cadherin expression was detected by an immunofluorescence assay (n=3).
RESULTS: Compared with the approved HDACi, conjugated Roxyl-ZR exhibited significantly higher antitumor effects in OSCC cells. Roxyl-ZR suppressed OSCC cell proliferation by inducing the reduction of S phase and inducing caspase-dependent apoptosis by down-regulating Bcl-2 expression. Moreover, Roxyl-ZR attenuated the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which is closely associated with migration and invasion. In addition, Roxyl-ZR inhibited OSCC xenograft mice models and showed low toxicity. The mechanism underlying the Roxyl-ZR-enhanced sensitivity to HDACi may be attributed to the inhibition of key regulators of JAK1-STAT3 signaling pathway.

31234944,Epiregulin reprograms cancer-associated fibroblasts and facilitates oral squamous cell carcinoma invasion via JAK2-STAT3 pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Local resident normal fibroblasts (NFs) are the major source of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are distinguishable from NFs by their tumor-supportive properties. However, the mechanism and the effects underlying the transition of NFs to CAFs in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remain unclear.
METHODS: Five pairs of matching primary NFs and CAFs derived from OSCC patients were sent for RNA sequencing. Epiregulin (EREG) expression was analyzed by IHC in fibroblasts from OSCC patients. The role of EREG in the NF-CAF transition and the consequential effects on OSCC progression were examined by upregulation/downregulation of EREG in NFs/CAFs both in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: Here, we identified epiregulin (EREG) as the most remarkably upregulated gene in CAFs. High EREG expression in CAFs correlated with higher T stage, deeper invasion and inferior worst pattern of invasion (WPOI) in OSCC patients and predicted shorter overall survival. Overexpression of EREG in NFs activated the CAF phenotype. Mechanistically, the JAK2/STAT3 pathway was enhanced by EREG in parallel with increased IL-6 expression, which could be inhibited by the JAK2 inhibitor AG490. Recombinant IL-6 upregulated the JAK2/STAT3/EREG pathway in a feedback loop. Moreover, EREG-induced CAF activation promoted the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) necessary for migration and invasion, which was dependent on JAK2/STAT3 signaling and IL-6. In vivo, EREG expression in stroma fibroblasts promoted tumor growth with high stromal α-SMA, phospho-JAK2/STAT3, and IL-6 expression and upregulated EMT in HSC3 cells.

31234902,Ubiquitin-specific protease 3 promotes cell migration and invasion by interacting with and deubiquitinating SUZ12 in gastric cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin-specific protease 3 (USP3) plays a crucial role in numerous biological processes. The aberrant expression of USP3 may have an important role in tumor development. However, the mechanism by which USP3 promotes gastric cancer (GC) metastasis remains largely unknown.
METHODS: Effects of USP3 on the progression of GC in vivo and in vitro and the potential underlying mechanisms have been investigated utilizing proteomics, RT-PCR, western blotting, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, cell invasion and migration assays and xenograft tumor models.
RESULTS: USP3 expression was upregulated in GC compared with matched normal tissues and was predictive of poor survival. USP3 also promoted migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in GC cells. Moreover, TGF-β1 induced USP3 expression, and USP3 knockdown inhibited TGF-β1-induced EMT. Furthermore, we utilized Isobaric Tag for Relative and Absolute Quantitation (iTRAQ) to identify differentially expressed proteins in USP3-overexpressing cells compared with control cells. Importantly, we found that SUZ12 is indispensable for USP3-mediated oncogenic activity in GC. We observed that USP3 interacted with and stabilized SUZ12 via deubiquitination. SUZ12 knockdown inhibited USP3-induced migration and invasion, as well as EMT in GC cells. Examination of clinical samples confirmed that USP3 expression was positively correlated with SUZ12 protein expression and that the levels of USP3 or SUZ12 protein were negatively correlated with the levels of E-cadherin protein.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings identify USP3 as a critical regulator. The USP3-SUZ12 axis might promote tumor progression and could be a potential therapeutic candidate for human GC.",J. Exp. Clin.

31234887,E2A attenuates tumor-initiating capacity of colorectal cancer cells via the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.,"BACKGROUND: The E2A gene, which encodes two basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, E12 and E47, regulates colorectal cancer progression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. However, whether E2A regulates the tumor-initiating capacity of colorectal cancer is unclear. Thus, we have studied E2A expression in the initiation of colorectal cancer in vivo and in vitro.
METHODS: Immunohistochemistry and immunoblot were performed to determine protein levels of E2A in colorectal cancer specimens and cells. RNAi was employed to downregulate E2A expression, and the subsequent change in protein level was evaluated by immunoblot. Sphere-forming assay and enumeration of liver metastasis in mouse models were used to identify the tumor formation ability of colorectal cancer cells.
RESULTS: E2A expression in colorectal cancer clinical specimens was inversely associated with patients' progression-free survival. Functional studies demonstrated that E2A significantly decreased tumor formation in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, nuclear translocation of beta-catenin and activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway occurred after suppression of E2A in colorectal cancer cells. FoxM1 was identified as a down-stream target by mRNA microarray, implying that FoxM1 plays a main role in determining how E2A regulates the tumor-initiating capacity of colorectal cancer.
CONCLUSION: E2A suppresses tumor-initiating capacity by targeting the FoxM1-Wnt/β-catenin pathway.",J. Exp. Clin. Cancer Res.,2019,"['Zhao H', 'Zhao C', 'Li H', 'Zhang D', 'Liu G']",
31233198,Targeting the differentiation of gastric cancer cells (KATO‑III) downregulates epithelial‑mesenchymal and cancer stem cell markers.,"The aim of the present study was to analyze the acquisition of the differentiated phenotype in the human gastric signet ring cell adenoma cancer KATO‑III cell line in vitro. The morphology of KATO‑III cells was explored by microcinematography. Different cytokines secreted by both adherent and non‑adherent KATO‑III cells into medium were observed. The cancer stem cell phenotypes were identified by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction using primers (E‑Cad, Slug, Snail, vimentin, NANOG, NESTIN, OCT3/4 and C‑X‑C motif chemokine receptor 4) or antibodies [cluster of differentiation (CD)90 and CD117] by flow cytometry (FACS). The influence of the induction media for the differentiation of mesenchymal cells was studied through viability and proliferation assays, by evaluating gene expression and the expression of markers via FACS. Cell viability and cell cycle distribution were evaluated following the treatment of KATO‑III with acetyl salicylic acid and using the induction media as an inhibitor of epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) and heparanase. A total of 3 phenotypes of KATO‑III were observed (adherent, non‑adherent and cell cluster), which have internal potential for cell transition into one of the other phenotypes. KATO‑III was differentiated into adipocyte‑, chondrocyte‑, osteocyte‑ and neurocyte‑like cells by the induction media. Identification of the induced cells was conducted using cell dyes. Reduced mRNA expression of EMT‑associated molecules, stem cell markers and heparanase was observed with acetyl salicylic acid and induction media. An inhibitory effect of acetyl salicylic acid and the induction media was also noted in regard to cell proliferation. In addition, acetyl salicylic acid induced G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest in KATO‑III cells. In conclusion, the induction of the differentiation of cancer stem cells into non‑proliferating cells offers the possibility for novel drug design to overcome the issues associated with metastasis, drug resistance and systemic toxicity with improved therapeutic efficacy.",Oncol.

31233187,Comparison of cofilin‑1 and Twist‑1 protein expression in human non‑small cell lung cancer tissues.,"Metastasis is the primary cause of mortality in patients with non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Actin cytoskeletal reorganization is usually accompanied by the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT)‑induced invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. In the present study, expression levels of the actin‑associated protein cofilin‑1 and of the pivotal EMT molecule Twist‑1 were determined in NSCLC tissues. Using lung cancer tissue arrays, the identification of 67.4% of tissue spots that exhibited reciprocal levels of cofilin‑1 and Twist‑1 was achieved by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. This reciprocal expression pattern was also detected in 21 out of 25 clinicopathological NSCLC tissue sections, and in 10 out of 15 NSCLC cell lines. In addition, high levels of cofilin‑1 and low levels of Twist‑1 accounted for 80 and 71.5% of the reciprocal expression pattern in tissue arrays and clinicopathological tissue samples, respectively. This pattern was also detected in normal lung tissues, stage I and II lung cancer tissues, and adenocarcinoma subtypes of NSCLC tissues. Although cofilin‑1 and Twist‑1 were expressed inversely, a positive correlation of these two proteins was present in normal lung tissues and lung tumor tissues. Furthermore, enforced expression of cofilin‑1 suppressed the expression level of Twist‑1 in NSCLC H1299 cells. An on‑line Kaplan‑Meier survival analytic tool allowed access to a public microarray dataset with a maximum of 1,926 NSCLC samples. The analysis revealed that high expression levels of both cofilin‑1 (CFL1) and Twist‑1 (TWIST1) genes were associated with decreased survival of NSCLC patients, notably with regard to the adenocarcinoma subtype. The analysis was conducted using the multivariate Cox regression model. Although the reciprocal association of the expression levels of cofilin‑1 and Twist‑1 with the survival rate of NSCLC patients requires additional information, it may be a significant indicator of the progression of NSCLC.",Oncol.

31229922,Prostate carcinoma cell-derived exosomal MicroRNA-26a modulates the metastasis and tumor growth of prostate carcinoma.,"Prostate carcinoma may develop into metastatic castration-resistant prostate carcinoma (mCRPC) after endocrine therapy. Exosomal microRNAs play an important role in the regulation of tumor microenvironment. Our study aimed to investigate the effect of exosomal miR-26a on tumor phenotype of prostate carcinoma. Low-grade prostate carcinoma cell line (LNCAP) and mCRPC cell line (PC-3) were treated as experimental subjects according to their miR-26a expressions. Wound healing, transwell and colony-forming unit assays were performed after miR-26a mimic/inhibitor transfection. Then, exosomes were isolated from LNCAP and PC-3 cells, and the levels of exosomal miR-26a were determined. After co-culture of LNCAP (PC-3) cells with PC-3 (LNCAP) exosomes, changes in malignant behaviors were measured. Moreover, LNCAP/PC-3 exosomes were injected into xenograft tumor mice to determine effects of the exosomes on tumorigenicity of LNCAP and PC-3 cells. MiR-26a showed a potently inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, migration and invasion of LNCAP and PC-3 cells. LNCAP exosomes had a higher miR-26a level, compared with PC-3 exosomes. Overexpression of miR-26a attenuated the enhanced malignant behavior of LNCAP cells induced by PC-3 exosomes, and miR-26a inhibition could reverse the inhibitory effects of LNCAP exosomes on PC-3 cells. Exosomal miR-26a could significantly alter the expressions of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related factors. Moreover, LNCAP exosomes suppressed the tumorigenicity of PC-3 cells, while PC-3 exosomes could promote the tumorigenicity of LNCAP cells. Our data suggest that exosomal miR-26a derived from prostate carcinoma cells had a suppressive effect on the metastasis and tumor growth of prostate carcinoma.",Biomed.

31228948,DEPTOR induces a partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and metastasis via autocrine TGFβ1 signaling and is associated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: DEPTOR is an endogenous inhibitor of mTORC1 and mTORC2 that plays a vital role in the progression of human malignances. However, the biological function of DEPTOR in HCC metastasis and the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unclear.
METHODS: Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry(IHC) were employed to examine DEPTOR expression in HCC cell lines and tissues. A series of in vivo and in vitro assays were performed to determine the function of DEPTOR and the possible mechanisms underlying its role in HCC metastasis.
RESULTS: We found that DEPTOR was frequently overexpressed in HCC tissues, and its high expression was associated with high serum AFP levels, increased tumor size, vascular invasion and more advanced TMN and BCLC stage, as well as an overall poor prognosis. Functional experiments demonstrated that DEPTOR silencing inhibited the proliferation and mobility of HCC cells in vitro and suppressed tumor growth and metastasis of HCC cells in vivo. Accordingly, DEPTOR overexpression promoted the invasion and metastasis of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo, but had no effect on cell proliferation in vitro. Overexpression of DEPTOR induced EMT by snail induction. Conversely, knockdown of snail expression impaired the DEPTOR-induced migration, invasion and EMT of HCC cells. Furthermore, we found that the increase of snail expression by DEPTOR overexpression was due to an activation of TGF-β1-smad3/smad4 signaling possibly through feedback inhibition of mTOR.
CONCLUSION: DEPTOR promotes the EMT and metastasis of HCC cells by activating the TGF-β1-smad3/smad4-snail pathway via mTOR inhibition. Therefore, targeting DEPTOR may be an ideal treatment strategy for inhibiting the growth and metastasis of HCC.",J. Exp. Clin.

31228933,Constitutive Expression of NRAS with Q61R Driver Mutation Activates Processes of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and Leads to Substantial Transcriptome Change of Nthy-ori 3-1 Thyroid Epithelial Cells.,"The Q61R mutation of the NRAS gene is one of the most frequent driver mutations of thyroid cancer. Tumors with this mutation are characterized by invasion into blood vessels and formation of distant metastases. To study the role of this mutation in the growth of thyroid cancer, we developed a model system on the basis of thyroid epithelial cell line Nthy-ori 3-1 transduced by a lentiviral vector containing the NRAS gene with the Q61R mutation. It was found that the expression of NRAS(Q61R) in thyroid epithelial cells has a profound influence on groups of genes involved in the formation of intercellular contacts, as well as in processes of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cell invasion. The alteration in the expression of these genes affects the phenotype of the model cells, which acquire traits of mesenchymal cells and demonstrate increased ability for survival and growth without attachment to the substrate. The key regulators of these processes are transcription factors belonging to families SNAIL, ZEB, and TWIST, and in different types of tumors the contribution of each individual factor can vary greatly. In our model system, phenotype change correlates with an increase in the expression of SNAIL2 and TWIST2 factors, which indicates their possible role in regulating invasive growth of thyroid cancer with the mutation of NRAS(Q61R).",Biochemistry Mosc.,2019,"['Demin DE', 'Afanasyeva MA', 'Uvarova AN', 'Prokofjeva MM', 'Gorbachova AM', 'Ustiugova AS', 'Klepikova AV', 'Putlyaeva LV', 'Tatosyan KA', 'Belousov PV', 'Schwartz AM']",
31228451,ARHGAP25: A negative regulator of colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.,"Herein, we found ARHGAP25 was down-regulated in colon biopsies of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) also showed that ARHGAP25 was negatively correlated with Wnt/β-catenin activation. To study the role of ARHGAP25 in CRC and its possible mechanism, we established lentiviral-mediated ARHGAP25 overexpression in HCT116 and RKO cells along with siRNA-mediated ARHGAP25 knockdown in SW620 cells. The metastatic capacity of the CRC cell lines in vitro was assessed by measuring cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Additionally, expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9), EMT-associated factors (E-cadherin, ZEB1, Snail and Twist1) and β-catenin (a core part of Wnt/β-catenin signaling) was determined. XAV939, a Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor, was used for treatment. Our data suggests that ARHGAP25 overexpression significantly inhibits CRC cell growth, suppresses cell migration and invasion, and reduces expression of MMPs, EMT-associated factors and β-catenin. Our results suggest not only that ARHGAP25 has an anti-metastatic role in CRC cells, but also that the inactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is important in this process. Accordingly, siRNA-ARHGAP25 resulted in the opposite effect, favoring CRC metastasis in vitro, and activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in CRC cells. In addition, the siRNA-ARHGAP25 induced changes on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were significantly reversed with XAV939 treatment. Importantly, the anti-metastatic effects of ARHGAP25 were further substantiated in a CRC lung metastasis xenograft model. We conclude that ARHGAP25 negatively regulates the metastatic potential of CRC cells via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Thus, our findings implicate ARHGAP25 as a potential therapeutic target in CRC metastasis.",Eur. J. Pharmacol.,2019,"['Tao L', 'Zhu Y', 'Gu Y', 'Zheng J', 'Yang J']",
31228209,"Alterations in the expression of EMT-related proteins claudin-1, claudin-4 and claudin-7, E-cadherin, TWIST1 and ZEB1 in oral lichen planus.","BACKGROUND: Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic T-cell-mediated inflammatory disease, which is associated with increased risk of developing oral squamous cell carcinoma. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition is a physiological phenomenon occurring during growth and organogenesis, but it has also an important role in tumorigenesis. In the present work, we studied the expression of known epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers in oral lichen planus.
METHODS: In total, 54 oral lichen planus and 22 control samples were analyzed for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers. Samples were immunohistochemically stained for claudin-1, claudin-4 and claudin-7, cadherin-1 (E-cadherin), Twist-related protein 1 (TWIST1) and zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1).
RESULTS: The expression of claudin-1, claudin-4 and E-cadherin was significantly weaker in oral lichen planus epithelium compared to controls (P < 0.001). The quantity of claudin-7-expressing cells (P < 0.001) and claudin-7 staining intensity (P < 0.05) in the stroma was greater in lichen planus than in control samples. TWIST1 and ZEB1 stainings were negative in the epithelium in both lichen planus and controls. The number of TWIST1-expressing cells in the stroma was higher in lichen planus than in controls (P < 0.001). There was a statistically significant difference in ZEB1 staining intensity in the stroma between lichen planus and control samples (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that the expression of claudin-1, claudin-4 and E-cadherin is decreased in oral lichen planus. This may lead to disturbance in epithelial tight junctions, cell-cell connections and epithelial permeability, contributing to oral lichen planus pathogenesis. Based on the present study, the role of TWIST1 and ZEB1 in oral lichen planus remains unclear.",J. Oral Pathol. Med.,2019,"['Hämäläinen L', 'Soini Y', 'Pasonen-Seppänen S', 'Siponen M']",
31226820,Fibronectin Regulation of Integrin B1 and SLUG in Circulating Tumor Cells.,"Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are a critical step in the metastatic cascade and a good tool to study this process. We isolated CTCs from a syngeneic mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and a human xenograft mouse model of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). From these models, novel primary tumor and CTC cell lines were established. CTCs exhibited greater migration than primary tumor-derived cells, as well as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as observed from decreased E-cadherin and increased SLUG and fibronectin expression. Additionally, when fibronectin was knocked down in CTCs, integrin B1 and SLUG were decreased, indicating regulation of these molecules by fibronectin. Investigation of cell surface molecules and secreted cytokines conferring immunomodulatory advantage to CTCs revealed decreased major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) expression and decreased endostatin, C-X-C motif chemokine 5 (CXCL5), and proliferin secretion by CTCs. Taken together, these findings indicate that CTCs exhibit distinct characteristics from primary tumor-derived cells. Furthermore, CTCs demonstrate enhanced migration in part through fibronectin regulation of integrin B1 and SLUG. Further study of CTC biology will likely uncover additional important mechanisms of cancer metastasis.",Cells,2019,"['Huaman J', 'Naidoo M', 'Zang X', 'Ogunwobi OO']",
31223610,DCLK1 Plays a Metastatic-Promoting Role in Human Breast Cancer Cells.,"Background: Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) has been universally identified as a cancer stem cell (CSC) marker and is found to be overexpressed in many types of cancers including breast cancer. However, there is little data regarding the functional role of DCLK1 in breast cancer metastasis. In the present study, we sought to investigate whether and how DCLK1 plays a metastatic-promoting role in human breast cancer cells.
Methods: We used Crispr/Cas9 technology to knock out DCLK1 in breast cancer cell line BT474, which basically possesses DCLK1 at a higher level, and stably overexpressed DCLK1 in another breast cancer cell line, T47D, that basically expresses DCLK1 at a lower level. We further analyzed the alterations of metastatic characteristics and the underlying mechanisms in these cells.
Results: It was shown that, compared with the corresponding control cells, DCLK1 overexpression led to an increase in metastatic behaviors including enhanced migration and invasion of T47D cells. By contrast, forced depletion of DCLK1 drastically inhibited these metastatic characteristics in BT474 cells. Mechanistically, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program, which is critical for cancer metastasis, was prominently activated in DCLK1-overexpressing cancer cells, evidenced by a decrease in an epithelial marker ZO-1 and an enhancement in several mesenchymal markers including ZEB1 and Vimentin. In addition, DCLK1 overexpression induced the ERK MAPK pathway, which resultantly enhanced the expression of MT1-MMP that is also involved in cancer metastasis. Knockout of DCLK1 could reverse these events, further supporting a metastatic-promoting role for DCLK1.
Conclusions: Collectively, our data suggested that DCLK1 overexpression may be responsible for the increased metastatic features in breast cancer cells. Targeting DCLK1 may become a therapeutic option for breast cancer metastasis.",Biomed Res Int,2019,"['Liu H', 'Wen T', 'Zhou Y', 'Fan X', 'Du T', 'Gao T', 'Li L', 'Liu J', 'Yang L', 'Yao J', 'Ge Y', 'An G']",
31221586,HnRNP-F regulates EMT in bladder cancer by mediating the stabilization of Snail1 mRNA by binding to its 3' UTR.,"BACKGROUND: Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F (hnRNP-F) has been implicated in multiple cancers, suggesting its role in tumourigenesis, but the potential oncogenic role and mechanism of hnRNP-F in bladder cancer (BC) remain incompletely understood.
METHODS: HnRNP-F was identified by proteomic methods. A correlation of hnRNP-F expression with prognosis was analysed in 103 BC patients. Then, we applied in vitro and in vivo methods to reveal the behaviours of hnRNP-F in BC tumourigenesis. Furthermore, the interaction between hnRNP-F and Snail1 mRNA was examined by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), and Snail1 mRNA stability was measured after treatment with actinomycin D. Finally, the binding domain between hnRNP-F and Snail1 mRNA was verified by constructing Snail1 mRNA truncations and mutants.
FINDING: HnRNP-F is significantly upregulated in BC tissue, and its increased expression is associated with a poor prognosis in BC patients. HnRNP-F is necessary for tumour growth, inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis in BC. The changes in Snail1 expression were positively correlated with hnRNP-F at both the mRNA and protein levels when hnRNP-F was silenced or enhanced, suggesting that Snail1 is likely a downstream target of hnRNP-F that mediates its effects on enhancing invasion, metastasis and EMT in BC. The overexpression of hnRNP-F caused an increase in the stability of Snail1 mRNA. Our RNA chip analysis revealed that hnRNP-F could combine with Snail1 mRNA, and we further demonstrated that hnRNP-F could directly bind to the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of Snail1 mRNA to enhance its stability.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that hnRNP-F mediates the stabilization of Snail1 mRNA by binding to its 3' UTR, subsequently regulating EMT.",EBioMedicine,2019,"['Li F', 'Zhao H', 'Su M', 'Xie W', 'Fang Y', 'Du Y', 'Yu Z', 'Hou L', 'Tan W']",

In our study, we found that XB130 expression was signiﬁcantly upregulated in breast cancer and was closely related to the clinicopathologic characteristics, overall survival and poor prognosis of breast cancer patients. Functionally, we found that knockdown of XB130 was not only played an important role in proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and metastasis in breast cancer cells but also exhibited potent antitumor activity in animal tumor models.

The aim of our study is to explore the possible interaction between tumor-associated macrophages and tumor cells in the EMT process mediated by microRNA (miR)-362-3p. In this study, we found that by releasing TGF-β, M2 macrophages mediate binding of Smad2/3 to miR-362-3p promoter, leading to overexpression of miR-362-3p. MicroRNA-362-3p maintains EMT by regulating CD82, one of the most important members of the family of tetraspanins.

31212916,Regulation of TEAD Transcription Factors in Cancer Biology.,"Transcriptional enhanced associate domain (TEAD) transcription factors play important roles during development, cell proliferation, regeneration, and tissue homeostasis. TEAD integrates with and coordinates various signal transduction pathways including Hippo, Wnt, transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathways. TEAD deregulation affects well-established cancer genes such as KRAS, BRAF, LKB1, NF2, and MYC, and its transcriptional output plays an important role in tumor progression, metastasis, cancer metabolism, immunity, and drug resistance. To date, TEADs have been recognized to be key transcription factors of the Hippo pathway. Therefore, most studies are focused on the Hippo kinases and YAP/TAZ, whereas the Hippo-dependent and Hippo-independent regulators and regulations governing TEAD only emerged recently. Deregulation of the TEAD transcriptional output plays important roles in tumor progression and serves as a prognostic biomarker due to high correlation with clinicopathological parameters in human malignancies. In addition, discovering the molecular mechanisms of TEAD, such as post-translational modifications and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, represents an important means of modulating TEAD transcriptional activity.

31212809,Roles of E-cadherin and Noncoding RNAs in the Epithelial-mesenchymal Transition and Progression in Gastric Cancer.,"The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is thought to be at the root of invasive and metastatic cancer cell spreading. E-cadherin is an important player in this process, which forms the structures that establish and maintain cell-cell interactions. A partial or complete loss of E-cadherin expression in the EMT is presumably mediated by mechanisms that block the expression of E-cadherin regulators and involve the E-cadherin-associated transcription factors. The protein is involved in several oncogenic signaling pathways, such as the Wnt/β-catenin, Rho GTPase, and EGF/EGFR, whereby it plays a role in many tumors, including gastric cancer. Such noncoding transcripts as microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs-critical components of epigenetic control of gene expression in carcinogenesis-contribute to regulation of the E-cadherin function by acting directly or through numerous factors controlling transcription of its gene, and thus affecting not only cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, but also the EMT.

Scutellarin is an active flavone extracted from traditional Chinese herb Erigeron breviscapus (Vant.) Hand. Mazz. Recent studies have reported that scutellarin can be utilized to treat various types of tumors. In this study, we investigated the effects of scutellarin on melanoma cancer cell invasive potential and the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects using A375 melanoma cells lines. The in-vitro antitumor activity of scutellarin was evaluated by CCK-8 assay, wound-healing assay, transwell assays, adhesion assays, and tube formation assays to assess the cell viability, migration, invasion, adhesion, and angiogenesis, respectively. Also, western blotting assay was used to assess the level of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway proteins in A375 cells. We found that scutellarin significantly inhibited melanoma cell lines and HUVECs viability in a time- and concentration-dependent manners. Additionally, scutellarin effectively suppressed tumor cell migration, invasion, adhesion through the suppression of EMT and angiogenesis by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. These results indicated that scutellarin could markedly inhibit the invasive potential of melanoma cell lines by suppressing the EMT and angiogenesis through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. It suggests that scutellarin might be a potential compound in malignant melanoma treatment.",Eur. J. Pharmacol.,2019,"['Li CY', 'Wang Q', 'Wang X', 'Li G', 'Shen S', 'Wei X']",
31210202,Microfluidic co-culture of liver tumor spheroids with stellate cells for the investigation of drug resistance and intercellular interactions.,"Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), a major component of the tumor microenvironment in liver cancer, play important roles in cancer progression as well as drug resistance. Here, we presented a microchannel plate-based co-culture model that integrated Hepa1-6 tumor spheroids with JS-1 stellate cells in three-dimensional (3D) concave microwells to mimic the in vivo tumor microenvironment by recapitulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition and chemoresistance. The expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related markers and factors was analyzed using immunofluorescent staining and the changes in viability following exposure to different concentrations of paclitaxel were measured. Cell spheroids formed 3D tumor spheroids within 3 days. Culture conditions were optimized for Hepa1-6 cells and JS-1 cells, and their appropriate interactions were confirmed by reciprocal activation. JS-1 under co-culture showed a change in cellular morphology and an increased expression of α-SMA. The expression of EMT-related markers, such as vimentin and TGF-β1, was higher in the co-cultured Hepa1-6 spheroids compared to that in mono-cultured spheroids. Following paclitaxel exposure, JS-1 cells showed significant changes in survival under both mono- and co-culture conditions, while Hepa1-6 presented negligible changes. The proposed microfluidic platform makes it possible to observe the positioned three-dimensional cell spheroids, which would be extensively used not only for well-organized spheroid creation, but also for better quantitative and qualitative understanding of the cell-cell interaction effect.",Analyst,2019,"['Chen Y', 'Sun W', 'Kang L', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang M', 'Zhang H', 'Hu P']",
31207579,MicroRNA-98-HMGA2-POSTN signal pathway reverses epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.,"It has been widely considered that reversing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a potential access to restrain cancer progression and therapeutic resistance. Here, we aim to uncover the novel mechanisms by which we can reverse EMT and inhibit metastasis in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). We show that miR-98 is significantly reduced in both LSCC specimens and cell lines. Over-expression of miR-98 inhibits the EMT-related gene expression and metastasis and invasive behavior in LSCC in vitro, as well as reduces lung metastasis in mouse model. In the mechanistically study, miR-98 directly targets HMGA2 in mediating EMT. HMGA2 knock down by si-RNA method declines several EMT-related genes expression and LSCC migration and invasion. In parallel, overexpression of HMGA2 transforms LSCC cells to acquire stem cell-like features. Furthermore, we reveal that HMGA2-mediated EMT is closely linked with the expression of POSTN that inhibits EMT, as a tumor suppressor, by gene profiling analyses. POSTN is transcriptionally repressed by HMGA2. In clinic, the HMGA2 mRNA level is negatively correlated with the miR-98 level in LSCC patient cohort. In conclusion, our study confers a powerful signal: miR-98-HMGA-POSTN in LSCC, which is able to reverse EMT and inhibit metastasis, underlining the therapeutic potential of this signal.",Biomed.

Methods: Monocultures of SiHa cells, SiHa cells containing a control sequence, and 
Results: Compared with monocultured SiHa cells, co-cultured SiHa cells showed a significant increase in their invasiveness and expression levels of vimentin, as well as of NOTCH 1, LOX, and SNAIL1, whereas their expression of E-cadherin was significantly reduced and protein activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were increased.

Conclusion: Co-culture with human umbilical vein endothelial cells promoted the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of SiHa cells by activating the NOTCH1/LOX/SNAIL1 pathway in SiHa cells, which enhanced their invasive and metastatic capacities.

31202170,MMP-9 secreted by tumor associated macrophages promoted gastric cancer metastasis through a PI3K/AKT/Snail pathway.,"PURPOSE: The distant metastasis in gastric has become an obstacle for treatment in clinic. However, the underlying mechanism is not well illustrated. Here, our aim is to reveal the mechanism and try to explore the potential strategy to overcome the distant metastasis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: IHC was used to detect the expressions of target proteins. H&E staining was used to evaluate the lung metastasis. Using qRT-PCR and ELISA, we detected the expression of target genes and secreted proteins. Western bolt was used to examine the target proteins expression. Wound healing and transwell assay were used to examine the ability of cell to invasion and migration. Using IF, PI3K/AKT/Snail was examined. Animal models were applied to evaluate the killing efficiency in vivo.
RESULTS: Here, we observed accumulated CD68 (a marker of TAMs) in samples from gastric cancer patients with metastasis compared with that in samples from non-metastasis patients. And the expression of CD68 was negatively correlated with patients' survival time. Then, we found that TAMs enhanced the ability of cancer cells to migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Further, we revealed that the distant metastasis was induced by TAMs through secreting MMP-9, which induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) process through the transcription factor Snail. Further, applying proenzyme inhibitor of MMP-9 significantly enhanced the killing efficiency of chemotherapeutic drugs and reduced the lung metastasis.
CONCLUSION: Our data showed that TAMs facilitate the EMT process via an MMP-9/PI3K/AKT/Snail dependent pathway, while blocking this signaling pathway with MMP-9 proenzyme inhibitor could suppress distant metastasis in gastric cancer.",Biomed. Pharmacother.,2019,"['Liu L', 'Ye Y', 'Zhu X']",
31201065,Clinicopathological significance and prognostic implication of nuclear factor-κB activation in colorectal cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinicopathological significance of phosphorylated nuclear factor-κB (pNF-κB) expression, and its impact on epithelial-mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis in colorectal cancer (CRC).
METHODS: We carried out immunohistochemistry of pNF-κB on 261 human CRC tissues, and evaluated nuclear expression, regardless of cytoplasmic expression. We also investigated the correlation between pNF-κB expression and clinicopathological characteristics, survival, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis-related markers in CRC.
RESULTS: pNF-κB was expressed in the nuclei of 164 of the 261 CRC tissues (62.8%). Furthermore, pNF-κB was significantly correlated with frequent perineural invasion, lymph node metastasis, and higher pTNM stage. However, there was no significant correlation between pNF-κB expression and other clinicopathological parameters. Among the epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers examined, SNAIL expression was significantly correlated with pNF-κB expression (P =  0.001) but E-cadherin expression was not. CRC with pNF-κB expression had significantly higher SIRT1 expression levels and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α expression levels than CRC without pNF-κB expression (P <  0.001 and P <  0.001, respectively). However, there was no correlation between the expression levels of pNF-κB and VEGF. pNF-κB expression was significantly correlated with worse overall and recurrence-free survival rates (P <  0.001 and P <  0.001, respectively).
CONCLUSION: pNF-κB expression was significantly correlated with aggressive tumor behaviors and worse survival rates. Furthermore, pNF-κB expression may affect tumor invasion and progression through SNAIL-related epithelial-mesenchymal transition and SIRT1- and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α-induced angiogenesis.",Pathol.

31200779,"Multiplex quantitative analysis of stroma-mediated cancer cell invasion, matrix remodeling, and drug response in a 3D co-culture model of pancreatic tumor spheroids and stellate cells.","BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a stroma-rich carcinoma, and pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) are a major component of this dense stroma. PSCs play significant roles in metastatic progression and chemoresistance through cross-talk with cancer cells. Preclinical in vitro tumor model of invasive phenotype should incorporate three-dimensional (3D) culture of cancer cells and PSCs in extracellular matrix (ECM) for clinical relevance and predictability.
METHODS: PANC-1 cells were cultured as tumor spheroids (TSs) using our previously developed minipillar chips, and co-cultured with PSCs, both embedded in collagen gels. Effects of PSC co-culture on ECM fiber network, invasive migration of cancer cells, and expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins were examined. Conditioned media was also analyzed for secreted factors involved in cancer cell-PSC interactions. Inhibitory effect on cancer cell invasion was compared between gemcitabine and paclitaxel at an equitoxic concentration in PANC-1 TSs co-cultured with PSCs.
RESULTS: Co-culture condition was optimized for the growth of TSs, activation of PSCs, and their interaction. Increase in cancer cell invasion via ECM remodeling, invadopodia formation and EMT, as well as drug resistance was recapitulated in the TS-PSC co-culture, and appeared to be mediated by cancer cell-PSC interaction via multiple secreted factors, including IL-6, IL-8, IGF-1, EGF, TIMP-1, uPA, PAI-1, and TSP-1. Compared to gemcitabine, paclitaxel showed a greater anti-invasive activity, which was attributed to suppresion of invadopodia formation in cancer cells as well as to PSC-specific cytotoxicity abrogating its paracrine signaling.
CONCLUSIONS: Here, we established 3D co-culture of TSs of PANC-1 cells and PSCs using minipillar histochips as a novel tumoroid model of PDAC. Our results indicate usefulness of the present co-culture model and multiplex quantitative analysis method not only in studying the role of PSCs and their interactions with tumor cell towards metastatic progression, but also in the drug evaluation of stroma-targeting drugs.",J.

31200510,Extracellular-Signal Regulated Kinase: A Central Molecule Driving Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Cancer.,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a reversible cellular process, characterized by changes in gene expression and activation of proteins, favoring the trans-differentiation of the epithelial phenotype to a mesenchymal phenotype. This process increases cell migration and invasion of tumor cells, progression of the cell cycle, and resistance to apoptosis and chemotherapy, all of which support tumor progression. One of the signaling pathways involved in tumor progression is the MAPK pathway. Within this family, the ERK subfamily of proteins is known for its contributions to EMT. The ERK subfamily is divided into typical (ERK 1/2/5), and atypical (ERK 3/4/7/8) members. These kinases are overexpressed and hyperactive in various types of cancer. They regulate diverse cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, metastasis, resistance to chemotherapy, and EMT. In this context, in vitro and in vivo assays, as well as studies in human patients, have shown that ERK favors the expression, function, and subcellular relocalization of various proteins that regulate EMT, thus promoting tumor progression. In this review, we discuss the mechanistic roles of the ERK subfamily members in EMT and tumor progression in diverse biological systems.",Int J Mol Sci,2019,"['Olea-Flores M', 'Zuñiga-Eulogio MD', 'Mendoza-Catalán MA', 'Rodríguez-Ruiz HA', 'Castañeda-Saucedo E', 'Ortuño-Pineda C', 'Padilla-Benavides T', 'Navarro-Tito N']",
31187708,The Effect of Dihydroartemisinin on the Malignancy and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition of Gastric Cancer Cells.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to observe the effects of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) on the proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of the human gastric cancer cell line SGC7901 cultured in vitro.
METHODS: We applied varying concentrations of DHA to SGC7901 cells. Cell proliferation was measured using the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8). Flow cytometry, Transwell invasion assay, and cell scratch assay were used to investigate the cells' apoptosis, invasion, and migration. Western blot was used to assess the expression levels of EMT markers E-cadhein and Vimentin, protein kinases Akt and phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT), and the cell transcription factor Snail.
RESULTS: DHA can effectively inhibit the malignant proliferation of gastric cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In this study, with longer incubation times and increased drug concentrations, the antiproliferation effect of DHA on SGC7901 cells increased gradually (P<0.05). In addition, with the increase of drug concentration, the expression levels of E-cadhein, an epithelial-mesenchymal transition marker, remarkably increased, whereas the protein expression levels of the mesenchymal markers Vimentin, Akt, p-Akt, and Snail significantly decreased (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: DHA can effectively inhibit the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of the gastric cancer cell line SGC7901 and induce cancer cell apoptosis. DHA can also downregulate PI3K/AKT and Snail activities and inhibit the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of gastric cancer cells.

It is urgent to fully understand the development and progression of lung cancer to discover new therapeutic targets and develop new therapeutic approaches. H19 was documented to be upregulated in lung cancer and related to cell proliferation. However, it is still unclear if H19 has other functions in lung cancer. The mRNA levels of genes were detected by qRT-PCR, and the cell proliferation rate and cell viability were measured through cell count assay and MTT assay. Transwell assays were applied to detect cell abilities to migration and invasion, while luciferase reporter assay and RNA pull-down assay were used to examine interaction between H19 and miR-200a. H19 expression was elevated in the lung cancer tissues and cell lines, while H19 overexpression promoted the lung cancer cell growth, cell migration and invasion, as well as the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). Meantime, RNA pull-down assay showed that H19 interacted with miR-200a, and miR-200a inhibited the activity of H19-fused luciferase. Furthermore, H19 overexpression inhibited miR-200a function and thereby upregulated miR-200a target genes, ZEB1 and ZEB2.H19 sponged and inhibited miR-200a to de-repress expression of ZEB1 and ZEB2, and thereby enhanced lung cancer proliferation and metastasis.",Mol.

31186031,"Association of tumour-associated macrophages with cancer cell EMT, invasion, and metastasis of Kazakh oesophageal squamous cell cancer.","BACKGROUND: Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) play an important role in the growth, progression, and metastasis of tumours. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a mechanism for tumour invasion and metastasis. In this study, we aimed to determine whether TAMs can induce EMT for the invasion and metastasis of Kazakh oesophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC).
METHODS: CD163 was used as a marker for TAMs, and the density of TAMs in tumour nest and surrounding stroma was quantified using immunohistochemistry (IHC). IHC staining was used to evaluate the expression of E-cadherin (epithelial marker) and vimentin (mesenchymal marker) in Kazakh ESCC and cancer-adjacent normal tissues (CANs). Additionally, 6-well transwell plates (0.4 μm) were used to establish the co-culture system of ESCC (EC109 or EC9706) cells and macrophages. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blot experiments were used to determine whether ESCC cells undergo EMT transformation after co-culture with macrophages. Transwell assays were used to detect the migration and invasion of the ESCC cells.
RESULTS: The distribution of CD163-positive TAMs in cancer tissues was closely related to EMT in Kazakh ESCC. The expression of vimentin in the ESCC cells was significantly upregulated, the expression of E-cadherin was significantly downregulated, and the invasion and migration of the ESCC cells were significantly enhanced after tumour-associated macrophages were added to the co-culture.

31185986,Tumor suppressor role of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 2 (CPEB2) in human mammary epithelial cells.,"BACKGROUND: Over-expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 promotes breast cancer progression by multiple mechanisms, including induction of stem-like cells (SLC). Combined gene expression and microRNA microarray analyses of empty vector vs COX-2- transfected COX-2 low MCF7 breast cancer cell line identified two COX-2-upregulated microRNAs, miR-526b and miR-655, both found to be oncogenic and SLC-promoting. Cytoplasmic Polyadenylation Element-Binding Protein 2 (CPEB2) was the single common target of both microRNAs, the functions of which remain controversial. CPEB2 has multiple isoforms (A-F), and paradoxically, a high B/A ratio was reported to impart anoikis-resistance and metastatic phenotype in triple- negative breast cancer cells. We tested whether CPEB2 is a tumor suppressor in mammary epithelial cells.
METHODS: We knocked-out CPEB2 in the non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A by CRISPR/Cas9-double nickase approach, and knocked-down CPEB2 with siRNAs in the poorly malignant MCF7 cell line, both lines being high CPEB2-expressing. The resultant phenotypes for oncogenity were tested in vitro for both lines and in vivo for CPEB2KO cells. Finally, CPEB2 expression was compared between human breast cancer and non-tumor breast tissues.
RESULTS: CPEB2 (isoform A) expression was inversely correlated with COX-2 or the above microRNAs in COX-2-divergent breast cancer cell lines. CPEB2KO MCF10A cells exhibited oncogenic properties including increased proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT (decreased E-Cadherin, increased Vimentin, N-Cadherin, SNAI1, and ZEB1) and SLC phenotype (increased tumorsphere formation and SLC marker-expression). Tumor-suppressor p53 protein was shown to be a novel translationally-regulated target of CPEB2, validated with polysome profiling. CPEB2KO, but not wild-type cells produced lung colonies upon intravenous injection and subcutaneous tumors and spontaneous lung metastases upon implantation at mammary sites in NOD/SCID/IL2Rϒ-null mice, identified with HLA immunostaining. Similarly, siRNA-mediated CPEB2 knockdown in MCF7 cells promoted oncogenic properties in vitro. Human breast cancer tissues (n = 105) revealed a lower mRNA expression for CPEB2 isoform A and also a lower A/B isoform ratio than in non-tumour breast tissues (n = 20), suggesting that CPEB2A accounts for the tumor-suppressor functions of CPEB2.
CONCLUSIONS: CPEB2, presumably the isoform A, plays a key role in suppressing tumorigenesis in mammary epithelial cells by repressing EMT, migration, invasion, proliferation and SLC phenotype, via multiple targets, including a newly-identified translational target p53.",BMC Cancer,2019,"['Tordjman J', 'Majumder M', 'Amiri M', 'Hasan A', 'Hess D', 'Lala PK']",

Resveratrol (Res) as a phytochemical in grapes and red wine has diverse biological effects such as anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation and anti-cancer. CXCR4 as a chemokine receptor has been found to be upregulated in cancer metastasis and has been used as a prognostic marker in various types of cancer, including leukemia, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. In this study, we focused on the role of DHT in the induction of prostate cancer progression by affecting the AR and CXCR4 pathway. Also, we investigated the inhibition effect of resveratrol on DHT-induced prostate cancer metastasis. In cell viability assay, DHT increased the cell viability of LNCaP prostate cancer cells, on the other hand, Res and its combination with bicalutamide (BCT) as an AR-antagonist or AMD3100 as a CXCR4 inhibitor significantly reduced the cell viability promoted by DHT. Trans-well migration assay and wound healing assay represented the similar results with cell viability assay. According to the results of TUNEL assay, the apoptotic activity was induced by treatment of Res. As results of western blot analysis, the expression of AR, CXCR4, p-PI3K, and p-AKT and the downstream genes related with cell cycle progression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were decreased and the expression of the apoptosis-related genes was increased by treatment of Res and its combination with BCT or AMD3100.

31182136,PLEK2 promotes gallbladder cancer invasion and metastasis through EGFR/CCL2 pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is an extremely malignant tumor with a high mortality rate. Little is known about its invasion and metastasis mechanism so far.
METHODS: To identify the driver genes in GBC metastasis, we performed a mRNA microarray of metastatic GBC and paired non-tumor samples, and found PLEK2 was markedly upregulated in GBC tissues. Next, the expression of PLEK2 in GBC were examined in a larger cohort of patients by qRT-PCR, western blot and IHC staining. The clinicopathologic correlation of PLEK2 was determined by statistical analyses. The biological involvement of PLEK2 in GBC metastasis and the underlying mechanisms were investigated.
RESULTS: In this study, we found that PLEK2 had higher expression in GBC tumor tissues compared to non-cancerous adjacent tissues and cholecystolithiasis tissues. The clinicopathologic analyses showed PLEK2 expression was positively correlated with tumor TNM stage, distant metastasis and PLEK2 was an independent predictor of overall survival (OS) in GBC patients. The cellular function assays showed PLEK2 promoted GBC cells migration, invasion and liver metastasis in mouse model via the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Our mass spectrum and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays demonstrated that PLEK2 could interact with the kinase domain of EGFR and suppress EGFR ubiquitination mediated by c-CBL, leading to constitutive activation of EGFR signaling. Furthermore, RNA-sequencing and qRT-PCR results demonstrated chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), a target gene downstream of PLEK2/EGFR signaling, mediated the motility-promoting function of PLEK2.
CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these collective data, we propose that PLEK2 promotes the invasion and metastasis of GBC by EGFR/CCL2 pathway and PLEK2 can serve as a potential therapeutic target for GBC treatment.",J.

31182131,Targeting the SPOCK1-snail/slug axis-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by apigenin contributes to repression of prostate cancer metastasis.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is considered one of the most prevalent malignancy globally, and metastasis is a major cause of death. Apigenin (API) is a dietary flavonoid which exerts an antimetastatic effect in various cancer types. Sparc/osteonectin, cwcv, and kazal-like domains proteoglycan 1 (SPOCK1) is a crucial modulator of tumor growth and metastasis in cancers. However, the role and underlying regulatory mechanisms of SPOCK1 in the API-mediated antimetastatic effects of PCa remain unclear.
METHODS: MTS, colony formation, wound-healing, and transwell assays were conducted to evaluate the effects of API on PCa cell proliferative, migratory, and invasive potentials. In vivo orthotopic bioluminescent xenograft model were employed to determine antitumor activity of API. PCa cells were transfected with either Snail-, Slug-, SPOCK1-overexpressing vector, or small hairpin (sh)SPOCK1 to determine the invasive abilities and expression levels of SPOCK1 and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) biomarkers in response to API treatment. Immunohistochemical (IHC) assays were carried out to evaluate the expression level of SPOCK1 in PCa xenografts and a PCa tissue array. Associations of SPOCK1 expression with clinicopathological features and prognoses of patients with PCa were analyzed by GEO or TCGA RNA-sequencing data.
RESULTS: API significantly suppressed in vitro PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and inhibited in vivo PCa tumor growth and metastasis. Moreover, survival times of animals were also prolonged after API treatment. Mechanistic studies revealed that API treatment resulted in downregulation of SPOCK1, which was accompanied by reduced expressions of mesenchymal markers and subsequent attenuation of invasive abilities of PCa cells. Overexpression of SPOCK1 in PCa xenografts resulted in significant promotion of tumor progression and relieved the anticancer activities induced by API, whereas knockdown of SPOCK1 had opposite effects. In clinical, SPOCK1 levels were higher in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues, which was also significantly correlated with shorter disease-free survival in PCa patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Levels of SPOCK1 increase with the progression of human PCa which suggests that SPOCK1 may act as a prognostic marker or therapeutic target for patients with PCa. Suppression of SPOCK1-mediated EMT signaling contributes to the antiproliferative and antimetastatic activities of API in vitro and in vivo.",J. Exp. Clin.

31182056,Deletion of sorting nexin 27 suppresses proliferation in highly aggressive breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro and in vivo.,"BACKGROUND: Sorting Nexin 27 (SNX27) belongs to a family of sortin nexins and possesses a unique binding domain at the C-terminus which mediates protein-protein interaction in intracellular trafficking, membrane remodeling, organelle motility, and tight junctions. However, its role in cancer development, especially in vivo, remains largely unknown.
METHODS: We have generated a stable SNX27 knockdown clone in a highly aggressive breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 using an inducible lentiviral shRNA system. Cell migration and proliferation of SNX27 knockdown (KD) cells were compared with wild-type (WT) cells by MTT and wound healing assay, respectively. The differences in colony formation between SNX27-KD and WT cells were detected by soft agar culture and matrigel 3D culture. Furthermore, tumor growth was examined in a xenograft nude mouse model using SNX27-KD and WT MDA-MB-231 cells. The critical EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) regulators were examined in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: The wound healing assay showed that SNX27 knockdown significantly decreased cell motility and proliferation. Colony formation in soft agar showed that the SNX27 knockdown cells formed significantly fewer and smaller colonies than the parental MDA-MB-231 cells. Western blots and immunostaining showed that knockdown of SNX27 led to increased expression of E-cadherin and β-catenin proteins, which facilitate adhesion formation and reverse EMT. EMT is a cellular program that allows polarized, immotile epithelial cells to convert to motile mesenchymal cells, promoting carcinoma invasion. The expression levels of Vimentin, the transcription factor of EMT, and tight junction protein Claudin-5, were significantly diminished in the SNX27 knockdown cells. The expression of PCNA, the cell proliferation marker, was increased in SNX27-KD cells transfected with E-cadherin siRNA. In a xenograft nude mouse model, we found that knockdown of SNX27 significantly inhibited tumor growth. The tumors from mice with SNX27-KD cells showed less proliferation compared to tumors from mice injected with wildtype cells. The increase in E-cadherin and β-catenin and decrease in Vimentin and Claudin-5 were observed in tumors of mice injected with SNX27-KD cells.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the expression levels of amyloid β precursor protein (APP) are increased in NPC. The present study aimed to investigate the association between APP and the development of NPC. In order to knockdown APP expression, an APP‑small interfering RNA vector was synthesized and transfected into SUNE‑1 cells. Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay was performed to assess cell viability. The migratory and invasive abilities of SUNE‑1 cells were examined by wound healing and Transwell assays, respectively. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were performed to measure the mRNA and protein expression levels of APP, and additional factors involved in epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) and in the mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. APP silencing significantly suppressed cell viability, migration and invasion. In addition, APP interference downregulated the expression levels of metastasis‑associated 1, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)‑2 and MMP‑9; however, knockdown of APP led to upregulation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 and inhibited EMT. The phosphorylation levels of p38, extracellular signal‑-regulated kinases 1/2 and c‑Jun N‑terminal kinases 1/2 were decreased following downregulation of APP. The present results suggested that APP knockdown may significantly inhibit the development of NPC by suppressing cell viability, migration and invasion, and by inhibiting the EMT process via downregulation of the MAPK signaling pathway. Therefore, APP may facilitate the development of a novel gene therapy for the treatment of NPC.",Mol Med Rep,2019,"['Xu J', 'Ying Y', 'Xiong G', 'Lai L', 'Wang Q', 'Yang Y']",

The aim of this study was to determine whether melatonin inhibits lung metastasis in gastric cancer.
MAIN METHODS: A lung metastasis model of gastric cancer was established in nude mice injected with human gastric adenocarcinoma MGC80-3 cells. Mice were divided into control, IL-1β-treated, melatonin-treated, and IL-1β plus melatonin-treated groups and analyzed for the formation of lung metastatic nodules by flow cytometry and hematoxylin and eosin staining. The mRNA expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers was assessed by RT-qPCR.

The levels of NF-κB p65 and phosphorylated (p)-p65 were detected by immunohistochemistry.
KEY FINDINGS: The number of lung metastases in the IL-1β plus melatonin group was significantly lower and the sizes of nodules were smaller than those in the IL-1β group. Furthermore, melatonin reversed changes in the expression of EMT markers induced by IL-1β by increasing mRNA levels of β-catenin and E-cadherin and decreasing those of fibronectin, vimentin, and Snail compared to IL-1β. Treatment with IL-1β upregulated the expression and activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and expression of NF-κB p65 and phospho-p65 (p-p65), but melatonin alleviated these effects.
SIGNIFICANCE: Melatonin inhibited IL-1β-induced lung metastasis of gastric cancer through downregulation of MMP-2, MMP-9, and NF-κB p65 expression and activities. These findings provide a basis for potential use of melatonin as a supplementary therapy for patients with advanced gastric cancer.",Biomed.

31174404,Insights on CTC Biology and Clinical Impact Emerging from Advances in Capture Technology.,"Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating tumor microemboli (CTM) have been shown to correlate negatively with patient survival. Actual CTC counts before and after treatment can be used to aid in the prognosis of patient outcomes. The presence of circulating tumor materials (CTMat) can advertise the presence of metastasis before clinical presentation, enabling the early detection of relapse. Importantly, emerging evidence is indicating that cancer treatments can actually increase the incidence of CTCs and metastasis in pre-clinical models. Subsequently, the study of CTCs, their biology and function are of vital importance. Emerging technologies for the capture of CTC/CTMs and CTMat are elucidating vitally important biological and functional information that can lead to important alterations in how therapies are administered.

31174324,Methylglyoxal Acts as a Tumor-Promoting Factor in Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer.,"Methylglyoxal (MG) is a potent inducer of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). MG, long considered a highly cytotoxic molecule with potential anticancer value, is now being re-evaluated to a protumorigenic agent in some malignancies. Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is an extremely aggressive and highly lethal cancer for which conventional therapies have proved ineffective. Successful therapeutic intervention in ATC is undermined by our poor understanding of its molecular etiology. In the attempt to understand the role of MG in ATC aggressiveness, we used immunohistochemistry to examine the level of MG protein adducts in ATC and slow-growing papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). We detected a high level of MG adducts in ATC compared to PTC ones, suggesting a protumor role for MG-mediated dicarbonyl stress in ATC. Accordingly, MG adduct accumulation in ATC cells in vitro was associated with a marked mesenchymal phenotype and increased migration/invasion, which were both reversed by aminoguanidine (AG)-a scavenger of MG-and resveratrol-an activator of Glyoxalase 1 (Glo1), the key metabolizing enzyme of MG. Our study represents the first demonstration that MG, via AGEs, acts as a tumor-promoting factor in ATC and suggests that MG scavengers and/or Glo1 activators merit investigations as potential therapeutic strategies for this malignancy.",Cells,2019,"['Antognelli C', 'Moretti S', 'Frosini R', 'Puxeddu E', 'Sidoni A', 'Talesa VN']",
31173238,miR‑379 inhibits cell proliferation and epithelial‑mesenchymal transition by targeting CHUK through the NF‑κB pathway in non‑small cell lung cancer.,"An increasing body of evidence has demonstrated that microRNA (miR) deregulation serves pivotal roles in tumor progression and metastasis. However, the function of miR‑379 in lung cancer remains understudied, particularly in non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Bioinformatics and luciferase reporter analyses confirmed that conserved helix‑loop‑helix ubiquitous kinase (CHUK) is a target of miR‑379, which may directly bind to the 3'‑untranslated region of CHUK and significantly downregulate its expression in NSCLC cells. Transwell assays were used to evaluate the role of miR‑379 in cell migration and invasion, and western blotting was used to address the association between miR‑379 and epithelial‑mesenchymal markers, including E‑cadherin, cytokeratin and Vimentin. In the present study, miR‑379 expression in NSCLC tissues and cell lines was downregulated, which may be associated with the poor survival of patients with NSCLC. miR‑379 may act as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC, potentially by suppressing cell growth and proliferation, delaying G1‑S transition, enhancing cell apoptosis and suppressing NSCLC cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, it was also observed that CHUK may function as an oncogene, and downregulation of CHUK induced by miR‑379 may partially rescue the malignant characteristics of tumors, indicating that miR‑379 may be suppressed in tumorigenesis. The overexpression of miR‑379 may prevent the growth of NSCLC tumors via CHUK suppression and the downstream nuclear factor‑κB pathway. The results of the present study demonstrated that miR‑379 may act as a tumor suppressor, and may constitute a potential biomarker and a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment for NSCLC.",Mol Med Rep,2019,"['Liu B', 'Wang Z', 'Cheng S', 'Du L', 'Yin Y', 'Yang Z', 'Zhou J']",
31173226,UBE2T promotes proliferation and regulates PI3K/Akt signaling in renal cell carcinoma.,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a common malignant tumor globally. The overall survival of patients with RCC is poor; one important factor is tumor heterogeneity. Ubiquitin‑conjugating enzyme E2T (UBE2T) has been reported to act as an oncogene in various types of cancer; however, its role in RCC has yet to be investigated. In the present study, UBE2T was demonstrated via reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR analysis to be significantly upregulated in RCC samples and cell lines compared with in normal tissue and cells. Additionally, UBE2T expression was significantly associated with late tumor stage and high grade in patients with RCC, and patients with high UBE2T expression exhibited poor prognosis compared with patients with low expression. Following knockdown of UBE2T in 786‑O cells using RNA interference technology, the proliferation and colony formation of cells were inhibited as determined by an MTT assay and crystal violet staining, respectively; however, the migration and invasion of 786‑O cells were not affected, as determined by wound‑healing assay and Transwell assays, respectively. Xenograft RCC tumor growth in vivo was also significantly suppressed. The expression levels of two mesenchymal cell markers, N‑cadherin and vimentin, were reduced following UBE2T knockdown, whereas E‑cadherin and fibronectin levels were increased as determined by western blotting, indicating that epithelial‑mesenchymal transition was suppressed. In addition, the phosphorylation levels of PI3K, Akt and mTOR were notably decreased following UBE2T knockdown, but were increased when UBE2T was overexpressed. Wortmannin, an Akt inhibitor, reversed the UBE2T overexpression‑induced increase in the phosphorylation of PI3K, Akt and mTOR. Similarly, the UBE2T overexpression‑induced promotion of 786‑O cell proliferation was also attenuated by wortmannin. In conclusion, UBE2T promoted the proliferation of RCC cells by regulating PI3K/Akt signaling, suggesting it may be a novel target for the treatment of patients with RCC.",Mol Med Rep,2019,"['Hao P', 'Kang B', 'Li Y', 'Hao W', 'Ma F']",

Here, we investigated the antimetastatic potential of theacrine on human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. We observed that theacrine can reverse epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which resulted in a decrease in the levels of mesenchymal markers (Fibronectin, Vimentin, N-cadherin, Twist, and Snail) and an increase in the levels of epithelial markers (Occludin and E-cadherin) in the cells. Additionally, theacrine attenuates TGF-β-induced EMT, cell adhesion, migration, and invasion in MDA-MB-231 cells.

AIM: To investigate the prognostic value of LVI in CRC and identify the associated genomic alterations.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 1219 CRC patients and evaluated the prognostic value of LVI for overall survival by the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox regression analysis. We also performed an array-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis of 47 fresh CRC samples to examine the genomic alterations associated with LVI. A decision tree model was applied to identify special DNA copy number alterations (DCNAs) for differentiating between CRCs with and without LVI. Functional enrichment and protein-protein interaction network analyses were conducted to explore the potential molecular mechanisms of LVI.
RESULTS: LVI was detected in 150 (12.3%) of 1219 CRCs, and the presence was positively associated with higher histological grade and advanced tumor stage (both

METHODS: Primary pancreatic tumor (n = 185) cohort in The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene set enrichment analysis were used.
RESULTS: There were no significant associations between ANXA2 expression and clinicopathologic features of the patients investigated. The ANXA2 high tumors enriched some of the known downstream signaling, such as NF-κB (P = .028) and tumor necrosis factor (P = .044) pathways, whereas others, such as angiogenesis or epithelial-mesenchymal transition, were not associated.

However, little is known about the functional roles of CLCA4 in colorectal cancer (CRC). MATERIAL AND METHODS In this study, the expression patterns and dysregulation of mRNAs in CRC tissues were profiled by analyzing GSE21510 datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus database which contains 104 primary hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and 24 normal liver tissues, and by performing Kaplan-Meier analysis of TCGA data. Additionally, immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were performed using clinical tissues collected at our institute. In order to explore the functional role of CLCA4, gain-of-function cell models were constructed in SW620 and LoVo cells. Wound healing assay and Transwell assay were carried out to access the cell migration and invasion ability. RESULTS It was found that CLCA4 was an independent predictor for overall survival and lymph node metastasis. Additionally, immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR results of the clinical tissues collected as part of our study further confirmed this correlation. In vitro experiments demonstrated that over-expression of CLCA4 could inhibit cell migration and invasion by suppressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via PI3K/ATK signaling and change the expression patterns of EMT markers in CLCA4-gain-of-function cell models. CONCLUSIONS CLCA4 inhibits migration and invasion by suppressing EMT via PI3K/ATK signaling and predicts favorable prognosis of CRC which may help to distinguish potential risk of lymph node metastasis in CRC.",Med.

However, the nature of the interactions between CagA and KLF4 in GC development has not been elucidated. Therefore, we focused on the CagA-mediated promotion of the malignant transformation of gastric epithelial cells. Herein, we first examined the expression of KLF4 in both human cancer and paracarcinoma tissues with or without H. pylori infection and found that KLF4 expression was significantly decreased in H. pylori-positive GC cells compared with the H. pylori-negative GC cells. Further functional studies revealed that the increased expression of CagA could suppress KLF4 expression and promote the malignant transformation of normal epithelial cells. Subsequently, we found that CagA could upregulate miR-155 and further restrict the expression of downstream KLF4. More importantly, the overexpression of miR-155 in GES-1 promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition and eventually facilitated tumor growth in vivo. Overall, the identification of the CagA/miR-155/KLF4 signaling pathway provided a new insight into the development and treatment of GC.",Mol.

31160270,The circRNA circPTPRA suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal transitioning and metastasis of NSCLC cells by sponging miR-96-5p.,"BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) are prevalent, lethal cancers with especially grim prospects due to late-stage detection and chemoresistance. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that participate in tumor development. However, the role of circRNAs in NSCLC is not well known. This study investigated the role of one circRNA - circPTPRA- in NSCLC and characterized its molecular mechanism of action.
METHODS: circPTPRA expression was analyzed in human NSCLC tumors and matched healthy lung tissue. We performed functional characterization in NSCLC cell lines and a mouse xenograft model of NSCLC to elucidate the molecular role of circPTPRA in epithelial-mesenchymal transitioning (EMT). We also assessed the regulatory action of circPTPRA on the microRNA miR-96-5p and its target the tumor suppressor Ras association domain-containing protein 8 (RASSF8).
FINDINGS: circPTPRA was significantly downregulated in NSCLC tumors relative to matched healthy lung tissue. Lower circPTPRA levels correlated with metastasis and inferior survival outcomes in NSCLC patients. circPTPRA suppressed EMT in NSCLC cell lines and reduced metastasis in the murine xenograft model by sequestering miR-96-5p and upregulating RASSF8. Correlation analyses in patient-derived NSCLC tumor specimens supported the involvement of the circPTPRA/miR-96-5p/RASSF8/E-cadherin axis dysregulation in NSCLC tumor progression.
INTERPRETATION: circPTPRA suppresses EMT and metastasis of NSCLC cell lines by sponging miR-96-5p, which upregulates the downstream tumor suppressor RASSF8. The circPTPRA/miR-96-5p/RASSF8/E-cadherin axis can be leveraged as a potential treatment avenue in NSCLC.

31159744,Comprehensive functional profiling of long non-coding RNAs through a novel pan-cancer integration approach and modular analysis of their protein-coding gene association networks.,"BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as crucial regulators of cellular processes in diseases such as cancer, although the functions of most remain poorly understood. To address this, here we apply a novel strategy to integrate gene expression profiles across 32 cancer types, and cluster human lncRNAs based on their pan-cancer protein-coding gene associations. By doing so, we derive 16 lncRNA modules whose unique properties allow simultaneous inference of function, disease specificity and regulation for over 800 lncRNAs.
RESULTS: Remarkably, modules could be grouped into just four functional themes: transcription regulation, immunological, extracellular, and neurological, with module generation frequently driven by lncRNA tissue specificity. Notably, three modules associated with the extracellular matrix represented potential networks of lncRNAs regulating key events in tumour progression. These included a tumour-specific signature of 33 lncRNAs that may play a role in inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition through modulation of TGFβ signalling, and two stromal-specific modules comprising 26 lncRNAs linked to a tumour suppressive microenvironment and 12 lncRNAs related to cancer-associated fibroblasts. One member of the 12-lncRNA signature was experimentally supported by siRNA knockdown, which resulted in attenuated differentiation of quiescent fibroblasts to a cancer-associated phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the study provides a unique pan-cancer perspective on the lncRNA functional landscape, acting as a global source of novel hypotheses on lncRNA contribution to tumour progression.",BMC Genomics,2019,"['Walters K', 'Sarsenov R', 'Too WS', 'Hare RK', 'Paterson IC', 'Lambert DW', 'Brown S', 'Bradford JR']",

In this study, the metastatic properties of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells were evaluated by morphological examination, wound healing assay, migration and invasion assay. Western blotting and qRT-PCR were used to ascertain the expression of markers which were associated with EMT. The effects of miR-205-5p on invasion, migration, EMT and proliferation of NPC cells were evaluated and the molecular mechanisms of their interaction were explored. In this study, we manifested firstly that the expression of miR-205-5p in cisplatin-resistant NPC cell line HNE1/DDP was obviously up-regulated than that in its parental cell line HNE1. Then we analyzed the specific role of miR-205-5p through functional assays by transfecting specific mimics and inhibitors. The results indicated that low expression of miR-205-5p restrained EMT progression of HNE1/DDP cells. Further studies on the mechanism of miR-205-5p manifested that PTEN was a downstream candidate gene of miR-205-5p, down-regulated PTEN expression could counteract the effect of miR-205-5p inhibitors, and the regulation of EMT by miR-205-5p on HNE1/DDP cells depended on the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.

31158427,Linkage between EMT and stemness state through molecular association between TWIST1 and NY-ESO1 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,"Aberrant expression of cancer testis antigens (CTAs) is reported in tumors, especially those with stemness properties. A number of CTAs can induce epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) process and promote cancer stem cells (CSCs) characteristics. We aimed in this study to analyze the correlation between NY-ESO1 and TWIST1 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), as well as their impact on EMT process. Gene expression profiling of NY-ESO1 and TWIST1 was performed in 43 esophageal tumors compared to their margin normal tissues of using qRT-PCR, and their correlation with clinicopathological variables of the patients was evaluated. In silico analysis of the NY-ESO1, epithelial and mesenchymal cell markers and also their promoter sequences was executed. ESCC cell lines KYSE-30 and YM-1 were transduced to ectopically express TWIST1 using a retroviral system, followed by qRT-PCR mRNA expression analysis to reveal the probable correlation among TWIST1, NY-ESO1 and EMT markers gene expression. Scratch assay was performed to estimate migration of TWIST1-induced cells. Overexpression of TWIST1 and NY-ESO1 mRNA was observed in 42% and 39.5% (P ˂ 0.05) of tumors, respectively. Expression of the genes was significantly correlated with each other (p = 0.005). TWIST1 and NY-ESO1 overexpression was significantly associated with stage of progression and size of tumors, respectively. A direct association between TWIST1 and NY-ESO1 mRNA expression was confirmed by induced ectopic expression of TWIST1 in ESCC cell lines KYSE-30 and YM-1. TWIST1-induced cells led to increase migration in ESCC cell line. Furthermore, significant up-regulation of EMT markers was observed following ectopic expression of TWIST1 in these cells. Based on our findings, it may be proposed that a vital association is exist between the EMT and the acquisition of cancer stemness state in tumor cells through the TWIST1/NY-ESO1 axis and it can be a critical hallmark in ESCC tumorigenesis.",Biochimie,2019,"['Ardalan Khales S', 'Abbaszadegan MR', 'Majd A', 'Forghanifard MM']",

Our present study indicates that TNFAIP3 is required for the ubiquitination degradation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) related transcription factors Snail and ZEB1, which further altered the expression of EMT-related marker proteins and eventually contributing to the malignant phenotype and poorer prognosis of gastric carcinoma. Depletion of TNFAIP3 attenuated the capacity of proliferation, migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells in vitro.

However, the functional roles of HCRP1 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of HCRP1 on ESCC cells and the underlying mechanism. Our results demonstrated that HCRP1 was lowly expressed in ESCC tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of HCRP1 significantly suppressed ESCC cell proliferation and invasion as well as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Furthermore, HCRP1 increased the sensitivity of ESCC cells towards cisplatin/fluorouracil. Mechanistically, HCRP1 inhibited the activity of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in ESCC cells. In conclusion, these findings indicated that HCRP1 suppressed ESCC cell proliferation and invasion through regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

MicroRNA plays a significant role in the regulation of EMT through tight control of the transcription factors. In this study, we focus on miR-200a/205 as a factor involved in the control of the EMT process in gastric cancer cells. In this sense, gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines were used to induce EMT process. For characterization of EMT process, the mRNA levels of E-cadherin, Vimentin, β-catenin, ZEB1 and Snail were measured by real time PCR. In addition, Western blot approach was adopted to determine the protein levels of these EMT markers. Transwell assay revealed migration and invasion property of gastric cancer cell after EMT induction. To analyze alteration amount of microRNAs, RT-PCR was applied. Our results confirmed the establishment of in vitro EMT model. In vitro study showed a significant negative correlation between the expression of miR-200a (P = 0.001) and expression level of EMT markers. Nevertheless, miR-205 did not show any significant results in correlation with EMT in AGS cell line. All in vitro results also were validated in gastric cancer tissue samples. Based on our findings from gastric cancer sample patients and in vitro results, miR-200a is down regulated.

Here, by using a cDNA microarray, we demonstrated that extracellular ATP could stimulate hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling and upregulate hypoxia-inducible factor 1/2α (HIF-1/2α) expression. After knocking down HIF-1/2α using siRNA, we found that ATP-driven invasion and EMT were significantly attenuated via HIF2A-siRNA in breast cancer cells. By using ChIP assays, we revealed that the biological function of extracellular ATP in invasion and EMT process depended on HIF-2α direct targets, among which lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) mediated ATP-driven invasion, and E-cadherin and Snail mediated ATP-driven EMT, respectively. In addition, using silver staining and mass spectrometry, we found that phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) could interact with HIF-2α and mediate ATP-driven HIF-2α upregulation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that expressions of HIF-2α and its target proteins could be regulated via ATP by AKT-PGK1 pathway. Using a Balb/c mice model, we illustrated the function of HIF-2α in promoting tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Moreover, by exploring online databases, we found that molecules involved in ATP-HIF-2α signaling were highly expressed in human breast carcinoma tissues and were associated with poor prognosis. Altogether, these findings suggest that extracellular ATP could promote breast carcinoma invasion and EMT via HIF-2α signaling, which may be a potential target for future anti-metastasis therapy.",Cancer Sci.,2019,"['Yang H', 'Geng YH', 'Wang P', 'Zhou YT', 'Yang H', 'Huo YF', 'Zhang HQ', 'Li Y', 'He HY', 'Tian XX', 'Fang WG']",

However, the mechanisms that underpin the activity of RBM4 in gastric cancer (GC) remain unknown. The purpose of our study was to explore how RBM4 affects the biological behavior of GC through in vivo and in vitro experiments. MATERIAL AND METHODS Western blot and flow cytometry analyses were used to investigate the RBM4 protein levels in normal gastric epithelial cells and 5 types of GC cells. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, flow cytometry analysis, wound-healing, and migration and invasion assays were evaluated in vitro in BGC823 and MGC803 GC cells. A xenograft tumor model was used to assess whether RBM4 inhibits GC growth in vivo. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) protein levels were determined using western blot analyses. RESULTS Our study revealed that RBM4 protein was downregulated in GC cells. Re-expression of RBM4 inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GC cells, while promoting apoptosis. Thus, the overexpression of RBM4 can inhibit tumor growth in GC mouse models. We also report that RBM4 was involved in the activation of MAPK-dependent signaling pathways in human GC.

31141946,Gastric Cancer Extracellular Vesicles Tune the Migration and Invasion of Epithelial and Mesenchymal Cells in a Histotype-Dependent Manner.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by tumor cells modulate recipient cells' behavior, but their effects in normal cells from the tumor microenvironment remain poorly known. In this study, we dissected the functional impact of gastric cancer cell-derived EVs (GC-EVs), representative of distinct GC histotypes, on the behavior of normal isogenic epithelial and mesenchymal cells. GC-EVs were isolated by differential centrifugation and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and imaging flow-cytometry. Epithelial and mesenchymal cells were challenged with GC-EVs and submitted to proliferation, migration, and invasion assays. Expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers was followed by immunofluorescence and flow-cytometry. Our results indicated that GC-EVs secreted by diffuse-type cancer cells decrease the migration of recipient cells. This effect was more prominent and persistent for mesenchymal recipient cells, which also increased Fibronectin expression in response to EVs. GC-EVs secreted by cancer cells derived from tumors with an intestinal component increased invasion of recipient epithelial cells, without changes in EMT markers. In summary, this study demonstrated that GC-EVs modulate the migration and invasion of epithelial and mesenchymal cells from the tumor microenvironment, in a histotype-dependent manner, highlighting new features of intestinal and diffuse-type GC cells, which may help explaining differential metastasis patterns and aggressiveness of GC histotypes.",Int J Mol Sci,2019,"['Rocha S', 'Teles SP', 'Azevedo M', 'Oliveira P', 'Carvalho J', 'Oliveira C']",
31141251,Exosomes containing ErbB2/CRK induce vascular growth in premetastatic niches and promote metastasis of bladder cancer.,"Locally advanced and metastatic invasive bladder cancer (BC) has a poor prognosis, and no advanced therapies beyond cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy have been developed. Therefore, it is an urgent issue to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of tumor progression and metastasis of invasive BC for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Here, we clarified a novel role of exosomes containing ErbB2 and CRK in a formation of premetastatic niches and subsequent metastases. CRK adaptors were overexpressed in invasive UM-UC-3 BC cells. In an orthotopic xenograft model, metastases to lung, liver, and bone of UM-UC-3 cells were completely abolished by CRK elimination. Mass spectrometry analysis identified that ErbB2 was contained in UM-UC-3-derived exosomes in a CRK-dependent manner; the exosomes significantly increased proliferation and invasion properties of low-grade 5637 BC cells and HUVECs through FAK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. In athymic mice educated with UM-UC-3-derived exosomes, i.v. implanted UM-UC-3 cells were trapped with surrounding PKH67-labeled exosomes in lung and led to development of lung metastasis with disordered vascular proliferation. In contrast, exosomes derived from CRK-depleted BC cells failed to induce these malignant features. Taken together, we showed that CRK adaptors elevated the expression of ErbB2/3 in BC cells, and these tyrosine kinase/adaptor units were transferred from host BC cells to metastatic recipient cells by exosomes, leading to vascular leakiness and proliferation and contributing to the formation of distant metastasis. Thus, CRK intervention with ErbB2/3 blockade might be a potent therapeutic strategy for patients with ErbB2 overexpressing advanced and metastatic BC.",Cancer Sci.,2019,"['Yoshida K', 'Tsuda M', 'Matsumoto R', 'Semba S', 'Wang L', 'Sugino H', 'Tanino M', 'Kondo T', 'Tanabe K', 'Tanaka S']",
31140103,"LIN28A-stabilized FBXL19-AS1 promotes breast cancer migration, invasion and EMT by regulating WDR66.","Breast cancer ranks as the top reason for the oncologic mortality for female around the world. The occurrence rate of breast cancer is rapidly rising, especially in China. Although the therapeutic regimes for breast cancer are diverse, the treatment outcome in patients remains dismal. Long non-coding RNAs have been greatly reported as important participators in cancer progression during the past decades. FBXL19 antisense RNA 1 (FBXL19-AS1) has been identified as a novel oncogene in colorectal cancer recently, but its role in breast cancer remains unknown. Present study attempted to explore the functional role and mechanism of FBXL19-AS1 in breast cancer progression. Expression of FBXL19-AS1, lin-28 homolog A (LIN28A), and WD repeat domain 66 (WDR66) were detected by qPCR and Western blotting. Transwell assay was used to detect cell migration and invasion. RIP assay was used to examine interaction between LIN28A and FBXL19-AS1. First, FBXL19-AS1 was highly expressed in breast cancer cell lines. Loss-of-function assays indicated that FBXL19-AS1 promoted cell migration, invasion, and EMT in breast cancer. Mechanistically, FBXL19-AS1 interacted with and was stabilized by LIN28A, an RNA-binding protein which has been reported to be able to stabilize lncRNAs. Moreover, WDR66 expression was promoted by FBXL19-AS1 at mRNA and protein level. Finally, rescue assays suggested that FBXL19-AS1 promoted migration, invasion, and EMT through regulating WDR66 in breast cancer. Current study proved that LIN28A-stabilized FBXL19-AS1 promoted breast cancer metastasis by regulating WDR66, identifying FBXL19-AS1 as a new biological marker in breast cancer.",In Vitro Cell. Dev.

31138318,The TGFβ-miR-499a-SHKBP1 pathway induces resistance to EGFR inhibitors in osteosarcoma cancer stem cell-like cells.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: A novel paradigm in tumor biology suggests that osteosarcoma (OS) chemo-resistance is driven by osteosarcoma stem cell-like cells (OSCs). As the sensitivity of only a few tumors to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can be explained by the presence of EGFR tyrosine kinase (TK) domain mutations, there is a need to elucidate mechanisms of resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies in OS that do not harbor TK sensitizing mutations to develop new strategies to circumvent resistance to EGFR inhibitors.
METHODS: As a measure of the characters of OSCs, serum-free cultivation, cell viability test with erlotinib, and serial transplantation in vivo was used. Western blot assays were used to detect the association between erlotinib resistance and transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ)-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression. By using TaqMan qPCR miRNA array, online prediction software, luciferase reporter assays and western blot analysis, we further elucidated the mechanisms.
RESULTS: Here, CD166

The perturbations of miR-21 also dramatically reduces or increases epithelial to mesenschymal transition (EMT). We show that regulation of proliferation and EMT are directed by PTEN/Akt/GSK3 beta signaling axis by regulating the expression of invasion markers including E-cadherin, vimentin, snail, slug and beta-catenin.

31134496,Heterogeneity and Plasticity of Breast Cancer Stem Cells.,"In the last 20 years, the conventional view of breast cancer as a homogeneous collection of highly proliferating malignant cells was totally replaced by a model of increased complexity, which points out that breast carcinomas are tissues composed of multiple populations of transformed cells. A large diversity of host cells and structural components of the extracellular matrix constitute the mammary tumour microenvironment, which supports its growth and progression, where individual cancer cells evolve with cumulative phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. Moreover, contributing to this heterogeneity, it has been demonstrated that breast cancers can exhibit a hierarchical organization composed of tumour cells displaying divergent lineage biomarkers and where, at the apex of this hierarchy, some neoplastic cells are able to self-renew and to aberrantly differentiate. Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), as they were entitled, not only drive tumourigenesis, but also mediate metastasis and contribute to therapy resistance.Recently, adding more complexity to the system, it has been demonstrated that BCSCs maintain high levels of plasticity, being able to change between mesenchymal-like and epithelial-like states in a process regulated by the tumour microenvironment. These stem cell state transitions play a fundamental role in the process of tumour metastasis, as well as in the resistance to putative therapeutic strategies to target these cells. In this chapter, it will be mainly discussed the emerging knowledge regarding the contribution of BCSCs to tumour heterogeneity, their plasticity, and the role that this plasticity can play in the establishment of distant metastasis. A major focus will also be given to potential clinical implications of these discoveries in breast cancer recurrence and to possible BCSC targeted therapeutics by the use of specific biomarkers.",Adv.

31133044,Inhibition of ERK1/2 in cancer-associated pancreatic stellate cells suppresses cancer-stromal interaction and metastasis.,"BACKGROUND: Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) have been related to multiple cancers, including breast cancer, hepatocellular cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer. ERK1/2 inhibitor can suppress growth of KRAS-mutant pancreatic tumors by targeting cancer cell. However, no studies have shown the expression of ERK1/2 on pancreatic stromal and its effect on pancreatic cancer-stromal interaction.
METHODS: Immunohistochemistry and western blotting were performed to detect the expression of p-ERK1/2 in pancreatic tissues and cells. Cell viability assay was used to study IC50 of ERK inhibitor on pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs) and primary cancer-associated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). Transwell migration, invasion, cell viability assay, senescence β-galactosidase staining were performed to determine the effect of ERK inhibitor on PCCs and PSCs in vitro and in vivo. The expression of key factors involved in autophagy and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process were evaluated by western blotting. The expression of key factors related to cell invasiveness and malignancy were confirmed by qRT-PCR. Co-transplantation of PCC Organoid and PSC using a splenic xenograft mouse model was used to evaluated combined treatment of ERK inhibitor and autophagy inhibitor.
RESULTS: Immunohistochemical staining in pancreatic tumor samples and transgenetic mice detected p-ERK1/2 expression in both cancer cells and stromal cells. In pancreatic tissues, p-ERK1/2 was strongly expressed in cancer-associated PSCs compared with cancer cells and normal PSCs. PSCs were also significantly more sensitive to ERK1/2 inhibitor treatment. Inhibition of ERK1/2 suppressed EMT transition in HMPCCs, upregulated cellular senescence markers, activated autophagy in cancer-associated PSCs; and suppressed cancer-stromal interaction, which enhanced invasiveness and viability of cancer cells. We also found that chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, suppressed ERK inhibition-induced autophagy and promoted PSC cellular senescence, leading to significantly decreased cell proliferation. The combination of an ERK inhibitor and autophagy inhibitor suppressed liver metastasis in a splenic pancreatic cancer organoid xenograft mouse model.

However, expression and function of SNHG7 in breast cancer remain unclear. Herein, we found that SNHG7 was significantly up-regulated in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. SNHG7 knockdown significantly inhibited MCF-7 cell proliferation and invasion, while SNHG7 overexpression dramatically promoted T47D cell proliferation and invasion. Xenograft experiments in vivo showed that SNHG7 knockdown significantly inhibited tumor growth in mice. In terms of mechanism, miR-34a was confirmed to be the target of SNHG7, and SNHG7 could sponge miR-34a to inhibit the expression of miR-34a. In vivo and in vitro experiments both showed that SNHG7 targeted miR-34a and promoted epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) initiation and the Notch-1 pathway in breast cancer. In conclusion, SNHG7 promoted breast cancer tumorigenesis and progression by sponging miR-34a through EMT initiation and the Notch-1 pathway.

31130595,Adult Stem Cell Functioning in the Tumor Micro-Environment.,"Tumor progression from an expanded cell population in a primary location to disseminated lethal growths subverts attempts at cures. It has become evident that these steps are driven in a large part by cancer cell-extrinsic signaling from the tumor microenvironment (TME), one cellular component of which is becoming more appreciated for potential modulation of the cancer cells directly and the TME globally. That cell is a heterogenous population referred to as adult mesenchymal stem cells/multipotent stromal cells (MSCs). Herein, we review emerging evidence as to how these cells, both from distant sources, mainly the bone marrow, or local resident cells, can impact the progression of solid tumors.

31127873,Role of the kringle-like domain in glycoprotein NMB for its tumorigenic potential.,"Glycoprotein NMB (GPNMB) is highly expressed in many types of malignant tumors and thought to be a poor prognostic factor in those cancers, including breast cancer. Glycoprotein NMB is a type IA transmembrane protein that has a long extracellular domain (ECD) and a short intracellular domain (ICD). In general, the ECD of a protein is involved in protein-protein or protein-carbohydrate interactions, whereas the ICD is important for intracellular signaling. We previously reported that GPNMB contributes to the initiation and malignant progression of breast cancer through the hemi-immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (hemITAM) in its ICD. Furthermore, we showed that the tyrosine residue in hemITAM is involved in induction of the stem-like properties of breast cancer cells. However, the contribution of the ECD to its tumorigenic function has yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we focused on the region, the so-called kringle-like domain (KLD), that is conserved among species, and made a deletion mutant, GPNMB(ΔKLD). Enhanced expression of WT GPNMB induced sphere and tumor formation in breast epithelial cells; in contrast, GPNMB(ΔKLD) lacked these activities without affecting its molecular properties, such as subcellular localization, Src-induced tyrosine phosphorylation at least in overexpression experiments, and homo-oligomerization. Additionally, GPNMB(ΔKLD) lost its cell migration promoting activity, even though it reduced E-cadherin expression. Although the interaction partner binding to KLD has not yet been identified, we found that the KLD of GPNMB plays an important role in its tumorigenic potential.",Cancer Sci.,2019,"['Xie R', 'Okita Y', 'Ichikawa Y', 'Fikry MA', 'Huynh Dam KT', 'Tran STP', 'Kato M']",
31127094,Collective cell migration and metastases induced by an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in Drosophila intestinal tumors.,"Metastasis underlies the majority of cancer-related deaths yet remains poorly understood due, in part, to the lack of models in vivo. Here we show that expression of the EMT master inducer Snail in primary adult Drosophila intestinal tumors leads to the dissemination of tumor cells and formation of macrometastases. Snail drives an EMT in tumor cells, which, although retaining some epithelial markers, subsequently break through the basal lamina of the midgut, undergo a collective migration and seed polyclonal metastases. While metastases re-epithelialize over time, we found that early metastases are remarkably mesenchymal, discarding the requirement for a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition for early stages of metastatic growth. Our results demonstrate the formation of metastases in adult flies, and identify a key role for partial-EMTs in driving it. This model opens the door to investigate the basic mechanisms underlying metastasis, in a powerful in vivo system suited for rapid genetic and drug screens.",Nat Commun,2019,"['Campbell K', 'Rossi F', 'Adams J', 'Pitsidianaki I', 'Barriga FM', 'Garcia-Gerique L', 'Batlle E', 'Casanova J', 'Casali A']",
31125562,Jarid2 enhances the progression of bladder cancer through regulating PTEN/AKT signaling.,"AIMS: Jumonji AT-rich interactive domain 2 (Jarid2) is an interacting component of PRC2 which catalyzes methylation of H3K27 (H3K27me3) and causes the downregulation of PTEN. In the present study, we aimed to explore whether Jarid2 could interact with H3K27me3 to regulate PTEN expression in bladder cancer.
MAIN METHODS: Jarid2 expression in bladder cancer tissues and cells were determined by western blotting and RT-PCR. CCK-8, flow cytometry, transwell chamber and in vivo xenograft assays were performed to assess cell growth, apoptosis, migration and tumorigenesis, respectively. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was used to assess the methylation of PTEN.
KEY FINDINGS: Jarid2 expression was increased in bladder cancer tissues and cells. Downregulation of Jarid2 with shRNA transfection obviously inhibited the proliferation, migration and tumorigenesis of bladder cancer T24 and HT-1376 cells and induced cell apoptosis. Jarid2 downregulation decreased the expression of p-AKT and increased PTEN expression. Besides, Jarid2 down-regulation repressed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), whereas knockdown of PTEN impaired this effect. Moreover, upregulation of Jarid2 increased the combination of PTEN promoter and H3K27me3, and 5-aza-CdR rescued it. Meanwhile, 5-aza-CdR administration abolished Jarid2 roles in the promotion of EMT process and AKT activation, as well as the reduction of PTEN expression.
SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, the present study elaborated that Jarid2 facilitated the progression of bladder cancer through H3K27me3-mediated PTEN downregulation and AKT activation, which might provide a new mechanism for Jarid2 in promoting bladder cancer progression.",Life Sci.,2019,"['Wang X', 'Lyu J', 'Ji A', 'Zhang Q', 'Liao G']",
31121000,Clonorchis sinensis excretory-secretory products increase malignant characteristics of cholangiocarcinoma cells in three-dimensional co-culture with biliary ductal plates.,"Clonorchis sinensis is a carcinogenic human liver fluke, prolonged infection which provokes chronic inflammation, epithelial hyperplasia, periductal fibrosis, and even cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). These effects are driven by direct physical damage caused by the worms, as well as chemical irritation from their excretory-secretory products (ESPs) in the bile duct and surrounding liver tissues. We investigated the C. sinensis ESP-mediated malignant features of CCA cells (HuCCT1) in a three-dimensional microfluidic culture model that mimics an in vitro tumor microenvironment. This system consisted of a type I collagen extracellular matrix, applied ESPs, GFP-labeled HuCCT1 cells and quiescent biliary ductal plates formed by normal cholangiocytes (H69 cells). HuCCT1 cells were attracted by a gradient of ESPs in a concentration-dependent manner and migrated in the direction of the ESPs. Meanwhile, single cell invasion by HuCCT1 cells increased independently of the direction of the ESP gradient. ESP treatment resulted in elevated secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) by H69 cells and a cadherin switch (decrease in E-cadherin/increase in N-cadherin expression) in HuCCT1 cells, indicating an increase in epithelial-mesenchymal transition-like changes by HuCCT1 cells. Our findings suggest that C. sinensis ESPs promote the progression of CCA in a tumor microenvironment via the interaction between normal cholangiocytes and CCA cells. These observations broaden our understanding of the progression of CCA caused by liver fluke infection and suggest a new approach for the development of chemotherapeutic for this infectious cancer.",PLoS Pathog.,2019,"['Won J', 'Cho Y', 'Lee D', 'Jeon BY', 'Ju JW', 'Chung S', 'Pak JH']",
31119584,Dihydrotestosterone increases the risk of bladder cancer in men.,"Men are at a higher risk of developing bladder cancer than women. Although the urinary bladder is not regarded as an sex organ, it has the potential to respond to androgen signals. The mechanisms responsible for the gender differences remain unexplained. Androgen receptor (AR) after binding with 5α-dihydrotestosteron (DHT) undergoes a conformational change and translocates to nucleus to induce transcriptional regulation of target genes. However androgen/AR signaling can also be activated by interacting with several signaling molecules and exert its non-genomic function. The aim of present study was to explain whether the progression of bladder cancer in men is dependent on androgen/AR signaling. Studies were carried out on human bladder cancer cell lines: HCV29, T24, HT1376 and HTB9. Bladder cancer cells were treated for 48 h with 10 nM DHT or not, with replacement after 24 h. Expression of cell signaling proteins, was analyzed using Western Blot and RT-PCR. Subcellular localization of protein was studied using the ProteoExtract Subcellular Proteome Extraction Kit and Western blot analysis. We showed that DHT treatment significantly increased AR expression in bladder cell line HCV29. We also observed DHT-mediated activation of Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathway which plays a central role in cancer progression. Presented results also show that androgen/AR signaling is implicated in phosphorylation of eIF4E which can promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We indicate that AR plays an essential role in bladder cancer progression in male patients. Therefore, androgen-activated AR signaling is an attractive regulatory target for the inhibition or prevention of bladder cancer incidence in men.",Hum.

Distant metastasis is a key cause of CRC‑associated mortality. MEIS2 has been identified to be dysregulated in several types of human cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying the regulatory role of MEIS2 in CRC metastasis remain largely unknown. For the first time, the present study demonstrated that MEIS2 serves a role as a promoter of metastasis in CRC. In vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that knockdown of MEIS2 significantly suppressed CRC migration, invasion and the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, microarray and bioinformatics analyses were performed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of MEIS2 in the regulation of CRC metastasis.

The present study explored the effects of leptin on the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) and pro‑angiogenic capability of cholangiocarcinoma cells, and investigated the underlying mechanisms. Cholangiocarcinoma cells were treated with leptin, and their migration and invasion rates were investigated using Transwell assays. Furthermore, conditioned medium was collected from cholangiocarcinoma cells following leptin treatment and applied to human umbilical vein endothelial cells to assess tube formation. The expression of EMT and pro‑angiogenic factors was examined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) and western blot analyses. Mechanistically, the function of pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme M2 (PKM2) was assessed in leptin‑induced phenotypes using siRNA targeting PKM2 (si‑PKM2). Bioinformatics screening and luciferase reporter assays were used to reveal microRNA (miR)‑122 as the potential mediator between leptin and PKM2. Finally, the associations between leptin and miR‑122 or PKM2 levels in patients with cholangiocarcinoma were assessed by ELISA and RT‑qPCR. Leptin significantly increased the EMT and pro‑angiogenic capability of cholangiocarcinoma cells, visibly inhibited endogenous miR‑122 expression, and upregulated PKM2. Furthermore, si‑PKM2 inhibited leptin‑induced migration, invasion, EMT‑associated marker expression levels and the pro‑angiogenic capability in cholangiocarcinoma cells. In addition, miR‑122 negatively regulated the expression of PKM2. When applied together with leptin, miR‑122 was sufficient to reverse the multiple malignancy‑promoting effects of leptin. Consistently, the serum leptin level positively correlated with that of PKM2, but negatively with that of miR‑122 in patients with cholangiocarcinoma. Leptin, by downregulating miR‑122 and elevating PKM2 expression, acts as a pleiotropic pro‑malignancy cytokine for cholangiocarcinoma. Therefore, increasing miR‑122 expression and inhibiting PKM2 may be future approaches for cholangiocarcinoma treatment.",Int. J.

The present study aimed to investigate the roles and clinical relevance of MTMR2 as well as the underlying mechanisms in gastric cancer (GC).
METHODS: MTMR2 expression was examined in 295 GC samples by using immunohistochemistry (IHC). The correlation between MTMR2 expression and clinicopathological features and outcomes of the patients was analyzed. The roles of MTMR2 in regulating the invasive and metastatic capabilities of GC cells were observed using gain-and loss-of-function assays both in vitro and in vivo. The pathways involved in MTMR2-regulating invasion and metastasis were selected and identified by using mRNA expression profiling.

31109257,Role of RUNX2 transcription factor in epithelial mesenchymal transition in non-small cell lung cancer lung cancer: Epigenetic control of the RUNX2 P1 promoter.,"Lung cancer has a high mortality rate in men and women worldwide. Approximately 15% of diagnosed patients with this type of cancer do not exceed the 5-year survival rate. Unfortunately, diagnosis is established in advanced stages, where other tissues or organs can be affected. In recent years, lineage-specific transcription factors have been associated with a variety of cancers. One such transcription factor possibly regulating cancer is RUNX2, the master gene of early and late osteogenesis. In thyroid and prostate cancer, it has been reported that RUNX2 regulates expression of genes important in tumor cell migration and invasion. In this study, we report on RUNX2/ p57 overexpression in 16 patients with primary non-small cell lung cancer and/or metastatic lung cancer associated with H3K27Ac at P1 gene promoter region. In some patients, H3K4Me3 enrichment was also detected, in addition to WDR5, MLL2, MLL4, and UTX enzyme recruitment, members of the COMPASS-LIKE complex. Moreover, transforming growth factor-β induced RUNX2/ p57 overexpression and specific RUNX2 knockdown supported a role for RUNX2 in epithelial mesenchymal transition, which was demonstrated through loss of function assays in adenocarcinoma A549 lung cancer cell line.

31109060,Cross-Talk between Inflammatory Mediators and the Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition Process in the Development of Thyroid Carcinoma.,"There is strong association between inflammatory processes and their main metabolic mediators, such as leptin, adiponectin secretion, and low/high-density lipoproteins, with the cancer risk and aggressive behavior of solid tumors. In this scenario, cancer cells (CCs) and cancer stem cells (CSCs) have important roles. These cellular populations, which come from differentiated cells and progenitor stem cells, have increased metabolic requirements when it comes to maintaining or expanding the tumors, and they serve as links to some inflammatory mediators. Although the molecular mechanisms that are involved in these associations remain unclear, the two following cellular pathways have been suggested: 1) the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) process, which permits the differentiation of adult stem cells throughout the acquisition of cell polarity and the adhesion to epithelia, as well to new cellular lineages (CSCs); and, 2) a reverse process, termed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), where, in pathophysiological conditions (tissue injury, inflammatory process, and oxidative stress), the differentiated cells can acquire a multipotent stem cell-like phenotype.

31108117,Epithelial mesenchymal transition and resistance in endocrine-related cancers.,"Epithelial to mesencyhmal transition (EMT) has a central role in tumor metastasis and progression. EMT is regulated by several growth factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The most important role in this regulation could be attributed to transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). In breast cancer, TGF-β effect on EMT could be potentiated by Fos-related antigen, oncogene HER2, epidermal growth factor, or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 5 - extracellular-regulated kinase signaling. Several microRNAs in breast cancer have a considerable role either in potentiation or in suppression of EMT thus acting as oncogenic or tumor suppressive modulators. At present, possibilities to target EMT are discussed but the results of clinical translation are still limited. In prostate cancer, many cellular events are regulated by androgenic hormones. Different experimental results on androgenic stimulation or inhibition of EMT have been reported in the literature. Thus, a possibility that androgen ablation therapy leads to EMT thus facilitating tumor progression has to be discussed. Novel therapy agents, such as the anti-diabetic drug metformin or selective estrogen receptor modulator ormeloxifene were used in pre-clinical studies to inhibit EMT in prostate cancer. Taken together, the results of pre-clinical and clinical studies in breast cancer may be helpful in the process of drug development and identify potential risk during the early stage of that process.",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Res,2019,['Culig Z'],
31106370,Snail1-dependent cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition in lung cancer cells via exosomes.,"BACKGROUND: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an essential component of metastasis. Our previous study demonstrated that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) induce EMT in lung cancer cells. In recent years, many studies have demonstrated that CAFs induce metastasis and drug resistance in cancer cells via exosomes.
AIM: We sought to discover the mechanism underlying how CAFs induce EMT in lung cancer cells, unveiling the role of exosomes in lung cancer progression.
DESIGN: We cultured lung cancer cell (i) with control medium, normal fibroblasts (NFs) or CAFs; (ii) with SNAI1-transfected or NC (negative control)-transfected CAFs; (iii) with exosomes extracted from NF- or CAF-conditioned medium; (iv) with exosomes released by SNAI1 or NC-transfected CAFs; (v) with CAF-conditioned medium or exosome-depleted CAF-conditioned medium.
METHODS: qRT-PCR was conducted to examine the expression of CDH1 (gene of E-cadherin) and VIM (gene of Vimentin), western blotting was conducted to examine E-cadherin and vimentin levels in lung cancer cells.
RESULTS: Exosomes released by CAFs-promoted EMT in lung cancer cells. Interestingly, SNAI1 levels in exosomes secreted from CAFs were correlated with SNAI1 expression in CAFs. Furthermore, the level of SNAI1 in exosomes was crucial for inducing EMT in lung cancer cells. Finally, treatment of CAFs with GW4869, an inhibitor of exosome release, noticeably inhibited their EMT-inducing effect on recipient epithelial cells.
CONCLUSIONS: The molecular mechanism underlying how CAFs induce EMT in cancer cells may be that CAFs deliver SNAI1 to recipient cancer cells via exosomes.",QJM,2019,"['You J', 'Li M', 'Cao LM', 'Gu QH', 'Deng PB', 'Tan Y', 'Hu CP']",
31105009,Quantitative Super-Resolution Microscopy of the Mammalian Glycocalyx.,"The mammalian glycocalyx is a heavily glycosylated extramembrane compartment found on nearly every cell. Despite its relevance in both health and disease, studies of the glycocalyx remain hampered by a paucity of methods to spatially classify its components. We combine metabolic labeling, bioorthogonal chemistry, and super-resolution localization microscopy to image two constituents of cell-surface glycans, N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and sialic acid, with 10-20 nm precision in 2D and 3D. This approach enables two measurements: glycocalyx height and the distribution of individual sugars distal from the membrane. These measurements show that the glycocalyx exhibits nanoscale organization on both cell lines and primary human tumor cells. Additionally, we observe enhanced glycocalyx height in response to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and to oncogenic KRAS activation. In the latter case, we trace increased height to an effector gene, GALNT7. These data highlight the power of advanced imaging methods to provide molecular and functional insights into glycocalyx biology.",Dev.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: ELF3 showed selective expression in low-grade cell lines and tumor tissues. Overexpression of ELF3 in mesenchymal cell line UMUC3 resulted in reduced invasion and decreased expression of mesenchymal markers.

In this study, we aimed to explore the expressing pattern, clinical significance and potential function of a newly identified circRNA, hsa_circ_001569, in BC. RT-PCR was performed to detect the expression of hsa_circ_001569 in both BC tissues and cell lines. The associations between hsa_circ_001569 expression and clinicopathological features and prognosis in BC patients were statistically analyzed. Next, we investigated the effects of hsa_circ_001569 on the proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion in BC cells lines. The effects of abnormal hsa_circ_001569 expression on EMT pathway and PI3K/AKT pathway were determined using Western blot. We found that hsa_circ_001569 expression was significantly up-regulated in both BC tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of hsa_circ_001569 was associated with Lymph node metastasis, advanced clinical stage and shorter overall survival. Multivariate assay confirmed that hsa_circ_001569 expression was an independent prognostic factor for 5-year overall survival. Furthermore, functional investigations revealed that knockdown of hsa_circ_001569 significantly suppressed the growth and metastatic potentials of BC cells. Besides, molecular mechanistic study revealed that depression of hsa_circ_001569 impeded the activation of PI3K-AKT signaling in BC cells. Our results indicated that hsa_circ_001569 upregulation was associated with BC lymph-node metastasis, clinical stage, and poor prognosis.

METHODS: The expression of lncRNA PANDAR in 65 pairs of breast cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues was detected by quantitative Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay. The association between lncRNA PANDAR expression and clinical factors of breast cancer was analyzed. Cell proliferation, cell colony formation and cell invasion assays were performed to detect the effects of lncRNA PANDAR expression tumor proliferation and invasion abilities.

RESULTS: We demonstrated that lncRNA PANDAR expression was higher in breast cancer tissues and cells compared with adjacent normal tissues and the normal mammary epithelial cell line, respectively. Higher lncRNA PANDAR expression positively associated with lymph node metastasis and advanced clinical stage in patients. In vitro, we demonstrated that knockdown of lncRNA PANDAR significantly suppressed cell proliferation, cell colony formation and cell invasion ability in breast cells. Furthermore, we verified that knockdown of lncRNA PANDAR dramatically inhibited cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway by downregulating Vimentin, MMP2 and MMP9 expression, but upregulating E-cadherin expression in breast cancer.

31102316,Hyaluronic acid synthase 2 promotes malignant phenotypes of colorectal cancer cells through transforming growth factor beta signaling.,"Hyaluronic acid synthase 2 (HAS2) is suggested to play a critical role in malignancy and is abnormally expressed in many carcinomas. However, its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) malignancy and specific signaling mechanisms remain obscure. Here, we report that HAS2 was markedly increased in both CRC tissue and malignant CRC cell lines. Depletion of HAS2 in HCT116 and DLD1 cells, which express high levels of HAS2, critically increased sensitivity of radiation/oxaliplatin-mediated apoptotic cell death. Moreover, downregulation of HAS2 suppressed migration, invasion and metastasis in nude mice. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of HAS2 in SW480 cells, which express low levels of HAS2, showed the opposite effect. Notably, HAS2 loss- and gain-of-function experiments revealed that it regulates CRC malignancy through TGF-β expression and SMAD2/Snail downstream components. Collectively, our findings suggest that HAS2 contributes to malignant phenotypes of CRC, at least partly, through activation of the TGF-β signaling pathway, and shed light on the novel mechanisms behind the constitutive activation of HAS2 signaling in CRC, thereby highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.",Cancer Sci.,2019,"['Kim YH', 'Lee SB', 'Shim S', 'Kim A', 'Park JH', 'Jang WS', 'Lee SJ', 'Myung JK', 'Park S', 'Lee SJ', 'Kim MJ']",

Polarized epithelial cells interact with the basement membrane (BM) and, in particular, with laminins, the major components of BM. Here, we examined the effect of the transition of colon cancer cells from 2D polarized state to non-polarized 3D state on the expression of EMT associated genes, as well as the role of laminins 332 and 411 (LM-332 and LM-411) in this process. The three studied cell lines, HT-29, HCT-116 and RKO, were found to have different sensitivity to cultivation conditions (2D to 3D changes) and to addition of laminins. One of the possible reasons for this maybe a difference in the initial 2D state of the cells. In particular, it was shown that the cell lines were at different EMT stages. HT-29 exhibited more epithelial expression profile, RKO was more mesenchymal, and HCT-116 was in an intermediate state. The most laminin-sensitive cell line was HCT-116. The magnitude and the specificity of cell response to LM-332 and LM-411 depended on the expression pattern of laminins' receptors. EMT gene expression profile was not substantially changed neither during the transition from 2D to 3D state, nor the presence of laminins' isoforms. However, we detected changes in expression of SNAI1 and ZEB1 genes encoding transcription factors that control the EMT process. Notably, in all three studied cell lines, the expression of SNAI1 was enhanced in response to laminin treatment.",Mol. Biol.

Whether R-spondins-LGR signaling affects the progression of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) remain unknown. This study aims to uncover the role of R-spodin2/LGR4 in tongue SCC (TSCC).
METHODS: The expression of Rspo2 in TSCC specimens and its correlation with TSCC clinical outcome were evaluated. Levels of Rspo2 or LGR4 were altered by pharmacological and genetic approaches, and the effects on TSCC progression were assessed.
FINDINGS: Aberrantly high levels of Rspo2 were detected in TSCC specimens. Its levels were closely related with lymph node metastasis, clinical stage and survival rate in patients with tongue SCC. Exogenous Rspo2 or overexpression of Rspo2 promoted growth, migration and invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stem-like properties in SCC both in vivo and in vitro. Silence of Rspo2 abolished these phenotypes. LGR4 was functionally upregulated by Rspo2 in TSCC. Overexpression of Rspo2 increased, whereas Rspo2 silencing decreased the expression of LGR4, leading to subsequent phosphorylation of LRP6 and nuclear translocation of β-catenin in TSCC cell lines. This nuclear translocation of β-catenin was associated with a significant alteration in TCF-1, a downstream nuclear transcription factor of β-catenin, as well as its target genes: CD44, CyclinD1 and c-Myc.

31096701,The Vicious Cross-Talk between Tumor Cells with an EMT Phenotype and Cells of the Immune System.,"Carcinoma cells that undergo an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and display a predominantly mesenchymal phenotype (hereafter EMT tumor cells) are associated with immune exclusion and immune deviation in the tumor microenvironment (TME). A large body of evidence has shown that EMT tumor cells and immune cells can reciprocally influence each other, with EMT cells promoting immune exclusion and deviation and immune cells promoting, under certain circumstances, the induction of EMT in tumor cells. This cross-talk between EMT tumor cells and immune cells can occur both between EMT tumor cells and cells of either the native or adaptive immune system. In this article, we review this evidence and the functional consequences of it. We also discuss some recent evidence showing that tumor cells and cells of the immune system respond to similar stimuli, activate the expression of partially overlapping gene sets, and acquire, at least in part, identical functionalities such as migration and invasion. The possible significance of these symmetrical changes in the cross-talk between EMT tumor cells and immune cells is addressed.

This work investigated the senescence characteristics of cancer cells in vitro. MATERIAL AND METHODS Human cervical cancer HeLa cells were treated with different concentrations of doxorubicin for 3 days, with or without subsequent extended culture in drug-free medium for 6 days. Senescent cell ratios between these 2 culture schemes were calculated. Expression of 2 senescence-associated secretory factors, IL-6 and IL-8, were detected by RT-PCR and ELISA. Doxorubicin treatment induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer cells. The proportions of senescent cells in epithelial-like and mesenchymal-like sub-groups were calculated. Doxorubicin-treated HeLa cells were stained with Vimentin antibody and sorted by flow cytometry. Senescent cell marker p16ᴵᴺᴷ⁴ᵃ and IL-8 expression in Vimentin-high and Vimentin-low cells were detected by Western blot. RESULTS We found that less than 1% of HeLa cells showed senescence phenotype after treatment with doxorubicin for 3 days. However, the proportion of senescent cells was significantly increased when the doxorubicin-treated cells were subsequently cultured in drug-free medium for another 6d. RT-PCR and ELISA results showed that this prolonged culture method could further improve the expression of IL-6 and IL-8. We also found that the senescent cells were mainly epithelial-like type and few presented mesenchymal-like shape. p16ᴵᴺᴷ⁴ᵃ and IL-8 expression were decreased in cell fraction with higher Vimentin expression.

Although EMT is a complex process, recently, it has been reported that CD146 overexpression in prostate cancer cells is sufficient to induce mesenchymal phenotype. The following study aimed to investigate whether the expression of CD146 is altered by an epigenetic modifier in prostate cancer cells, in vitro.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three human prostate cancer cell lines were treated with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine; the expression of CD146 and EMT-related factors was analyzed by RT-PCR and western Blot. The methylation status of the CD146 promoter area was assessed using bisulfite sequencing.
RESULTS: Our data showed that, the expression of CD146 was evidently increased in all three studied cell lines in response to a demethylating agent, both at the mRNA and protein level, suggesting epigenetic regulation of the analyzed gene. However, there was no methylation in the studied CpG island in CD146 gene promoter. Moreover, the demethylating agent induced the expression of EMT-related transcription factors (SNAI1, SNAI2, TWIST1 and ZEB1), the pattern of which differed among the cell lines, as well as alterations in cell morphology; altogether accounting for the mesenchymal phenotype.
CONCLUSION: The demethylating agent 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine triggers the expression of CD146 in prostate cancer cells independently on the methylation status of the analyzed CpG island fragment in CD146 gene promoter. Moreover, demethylation treatment induces a mesenchymal profile in prostate cancer cells.",Anticancer Res.,2019,"['Dudzik P', 'Trojan SE', 'Ostrowska B', 'Zemanek G', 'Dulińska-Litewka J', 'Laidler P', 'Kocemba-Pilarczyk KA']",

However, opioid analgesics, like morphine and fentanyl, which are widely used in cancer pain treatment have been reported to enhance stem-like traits and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of breast cancer cells. As such, it is vital to make the best choice of analgesic for breast cancer management.
METHODS: MTT assays and colony formation assays were performed to examine tumor cell proliferation upon nalbuphine treatment.

RESULTS: Nalbuphine inhibited breast cancer cell growth and tumorigenesis, with little effect on noncancerous breast cell lines. Nalbuphine suppressed cancer stem-like traits and EMT in both breast cancer cells and mouse xenograft tumor tissues. Additionally, activation of AKT reversed the nalbuphine-induced inhibition of cancer stem-like properties, tumorigenesis and EMT.

Here, we elucidated the function and possible molecular mechanisms of the effect of lncRNA-AGAP2-AS1 on the biological behaviors of HCC.
METHODS: EdU, Transwell and flow cytometry were used to determine proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis of HCC cells in vitro. The subcutaneous tumor model and lung metastasis mouse model in nude mice was established to detect tumor growth and metastasis of HCC in vivo. The direct binding of miR-16-5p to 3'UTR of ANXA11 was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. The expression of AGAP2-AS1 and miR-16-5p in HCC specimens and cell lines were detected by real-time PCR. The correlation among AGAP2-AS1 and miR-16-5p were disclosed by a dual-luciferase reporter assay, RIP assay and biotin pull-down assay.
RESULTS: Here, we demonstrated that AGAP2-AS1 expression was up-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines, especially in metastatic and recurrent cases. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments indicated that AGAP2-AS1 promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT progression and inhibited apoptosis of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Further studies demonstrated that AGAP2-AS1 could function as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by sponging miR-16-5p in HCC cells. Functionally, gain- and loss-of-function studies showed that miR-16-5p promoted HCC progression and alteration of miR-16-5p abolished the promotive effects of AGAP2-AS1 on HCC cells. Moreover, ANXA11 was identified as direct downstream targets of miR-16-5p in HCC cells, and mediated the functional effects of miR-16-5p and AGAP2-AS1 in HCC, resulting in AKT signaling activation. Clinically, AGAP2-AS1 and miR-16-5p expression were markedly correlated with adverse clinical features and poor prognosis of HCC patients. We showed that hypoxia was responsible for the overexpression of AGAP2-AS1 in HCC. And the promoting effects of hypoxia on metastasis and EMT of HCC cells were reversed by AGAP2-AS1 knockdown.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, this research supports the first evidence that AGAP2-AS1 plays an oncogenic role in HCC via AGAP2-AS1/miR-16-5p/ANXA11/AKT axis pathway and represents a promising therapeutic strategy for HCC patients.",J.

We aimed to verify the hypothesis that exposure of tumor cells to the brain microenvironment leads to changes in their gene expression, which promotes their oriented transfer to the brain. A549 and H1299 lung adenocarcinoma cells were exposed to human astrocyte-conditioned medium to simulate the brain microenvironment. Microarray analysis was used to identify differentially expressed genes, which were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting. Knockdown experiments using microRNAs and the overexpression of genes by cell transfection were performed in addition to migration and invasion assays. In vitro findings were confirmed in clinical specimens using immunohistochemistry. We found and confirmed a significant increase in insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP3) levels. Our results also showed that the up-regulation of IGFBP3 promoted A549 cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration, and invasion, while the knockdown of IGFBP3 resulted in decreased cell motility. We also found that Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4 (Smad4)-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition was likely IGFBP3-dependent in A549 cells.

Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression analysis were performed to evaluate the prognostic significance of ABCB9. GSEA was performed to explore related signaling pathway.ABCB9 expression levels were significantly decreased in OC compared with normal ovarian tissues (P < .001). Low ABCB9 expression was associated with survival status (P = .0148) in OC. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that low ABCB9 expression was associated with poor overall survival in OC (P = .0032). Multivariable Cox regression analysis indicated that low ABCB9 expression was an independent prognostic factor (HR 0.64; P = .01) in OC patients. Besides, epithelial mesenchymal transition, UV response, and TGF-β signaling were enriched in low ABCB9 expression phenotype, respectively, examined by gene set enrichment analysis.These results suggest that ABCB9 is an independent prognostic indicator in OC with certain clinical significance.",Medicine (Baltimore),2019,"['Hou L', 'Zhang X', 'Jiao Y', 'Li Y', 'Zhao Y', 'Guan Y', 'Liu Z']",
31081930,7-Deoxynarciclasine shows promising antitumor efficacy by targeting Akt against hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Akt is a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment. In our study, we have identified that 7-deoxynarciclasine (7-DONCS) is a potential inhibitor of Akt, which results in the repression of multiple oncogenic processes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We have found that 7-DONCS suppresses the growth of HCC by inducing the apoptotic and autophagic capacities, as well as by inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and in vivo. Pretreatment of cells with specific autophagy inhibitor (Bafilomycin A1) or knockdown of endogenous LC-3B by siRNA strongly abrogates 7-DONCS-regulated apoptosis and EMT. Consequently, we have found that 7-DONCS selectively inhibits phospho-Akt (Ser473), and subsequent molecular docking reveals that 7-DONCS directly binds to the C-terminal domain of Akt. Overexpressing Akt significantly blocks these effects via 7-DONCS in HCC cells. Furthermore, 7-DONCS, by targeting Akt, exhibits a promising therapeutic effect in orthotopic hepatocellular tumors. Finally, higher p-Akt expression is associated with poor prognosis, and higher level of Akt was positively correlated with the enrichment of both apoptosis and autophagy downregulation, and EMT upregulation in HCC patients. These studies suggest that 7-DONCS serves as an attractive drug candidate by targeting Akt for future HCC therapy.",Int. J.

31081057,"Evaluation of pro‑ and anti‑tumor effects induced by three colony‑stimulating factors, G‑CSF, GM‑CSF and M‑CSF, in bladder cancer cells: Is G‑CSF a friend of bladder cancer cells?","Cytotoxic chemotherapy is the standard treatment for patients with advanced bladder cancer. However, this treatment can cause transient and prolonged neutropenia, which can result in fatal infection. Three recombinant human colony‑stimulating factors (CSFs), granulocyte CSF (G‑CSF), granulocyte‑macrophage CSF (GM‑CSF), and macrophage CSF (M‑CSF), are currently available to reduce the duration and degree of neutropenia. The present study investigated the pro‑ and anti‑tumor effects of these three CSFs and the changes in molecular profiles. Xenograft tumors in athymic mice were generated by subcutaneously inoculating the human bladder cancer cell lines MGH‑U3 and UM‑UC‑3. A total of 2 weeks after cell inoculation, mice were randomly divided into four groups (control, G‑CSF, GM‑CSF and M‑CSF) and treated thrice a week for 2 weeks. Tumor growth during monitoring and tumor weight at the time of euthanization were significantly higher in mice treated with G‑CSF and lower in mice treated with GM‑CSF compared with the control mice. Tumors were examined by immunostaining with antibodies against proteins associated tumor proliferation (Ki‑67), angiogenesis [CD31 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)], anti‑immunity (CD204) and epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT; E‑cadherin). Immunohistochemical staining revealed that tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, recruitment of M2 macrophages and EMT were promoted by G‑CSF, whereas lymphangiogenesis and recruitment of M2 macrophages were inhibited by GM‑CSF. Treatment‑associated changes in serum pro‑ and anti‑tumoral cytokines and chemokines were evaluated by enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)‑based arrays. In the ELISA for serum, the levels of cytokines associated with angiogenesis (interleukin‑6 and VEGF), and EMT (transforming growth factor‑β1 and ‑β2) were elevated in mice treated with G‑CSF. Treatment with GM‑CSF and M‑CSF also affected the level of these cytokines characteristically. The current results indicate that administration of exogenous G‑CSF to patients with bladder cancer promotes tumor growth through promotion of cell proliferation, angiogenesis, recruitment of M2 macrophages and enhancement of EMT through the modulation of the tumor microenvironment.",Int.

31081043,TGF-β-induced long non-coding RNA MIR155HG promotes the progression and EMT of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma by regulating the miR-155-5p/SOX10 axis.,"Non‑coding RNAs, particularly long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs), play important roles in tumorigenesis. The miR‑155 host gene (MIR155HG) lncRNA has been found to play a crucial role in tumor progression. However, the role of MIR155HG in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) remains unclear. Thus, the aim of the present study was to explore the roles and underlying molecular mechanisms of action of MIR155HG and miR‑155‑5p in LSCC, in an effort to provide novel approaches for the antitumor therapy for LSCC. In the present study, the expression levels of miR‑155‑5p and MIR155HG were detected by reverse tran-scription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In addition, the biological functions of MIR155HG and miR‑155‑5p on LSCC were evaluated in vitro by MTS assay, colony formation assay and Transwell assays, and in vivo by tumorigenesis assays. It was revealed that MIR155HG and miR‑155‑5p were significantly upregulated in LSCC tissues, and were associated with the TNM stage, pathological differentiation and lymph node metastasis. Moreover, the knockdown of MIR155HG and miR‑155‑5p inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of LSCC cells, whereas their overexpression exerted the opposite effects in vitro and MIR155HG overexpression promoted tumorigenesis in vivo. Furthermore, MIR155HG downregulation reduced the expression level of miR‑155‑5p. The inhibitory effect of MIR155HG knockdown on malignant behavior was abrogated by miR‑155‑5p overexpression. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR‑155‑5p contributed to the progression of LSCC by directly binding to the 3' untranslated region of SRY‑related‑HMG‑box 10 (SOX10). In addition, MIR155HG and miR‑155‑5p were upregulated by the induction of transforming growth factor‑β (TGF‑β) and promoted the expression of mesenchymal markers synergistically. On the whole, the findings of the present study indicate a novel role of MIR155HG in the TGF‑β‑induced EMT of LSCC cells by regulating EMT markers through the miR‑155/SOX10 axis. The MIR155HG/miR‑155‑5p/SOX10 axis plays an important role in promoting the progression of LSCC and may thus serve as a potential therapeutic target for LSCC treatment.",Int. J.

Additionally, we examined prognostic significance of IFITM1 according to pTNM stage to confirm that IFITM1 can serve as a complement to the pTNM stage. A total of 141 lung adenocarcinoma specimens were evaluated retrospectively by immunohistochemical staining for IFITM1, EMT markers (e-cadherin, β-catenin, and vimentin), and CD31 to measure microvessel density. IFITM1was expressed in 46.8% of the specimens. IFITM1 expression was significantly correlated with increased microvessel density (P = 0.048). However, IFITM1 expression was not associated with three EMT markers. In a multivariate analysis, IFITM1 was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in a multivariate analysis (hazard ratio: 2.59, P = 0.01). Online database with data from 720 lung adenocarcinoma patients also revealed a negative prognostic significance of IFITM1 (P < 0.001). Furthermore, high IFITM1 expression was significantly correlated with decreased OS rates in each pTNM stage.

31077446,CCL2 promotes cell migration by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition in oral squamous cell carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: Although a few studies suggested that the chemokine CCL2 might be involved in the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), the exact mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine the resource of CCL2 in lesions and explored a potential mechanism that CCL2 promotes tumor progression. The study was an effort to provide new insights into the pathological role of CCL2 in OSCC.
METHODS: Specimens of OSCC and normal oral mucosa were stained using immunohistochemistry (IHC) to assess the CCL2 expression. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the difference of CCL2 between OSCC and normal oral mucosa cell lines. In addition, we treated OSCC cells with exogenous rCCL2 combined with or without CCL2 neutralizing antibody and then determined the changes of in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and cell migration capacity using immunofluorescence, Western blotting, transwell migration, and wound healing assays.
RESULTS: We have found that CCL2 expression was upregulated significantly in both lesions and cell culture supernatant of OSCC compared with controls. IHC staining demonstrated that CCL2 expression was primarily located in the cytoplasm and cell membrane of cells. We have also found that rCCL2 could effectively induce EMT through upregulating Snail in OSCC cells, which was demonstrated by the decrease of E-cadherin and the increase of vimentin. In addition, we have found that CCL2 neutralizing antibody could block EMT induced by CCL2 in OSCC.

31077234,Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α induces CX3CR1 expression and promotes the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in ovarian cancer cells.,"BACKGROUND: Chemokines are involved in the homing of various cancer cells, including those of ovarian cancer (OvCa), to distant organs. They may also promote or inhibit cancer progression and metastasis. Hypoxia, a common phenomenon in malignant tumors, promotes cell proliferation regulated by HIF-1α. Hypoxia-induced genes are involved in metastasis-associated functions and in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
RESULTS: Tissue microarrays of human OvCa showed elevated expression of CX3CR1 and HIF-1α compared to normal cells, and their levels were higher in adenocarcinoma stages II and III. To substantiate these observations, we performed studies using OvCa cells. Following exposure to hypoxia, OVCAR-3, SW 626, and TOV-112D cells showed high expression of CX3CR1, a transmembrane protein involved in the adhesion and migration of leukocytes, causing an increased chemotactic response to CX3CL1, the ligand for CX3CR1. As determined by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, RT-PCR, and western blots, there were higher expressions of CX3CR1 and HIF-1α in OvCa cell lines exposed to hypoxia. Further, OvCa cells expressing CX3CR1 were sensitive to the CX3CL1 ligand. Chemotaxis based on chemokine receptors was influential in elevating the expression of EMT markers and matrix metalloproteinases, which are involved in the progression and metastasis of cancer cells.
CONCLUSIONS: In OvCa cells, CX3CR1 was upregulated in a process involving hypoxia-mediated regulation of HIF-1α. The elevated levels of CX3CR1, which were sensitive to CX3CL1, increased EMT markers that led to the progression and metastasis of OvCa. Thus, CX3CR1 and HIF-1α are suitable targets for treatment of OvCa.",J Ovarian Res,2019,"['Singh SK', 'Mishra MK', 'Singh R']",
31075731,Therapeutic approach of Cancer stem cells (CSCs) in gastric adenocarcinoma, DNA methyltransferases enzymes in cancer targeted therapy.,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) show a remarkable sub class of cancer cells population which have a potential to organize and regulate stemness properties which possess a main particular responsibility for uncontrolled growth in carcinogenesis, production of different cancers in differentiated situation and also resistancy to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Correspondingly, gastric cancer (GC) as a very serious type in cancer mortality in the world, has received a deep attention in molecular therapy recently. Besides the main characteristics of CSCs like differentiation, epithelial mesenchymal transition, self-renewal and metastasis, they are so effective in expression of stemness genes resistancy in radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In this way, the regulation of epigenetic elements including DNA methylation and the performance of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) which is a notable epigenetic trait in GC, is of great importance. Inhibitors of DNA methylation are the first epigenetic drugs in cancer therapy. Considerably, recent studies indicate that low doses of DNMT inhibitors have a high potential in sustaining reduced DNA methylation and related with re-expression of silenced genes in tumorigenesis. Importantly, these certain doses have the ability to decrease the carcinogenesis and tumorigenesis in CSC populations within GC. Meaningly, the inhibition of DNMTs are able to reduce the accumulation of tumorigenic ability of GC CSCs. Furthermore, many epigenetic drugs have a great potential in cancer therapy, including histone methyltransferases, lysine demethylases, histone deacetylasesand, bromodomain and extra-terminal domain proteins and DNA methyltransferases inhibitors. In this review article, we try to focus on the therapeutic mechanism of DNMTs alongside with their impact on CSCs in GC.",Biomed.

31075540,PTBP1 enhances exon11a skipping in Mena pre-mRNA to promote migration and invasion in lung carcinoma cells.,"Alternative splicing (AS) events occur in the majority of human genes. AS in a single gene can give rise to different functions among multiple isoforms. Human ortholog of mammalian enabled (Mena) is a conserved regulator of actin dynamics that plays an important role in metastasis. Mena has been shown to have multiple splice variants in human tumor cells due to AS. However, the mechanism mediated Mena AS has not been elucidated. Here we showed that polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1) could modulate Mena AS. First, PTBP1 levels were elevated in metastatic lung cancer cells as well as during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Then, knockdown of PTBP1 using shRNA inhibited migration and invasion of lung carcinoma cells and decreased the Mena exon11a skipping, whereas overexpression of PTBP1 had the opposite effects. The results of RNA pull-down assays and mutation analyses demonstrated that PTBP1 functionally targeted and physically interacted with polypyrimidine sequences on both upstream intron11 (TTTTCCCCTT) and downstream intron11a (TTTTTTTTTCTTT). In addition, the results of migration and invasion assays as well as detection of filopodia revealed that the effect of PTBP1 was reversed by knockdown of Mena but not Mena11a+. Overexpressed MenaΔ11a also rescued the PTBP1-induced migration and invasion. Taken together, our study provides a novel mechanism that PTBP1 modulates Mena exon11a skipping, and indicates that PTBP1 depends on the level of Mena11a- to promote lung cancer cells migration and invasion. The regulation of Mena AS may be a potential prognostic marker and a promising target for treatment of lung carcinoma.",Biochim Biophys Acta Gene Regul Mech,2019,"['Li S', 'Shen L', 'Huang L', 'Lei S', 'Cai X', 'Breitzig M', 'Zhang B', 'Yang A', 'Ji W', 'Huang M', 'Zheng Q', 'Sun H', 'Wang F']",

Here, we demonstrate that GATA1 was upregulated in CRC tissues compared with normal tissues, and predicted poor clinical outcome in CRC. Biological functional analyses showed that GATA1 knockdown decreased CRC cells proliferation, migration and invasion, and regulated the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, silencing of GATA1 suppressed colorectal tumor growth in nude mice. Mechanistically, GATA1 overexpression significantly increased the activity of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in CRC cells.

31068593,Ribosome biogenesis during cell cycle arrest fuels EMT in development and disease.,"Ribosome biogenesis is a canonical hallmark of cell growth and proliferation. Here we show that execution of Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), a migratory cellular program associated with development and tumor metastasis, is fueled by upregulation of ribosome biogenesis during G1/S arrest. This unexpected EMT feature is independent of species and initiating signal, and is accompanied by release of the repressive nucleolar chromatin remodeling complex (NoRC) from rDNA, together with recruitment of the EMT-driving transcription factor Snai1 (Snail1), RNA Polymerase I (Pol I) and the Upstream Binding Factor (UBF). EMT-associated ribosome biogenesis is also coincident with increased nucleolar recruitment of Rictor, an essential component of the EMT-promoting mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2). Inhibition of rRNA synthesis in vivo differentiates primary tumors to a benign, Estrogen Receptor-alpha (ERα) positive, Rictor-negative phenotype and reduces metastasis.

31064190,Dynamic Changes in Circulating MicroRNA Levels in Liver Cancer Patients Undergoing Thermal Ablation and Transarterial Chemoembolization.,"BACKGROUND: Hepatic cancer patients who cannot undergo surgical resection of tumour are candidates for methods of interventional radiology - transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or thermal ablative (TA) therapy. Both methods are causing characteristic changes in liver tissue (inflammatory immune response, hypoxia, elevated temperature, tissue destruction) which are accompanied with systemic secretion of cytokines or microRNAs (miRNAs). The aim of our study was to investigate whether the level of circulating miRNAs related to hypoxia (miR-21 and miR-210), liver injury (miR-122) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (miR-200a) could reflect systemic effect of these intervention techniques.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study consisted of 10 primary hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated with TACE and 10 patients with liver metastases of colorectal cancer treated with TA. Thermal ablation was performed using the radiofrequency or microwave generator (RITA, Microsulis, AngioDynamics,Inc), for TACE drug eluting beads (DCBeads, Biocompatibles Ltd.) were used. Tumours were evaluated using RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours), mRECIST (modified RECIST) criterion and volumetry. For all patients we determined concentrations of miRNA in blood plasma samples from four time points (before intervention, immediately after intervention, 24 hours after intervention, 1 week after intervention) using TaqMan® Assays and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction method.
RESULTS: After both intervention techniques we observed changes in circulating miRNA levels. In TA cases we observed significant increase of miR-122 and miR-200a concentrations immediately after intervention, on the contrary in TACE we observed increase in miRNA concentration at time point 24 hours after intervention (miR-21, miR-210, miR-122, miR-200a). Increased concentration of circulating miRNA was followed by subsequent decline to initial level. These changes were consistent with presumed biological effect of TA and TACE on tumour tissue.
CONCLUSION: Data of this pilot study show potential usage of circulating miRNA for monitoring of systemic effect of thermal ablative and intraarterial therapies.

This study attempted to validate UCA1 possessed modulatory function on cell proliferation and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in human thyroid cancer cell line TPC-1. Ectopic expression of UCA1 was induced in TPC-1 cells by transfection. CCK-8 assays were employed to value cell viability. Cell apoptosis analysis was conducted through flow cytometry. We found that overexpressed UCA1 strongly promoted cell proliferation. However, the knockdown of UCA1 suppressed cell proliferation and induced obvious cell apoptosis. Besides, cell EMT was promoted by overexpressed UCA1 and was inhibited by the knockdown of UCA1. Further study revealed that miR-15a level in TPC-1 cells was suppressed by overexpressed UCA1. Simultaneous overexpression of UCA1 and miR-15a partly alleviated UCA1-induced growth, identifying that miR-15a was a possible target of UCA1. At last, the Hippo and JNK signal pathways were activated by overexpressed UCA1 but were then weakened by the adding of miR-15a.

It has been demonstrated that GA is more mutagenic than AA. It has been shown that the proliferation rate of some cancer cells are increased by treatment with GA; however, the exact genes that are induced by GA in most cancer cells are not clear. In the present study, we demonstrated that GA promotes the growth of prostate cancer cells through induced protein expression of the cell cycle regulator. In addition, we also found that GA promoted the migratory ability of prostate cancer cells through induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated protein expression. In order to understand the potential prognostic relevance of GA-mediated regulators of the cell cycle and EMT, we present a three-gene signature to evaluate the prognosis of prostate cancer patients. Further investigations suggested that the three-gene signature (CDK4, TWIST1 and SNAI2) predicted the chances of survival better than any of the three genes alone for the first time. In conclusion, we suggested that the three-gene signature model can act as marker of GA exposure.

31060006,"Rosmarinic inhibits cell proliferation, invasion and migration via up-regulating miR-506 and suppressing MMP2/16 expression in pancreatic cancer.","Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. However, therapeutic strategies for the treatment of pancreatic cancer are still limited. Therefore, it is urgent for us to develop novel effective therapies for pancreatic cancer. In this study, we explored the effects of rosmarinic acid on pancreatic progression and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms. Rosmarinic acid significantly suppressed cell viability, cell growth, cell invasion and migration as well as epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) of pancreatic cancer cells, and induced cell apoptosis in pancreatic cells. In addition, rosmarinic acid significantly up-regulated the expression of miR-506 in pancreatic cancer cells, and knockdown of miR-506 attenuated the suppressive effects of rosmarinic acid on cell growth, cell invasion and migration and EMT, and prevented the enhanced effects of rosmarinic acid on cell apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells. Mechanistically, the luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-506 targeted the 3' untranslated region of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/16, and miR-506 overexpression and rosmarinic acid treatment suppressed the expression of MMP2/16 in pancreatic cancer cells. Overexpression of MMP2/16 attenuated the inhibitory effects of rosmarinic acid on pancreatic cell invasion and migration. In vivo studies showed that rosmarinic acid dose-dependently suppressed tumor growth of pancreatic cancer cells, and increased the expression of miR-506, while suppressed the expression of MMP2/16 and Ki-67 in dissected tumor tissues from xenograft nude mice.

31059706,Glaucocalyxin A reverses EMT and TGF-β1-induced EMT by inhibiting TGF-β1/Smad2/3 signaling pathway in osteosarcoma.,"Metastatic osteosarcoma usually has an unsatisfactory response to the current standard chemotherapy and causes poor prognosis. Currently, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is reported as a critical event in osteosarcoma metastasis. Glaucocalyxin A, a bioactive ent-kauranoid diterpenoid, exerts anti-cancer effect on osteosarcoma by inducing apoptosis in previous study. However, the effect of Glaucocalyxin A on EMT and metastasis of osteosarcoma is unclear. In this study, we investigated the potential mechanisms of Glaucocalyxin A on EMT and metastasis of osteosarcoma. We found that Glaucocalyxin A inhibited migration and invasion of MG-63 and 143B cells. Moreover, Glaucocalyxin A increased the protein and mRNA levels of E-cadherin and decreased the protein and transcription expression of N-cadherin, Vimentin. Glaucocalyxin A also inhibited the protein and mRNA levels of EMT-associated transcription factor including Snail and Slug. Furthermore, Glaucocalyxin A inhibited transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-induced migration, invasion and EMT of low-metastatic osteosarcoma U2OS cells. Glaucocalyxin A inhibited TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of Smad 2/3 in osteosarcoma U2OS cells. Finally, we established transplanted metastatic models of highly metastatic osteosarcoma 143B cells. Glaucocalyxin A inhibited lung metastasis in vivo. Interestingly, Glaucocalyxin A increased the protein expression of E-cadherin and reduced the protein expression of N-cadherin and Vimentin. Glaucocalyxin A inhibited the protein expression of Snail and Slug in vivo. In summary, this study demonstrated that Glaucocalyxin A inhibited EMT and TGF-β1-induced EMT by inhibiting TGF-β1/Smad2/3 signaling pathway in osteosarcoma.

Elevated S100A9 expression is thought to serve an important role in tumorigenesis; however, the exact role of S100A9 in the modulation of cervical cancer and the underlying molecular mechanism remain unknown. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of S100A9 on the proliferation and migration of cervical cancer cells, as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects. Our results demonstrated that endogenous expression of S100A9 in SiHa and CaSki cell lines was significantly higher than in the HeLa cell line. As expected, overexpression of S100A9 enhanced the proliferation and migration of cervical cancer cells. In addition, S100A9 overexpression induced epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) as determined by reduced expression levels of the epithelial marker E‑cadherin, whereas the expression levels of the mesenchymal marker vimentin were upregulated. Furthermore, it was reported that the effects of S100A9 in the modulation of cervical cancer cells were mediated through the Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway as β‑catenin knockdown significantly suppressed the ability of S100A9 to enhance the proliferation and migration of cervical cancer cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that S100A9 promoted the proliferation and migration of cervical cancer cell lines. Furthermore, the underlying molecular mechanisms may be partially attributed to the induction of EMT and activation of the Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway.",Int. J.

31059001,MicroRNA‑199a‑5p suppresses migration and invasion in oral squamous cell carcinoma through inhibiting the EMT‑related transcription factor SOX4.,"MicroRNAs (miRs) are small, non‑coding RNAs that can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes in human cancer. Recent studies have revealed that miR‑199a‑5p is abnormally expressed in various types of human cancer; however, the potential role of miR‑199a‑5p in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains elusive. The present study investigated the role of miR‑199a‑5p in OSCC cells and explored the potential molecular mechanism. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to measure miR‑199a‑5p expression in OSCC tissues and adjacent normal oral epithelial tissues. Cell invasion and migration were evaluated using Transwell invasion and wound‑healing assays in OSCC cells post‑transfection with miR‑199a‑5p mimics or negative control mimics. In addition, a luciferase reporter assay was conducted to identify the target gene of miR‑199a‑5p in OSCC cells. The results demonstrated that miR‑199a‑5p expression was significantly downregulated in OSCC tissues and cell lines, and was associated with tumor progression in OSCC. Furthermore, overexpression of miR‑199a‑5p inhibited cell invasion and migration, and blocked the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) cascade. Notably, the results revealed that the EMT‑related transcription factor SRY‑box 4 (SOX4) was a direct target gene of miR‑199a‑5p, as determined by the direct binding of miR‑199a‑5p with the 3'‑untranslated region of SOX4. In addition, knockdown of SOX4 by small interfering RNA‑SOX4 suppressed proliferation, migration and invasion of OSCC cells. Conversely, overexpression of SOX4 rescued the suppressive effects of miR‑199a‑5p on cell migration and invasion. Collectively, these data indicated that miR‑199a‑5p may inhibit the migration and invasion of OSCC cells via targeting the EMT‑related transcription factor SOX4, thus suggesting that miR‑199a‑5p may serve as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in the treatment of OSCC.",Int.

31056474,Stemness underpinning all steps of human colorectal cancer defines the core of effective therapeutic strategies.,"BACKGROUND: Despite their lethality and ensuing clinical and therapeutic relevance, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from colorectal carcinoma (CRC) remain elusive, poorly characterized biological entities.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We perfected a cell system of stable, primary lines from human CRC showing that they possess the full complement of ex- and in-vivo, in xenogeneic models, characteristics of CRC stem cells (CCSCs). Here we show how tumor-initiating, CCSCs cells can establish faithful orthotopic phenocopies of the original disease, which contain cells that spread into the circulatory system. While in the vascular bed, these cells retain stemness, thus qualifying as circulating CCSCs (cCCSCs). This is followed by the establishment of lesions in distant organs, which also contain resident metastatic CCSCs (mCCSCs).
INTERPRETATION: Our results support the concept that throughout all the stages of CRC, stemness is retained as a continuous property by some of their tumor cells. Importantly, we describe a useful standardized model that can enable isolation and stable perpetuation of human CRC's CCSCs, cCCSCs and mCCSCs, providing a useful platform for studies of CRC initiation and progression that is suitable for the discovery of reliable stage-specific biomarkers and the refinement of new patient-tailored therapies.

31052313,Active Fraction from Embryo Fish Extracts Induces Reversion of the Malignant Invasive Phenotype in Breast Cancer through Down-regulation of TCTP and Modulation of E-cadherin/β-catenin Pathway.,"Some yet unidentified factors released by both oocyte and embryonic microenvironments demonstrated to be non-permissive for tumor development and display the remarkable ability to foster cell/tissue reprogramming, thus ultimately reversing the malignant phenotype. In the present study we observed how molecular factors extracted from Zebrafish embryos during specific developmental phases (20 somites) significantly antagonize proliferation of breast cancer cells, while reversing a number of prominent aspects of malignancy. Embryo extracts reduce cell proliferation, enhance apoptosis, and dramatically inhibit both invasiveness and migrating capabilities of cancer cells. Counteracting the invasive phenotype is a relevant issue in controlling tumor spreading and metastasis. Moreover, such effect is not limited to cancerous cells as embryo extracts were also effective in inhibiting migration and invasiveness displayed by normal breast cells undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition upon TGF-β1 stimulation. The reversion program involves the modulation of E-cadherin/β-catenin pathway, cytoskeleton remodeling with dramatic reduction in vinculin, as well as downregulation of TCTP and the concomitant increase in p53 levels. Our findings highlight that-contrary to the prevailing current ""dogma"", which posits that neoplastic cells are irreversibly ""committed""-the malignant phenotype can ultimately be ""reversed"", at least partially, in response to environmental morphogenetic influences.",Int J Mol Sci,2019,"['Proietti S', 'Cucina A', 'Pensotti A', 'Biava PM', 'Minini M', 'Monti N', 'Catizone A', 'Ricci G', 'Leonetti E', 'Harrath AH', 'Alwasel SH', 'Bizzarri M']",
31052182,HDAC5 Expression in Urothelial Carcinoma Cell Lines Inhibits Long-Term Proliferation but Can Promote Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition.,"Class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) generally promote cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, whereas class IIA HDACs like HDAC4 and HDAC5 may promote or impede cancer development in a tissue-dependent manner. In urothelial carcinoma (UC), HDAC5 is often downregulated. Accordingly, HDAC5 was weakly expressed in UC cell lines suggesting a possible tumor-suppressive function. We therefore characterized the effects of stable HDAC5 expression in four UC cell lines (RT112, VM-Cub-1, SW1710 and UM-UC-3) with different phenotypes reflecting the heterogeneity of UC, by assessing proliferation, clonogenicity and migration ability. Further, we detailed changes in the proteome and transcriptome by immunoblotting, mass spectrometry and RNA sequencing analysis. We observed that HDAC5 overexpression in general decreased cell proliferation, but in one cell line (VM-Cub-1) induced a dramatic change from an epitheloid to a mesenchymal phenotype, i.e., epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). These phenotypical changes were confirmed by comprehensive proteomics and transcriptomics analyses. In contrast to HDAC5, overexpression of HDAC4 exerted only weak effects on cell proliferation and phenotypes. We conclude that overexpression of HDAC5 may generally decrease proliferation in UC, but, intriguingly, may induce EMT on its own in certain circumstances.",Int J Mol Sci,2019,"['Jaguva Vasudevan AA', 'Hoffmann MJ', 'Beck MLC', 'Poschmann G', 'Petzsch P', 'Wiek C', 'Stühler K', 'Köhrer K', 'Schulz WA', 'Niegisch G']",
31050003,Inflammatory mediators of prostate epithelial cells stimulated with Trichomonas vaginalis promote proliferative and invasive properties of prostate cancer cells.,"BACKGROUND: Trichomonas vaginalis (Tv) is the most common sexually transmitted parasite. It is detected in prostatic tissue of benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatitis, and prostate cancer (PCa) and has been suggested to cause chronic prostatitis. Moreover, up to 20% of all cancers worldwide are associated with chronic inflammation. Here, we investigated whether inflammatory mediators produced by normal human prostate epithelial cells (RWPE-1) stimulated with Tv could promote growth and invasiveness of PCa cells.
METHODS: Conditioned medium of RWPE-1 cells was prepared by stimulating them with Tv (trichomonad-conditioned medium [TCM]) and without Tv (conditioned medium [CM]). Promotion of PCa cells (PC3, DU145, and LNCaP) was assessed by wound healing, proliferation, and invasion assays.
RESULTS: We observed that the production of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, CCL2, CXCL8, prostaglandin-E2 (PGE

31042721,The association and prognostic impact of enhancer of zeste homologue 2 expression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in resected lung adenocarcinoma.,"OBJECTIVES: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the histone methyltransferase Enhancer of Zeste Homologue 2 (EZH2) are important regulators of lung cancer progression and metastasis. Although recent studies support the correlation between EZH2 expression and EMT, no reports have investigated their association using immunohistochemistry or explored their prognostic impact on lung adenocarcinoma. The aim of this study was to elucidate the association between EZH2 and EMT, and their prognostic significance.
METHODS: EZH2 and the EMT markers E-cadherin and Vimentin were examined by IHC in lung adenocarcinoma specimens that were resected from 2003-2012. Associations between EZH2 and EMT markers and their correlations with survival were analyzed.
RESULTS: We enrolled 350 patients, approximately 70% of whom were diagnosed as pathological stage I. The rates of positive E-cadherin, Vimentin, and EZH2 expression were 60.3%, 21.4%, and 52.0%, respectively. There was a significant positive correlation between EZH2 and Vimentin expression (p = 0.008), and EZH2 scores were higher in the Mesenchymal group (p = 0.030). In multivariate analysis, EZH2 was an independent predictor of Vimentin expression, and vice versa. EMT and EZH2 overexpression were significantly correlated with poor disease-free and overall survival. Furthermore, the Epithelial group with high EZH2 expression had significantly worse disease-free and overall survival. Positive staining for EMT markers was unfavorable regarding disease-free survival among patients with low EZH2 expression.
CONCLUSIONS: EMT and high EZH2 expression were associated with poor NSCLC prognoses.

This study aimed to investigate the regulatory effects and mechanisms of SALL1 gene expression in human glioblastoma and glioma cells and tissue samples from patients with cerebral glioma. MATERIAL AND METHODS The human glioblastoma cell lines, LN229, U87-MG, U-251, U343, and the Hs683 glioma cell line were studied. The cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, cell cycle assay, wound-healing assay, transwell assay, Western blot, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were used to evaluate cell proliferation, cell migration, and the cell cycle and expression of SALL1. Expression of SALL1 mRNA in 120 samples of cerebral glioma and 20 samples of normal brain were studied. Overall survival data from patients with cerebral glioma were analyzed. RESULTS SALL1 expression was down-regulated in human glioblastoma and glioma cells and in cerebral glioma tissues. Down-regulation of SALL1 expression was associated with reduced overall survival. Overexpression of SALL1 was associated with inhibition of cell proliferation associated with cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. SALL1 inhibited cell migration by preventing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and down-regulating the expression of stem cell markers. Reduced levels of ß-catenin and downregulation of c-Myc and cyclin D1 and upregulation of p21and p27 expression were associated with SALL1 expression. CONCLUSIONS In human glioblastoma cells and cerebral glioma tissues, SALL1 acted as a tumor suppressor gene by inhibiting Wnt/ß-catenin signaling.",Med Sci Monit Basic Res,2019,"['Chi D', 'Zhang W', 'Jia Y', 'Cong D', 'Hu S']",
31038558,EVALUATING MMP-2 AND TGFß-RI EXPRESSION IN CIRCULATING TUMOR CELLS OF PANCREATIC CANCER PATIENTS AND THEIR CORRELATION WITH CLINICAL EVOLUTION.,"BACKGROUND: Metastasis is common in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, and the presence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers in circulating tumor cells may suggest worse prognosis.
AIM: To correlate the number of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the peripheral blood of patients with a locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic tumor and the protein expression involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in CTCs with clinical characteristics, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
METHOD: This was a prospective study conducted using peripheral blood samples collected at three different times. CTCs were quantified by the ISET test and analyzed by immunocytochemistry. Proteins involved in EMT (vimentin, TGFß-RI and MMP2) were analyzed in all CTCs.
RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were included. Median CTCs detected were 22, 20 and 8 CTCs/8 ml blood at baseline, first and second follow-up, respectively. No statistically significant correlation was found in correlating the number of CTCs and the evaluated clinical characteristics, PFS, or OS. There was no difference in PFS and OS among the EMT markers in the groups with and without markers.
CONCLUSION: CTC analysis was not relevant in this sample for comparing clinical findings, PFS and OS in patients with pancreatic cancer. However, marker analysis in CTCs could be useful for the MMP-2 and/or TGFß-RI expression, as observed by the separate PFS curve.",Arq Bras Cir Dig,2019,"['Gasparini-Junior JL', 'Fanelli MF', 'Abdallah EA', 'Chinen LTD']",

31035951,Hsa_circ_0005379 regulates malignant behavior of oral squamous cell carcinoma through the EGFR pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is an oral and maxillofacial malignancy with a high incidence worldwide. Accumulating evidence indicates that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a vital role in modulating tumor development. However, the mechanism of circRNA action in human OSCC remains largely unknown.
METHODS: By using high-throughput transcriptome sequencing technology, we conducted a comprehensive study of circRNAs in human OSCC. The effect of circRNA hsa_circ_0005379 on OSCC tissues and cell lines was monitored by qRT-PCR, Transwell assay, flow cytometry, and western blot analysis. Xenograft mouse models were used to assess tumor growth and animal survival.
RESULTS: We found that circRNA hsa_circ_0005379 expression is significantly lower in OSCC tissue compared to paired non-cancerous matched tissue and is associated with tumor size and differentiation. Overexpression of hsa_circ_0005379 effectively inhibits migration, invasion, and proliferation of OSCC cells in vitro and suppresses OSCC growth in nude mice in vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed that hsa_circ_0005379 may be involved in the regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. Furthermore, we found that high expression of hsa_circ_0005379 could significantly enhance the sensitivity of OSCC to the cetuximab drug.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence that hsa_circ_0005379 regulates OSCC malignancy and may be a new therapeutic target for OSCC treatment.",BMC Cancer,2019,"['Su W', 'Wang Y', 'Wang F', 'Sun S', 'Li M', 'Shen Y', 'Yang H']",
31035725,The Inhibitory Effect of Propylene Glycol Alginate Sodium Sulfate on Fibroblast Growth Factor 2-Mediated Angiogenesis and Invasion in Murine Melanoma B16-F10 Cells In Vitro.,"Melanoma is one of the most malignant and aggressive types of cancer worldwide. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is one of the critical regulators of melanoma angiogenesis and metastasis; thus, it might be an effective anti-cancer strategy to explore FGF2-targeting drug candidates from existing drugs. In this study, we evaluate the effect of the marine drug propylene glycol alginate sodium sulfate (PSS) on FGF2-mediated angiogenesis and invasion. The data shows that FGF2 selectively bound to PSS with high affinity. PSS inhibited FGF2-mediated angiogenesis in a rat aortic ring model and suppressed FGF2-mediated invasion, but not the migration of murine melanoma B16-F10 cells. The further mechanism study indicates that PSS decreased the expression of activated matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), and also suppressed their activity. In addition, PSS was found to decrease the level of Vimentin in B16-F10 cells, which is known to participate in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Notably, PSS did not elicit any changes in cancer cell viability. Based on the results above, we conclude that PSS might be a potential drug to regulate the tumor microenvironment in order to facilitate the recovery of melanoma patients.",Mar Drugs,2019,"['Ma H', 'Qiu P', 'Xu H', 'Xu X', 'Xin M', 'Chu Y', 'Guan H', 'Li C', 'Yang J']",
31029128,Paracrine effects of CCN3 from non-cancerous hepatic cells increase signaling and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: The liver microenvironment plays a key role in the progression and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Gene expression profiling of non-cancerous hepatic tissues obtained from patients with metastatic HCC exhibit a unique immune response signature, including upregulation of CCN3. However, the role of CCN3 secreted from non-cancerous hepatic tissues in the progression of HCC remains unclear.
METHODS: Using tissue microarrays, we examined CCN3 in non-cancerous hepatic tissues of patients with HCC and correlated expression with clinical and pathological features. In addition, CCN3 localization and mechanisms of HCC progression were investigated in tissues and cell lines. Finally, correlations between CCN3 and cirrhosis were explored in patients.
RESULTS: CCN3 was primarily localized to hepatic cells of non-cancerous hepatic tissues and was associated with vascular invasion and poor prognosis in patients with HCC. CCN3 expression in non-cancerous hepatic tissues also correlated with the degree of liver fibrosis. Compared with conditioned media from wild-type LO2 cells, conditioned media from hepatic cell line LO2 activated by LX2 (aLO2-CM) induced CCN3 expression and HCC cell proliferation and metastasis. Further, aLO2-CM activated MAPK signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in HCC cells. Finally, CCN3 was inversely related to cirrhosis in the prognosis of HCC and negatively regulated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in vitro with downregulation of α-SMA, TGF-β, and collagens.
CONCLUSIONS: CCN3 was secreted from hepatic cells activated by HSCs and increased MAPK signaling, EMT, proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells.

31026378,The encouraging role of long noncoding RNA small nuclear RNA host gene 16 in epithelial-mesenchymal transition of bladder cancer via directly acting on miR-17-5p/metalloproteinases 3 axis.,"The present investigation was intended to elucidate whether long noncoding RNA small nuclear RNA host gene 16 (SNHG16) could regulate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process of bladder cancer cells by directing expressions of miR-17-5p and metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP3). To elucidate the point, we collected 275 pairs of bladder cancer tissues and corresponding adjacent normal tissues, as well as four bladder cancer cell lines and the normal human bladder epithelial cell line. Moreover, pcDNA3.1-SNHG16, si-SNHG16, miR-17-5p mimic, miR-17-5p inhibitor, pcDNA3.1-TIMP3, and si-TIMP3 were prepared for transfection, and CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, wound healing assay, and transwell assay were carried out. Finally, the dual luciferase reporter gene assay was performed to figure out whether targeted regulations were present among SNHG16, miR-17-5p, and TIMP3. The laboratory findings demonstrated that the bladder cancer patients carrying under-expressed SNHG16 or miR-17-5p were associated with extended survival time when compared with those possessing overexpressed SNHG16 and miR-17-5p (P < 0.05). Furthermore, overexpression of SNHG16 and miR-17-5p both enhanced the viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion (P < 0.05), and simultaneously suppressed their apoptosis (P < 0.05). Transfections of pcDNA3.1-SNHG16 and si-SNHG16, respectively, resulted in overexpression and under-expression of miR-17-5p, and the dual luciferase reporter gene assay demonstrated a targeted relationship between SNHG16 and miR-17-5p (P < 0.05). Besides, the expression of TIMP3 was subjected to targeted regulation of miR-17-5p (P < 0.05), and its overexpression could reverse the effects of miR-17-5p on proliferation and metastasis (P < 0.05).

Recent studies have indicated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) played crucial roles in thyroid cancer tumorigenesis and progression. However, the roles of most lncRNAs in thyroid cancer were still unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS We used TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas), GSE50901, GSE29265, and GSE33630 datasets to analyze the expression pattern of ZFAS1 (ZNFX1 antisense RNA 1). The correlation between ZFAS1 and clinicopathological features in thyroid cancer was analyzed. Cell proliferation and cell cycle assays were used to validate the roles of ZFAS1 in thyroid cancer cell lines. DAVID (the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discover) system was used to perform GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analysis. The starBase datasets and Cytoscape was used to perform ceRNA (competitive endogenous RNA) network. RESULTS We demonstrated ZFAS1 was highly expressed in thyroid cancer compared to normal samples. Moreover, upregulation of ZFAS1 was positively correlated with clinicopathological features and poor prognosis in thyroid cancer. Functional validation showed knockdown of ZFAS1 suppressed cell proliferation and cell cycle in thyroid cancer cells. Bioinformatics analysis showed ZFAS1 was associated with translation, rRNA processing, intra-Golgi vesicle-mediated transport, ribosome, and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis.

31011939,"The Role Played by SLUG, an Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Factor, in Invasion and Therapeutic Resistance of Malignant Glioma.","In malignant gliomas, invasive phenotype and cancer stemness promoting resurgence of residual tumor cells render treatment very difficult. Hence, identification of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) factors associated with invasion and stemness of glioma cells is critical. To address the issue, we investigated several EMT factors in hypermotile U87MG and U251 cells, orthotopic mouse glioma model, and human glioma samples. Of several EMT markers, SLUG expression was notably increased at the invasive fronts of gliomas, both in mouse tumor grafts and human glioma samples. The biological role played by SLUG was investigated using a colony-forming assay after chemotherapy and irradiation, and by employing a neurosphere culture assay. The effect of SLUG on glioma progression was examined in our patient cohort and samples, and compared to large public data from the REMBRANDT and TCGA. Genetic upregulation of SLUG was associated with increased levels of stemness factors and enhanced resistance to radiation and temozolomide. In our cohort, patients exhibiting lower-level SLUG expression evidenced longer progression-free survival (P = 0.042). Also, in the REMBRANDT dataset, a group in which SLUG was downregulated exhibited a significant survival benefit (P < 0.001). Although paired glioblastoma samples from our patients did not show a significant increase of SLUG expression, increased mRNA levels of SLUG were found in recurrent glioblastoma from TCGA (P = 0.052), and in temozolomide-treated glioma cells and mouse tumor grafts. SLUG may contribute to glioma progression by controlling invasion at infiltrating margins, associated with increased stemness and therapeutic resistance.",Cell. Mol.

METHODS: CASC19 expression in human CRC tissues, pair-matched adjacent normal colon tissues, and CRC cells was detected using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). CASC19 expression, as well as its relation to overall survival, was extrapolated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis together with multivariable Cox regression assay. 
RESULTS: CASC19 expression was markedly upregulated in CRC tissues and CRC cell lines (
CONCLUSION: CASC19 positively regulates CEMIP expression through targeting miR-140-5p. CASC19 may possess an oncogenic function in CRC progression, highlighting its potential as an essential biomarker in CRC diagnosis and therapy.",World J.

31010590,"Fibrillin-1, a novel TGF-beta-induced factor, is preferentially expressed in metaplastic carcinoma with spindle sarcomatous metaplasia.","TGF-β induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is involved in tumour progression. This study aims to identify and characterise novel factors potentially related to TGF-β-mediated tumour aggression in breast cancer. We treated the human mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A with TGF-β and observed TGF-β-dependent upregulation of FBN1, involving demethylation of CpG sites, in MCF10A cells undergoing EMT. The biological importance of fibrillin-1, encoded by FBN1, was evaluated through immunohistochemistry on 225 breast cancer specimens of various subtypes. Fibrillin-1 expression was observed only in metaplastic carcinoma of the breast (MCB) (51.7%), and the expression was observed in spindle sarcomatous metaplasia (SSM), but not in other metaplasia, including matrix-producing, pleomorphic, and squamous metaplasia, and carcinomatous components of both MCB and non-MCB. Fibrillin-1 expression was also restricted to the SSM of non-mammary carcinosarcomas of various organs. Overall, fibrillin-1 expression was enriched in MCB and non-mammary carcinosarcoma with SSM (93.7% and 93.3%, respectively), but not in MCBs and non-mammary carcinosarcoma without SSM. FBN1 knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells with high FBN1 expression did not compromise migration, invasion, and tumourigenesis, and did not alter the expression of other EMT-related markers. In conclusion, fibrillin-1 is a novel TGF-β-induced marker. Fibrillin-1 expression in SSM, but not in other metaplasia and carcinomatous components, in both MCBs and non-mammary carcinosarcomas, together with the inability of FBN1-knockdown to compromise migration and invasion, indicates that fibrillin-1 is a marker induced solely in spindle metaplasia during EMT and does not induce EMT nor lead to tumour aggressiveness.",Pathology,2019,"['Lien HC', 'Lee YH', 'Juang YL', 'Lu YT']",
31010154,The Crosstalk Between Cell Adhesion and Cancer Metabolism.,"Cancer cells preferentially use aerobic glycolysis over mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation for energy production, and this metabolic reprogramming is currently recognized as a hallmark of cancer. Oncogenic signaling frequently converges with this metabolic shift, increasing cancer cells' ability to produce building blocks and energy, as well as to maintain redox homeostasis. Alterations in cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion promote cancer cell invasion, intravasation, anchorage-independent survival in circulation, and extravasation, as well as homing in a distant organ. Importantly, during this multi-step metastatic process, cells need to induce metabolic rewiring, in order to produce the energy needed, as well as to impair oxidative stress. Although the individual implications of adhesion molecules and metabolic reprogramming in cancer have been widely explored over the years, the crosstalk between cell adhesion molecular machinery and metabolic pathways is far from being clearly understood, in both normal and cancer contexts. This review summarizes our understanding about the influence of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion in the metabolic behavior of cancer cells, with a special focus concerning the role of classical cadherins, such as Epithelial (E)-cadherin and Placental (P)-cadherin.",Int J Mol Sci,2019,"['Sousa B', 'Pereira J', 'Paredes J']",

31008529,Polycomb complex mediated epigenetic reprogramming alters TGF-β signaling via a novel EZH2/miR-490/TGIF2 axis thereby inducing migration and EMT potential in glioblastomas.,"Recent advancement in understanding cancer etiology has highlighted epigenetic deregulation as an important phenomenon leading to poor prognosis in glioblastoma (GBM). Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is one such important epigenetic modifier reportedly altered in GBM. However, its defined mechanism in tumorigenesis still remains elusive. In present study, we analyzed our in-house ChIPseq data for H3k27me3 modified miRNAs and identified miR-490-3p to be the most common target in GBM with significantly downregulated expression in glioma patients in both TCGA and GBM patient cohort. Our functional analysis delineates for the first time, a central role of PRC2 catalytic unit EZH2 in directly regulating expression of this miRNA and its host gene CHRM2 in GBM. In accordance, cell line treatment with EZH2 siRNA and 5-azacytidine also confirmed its coregulation by CpG and histone methylation based epigenetic mechanisms. Furthermore, induced overexpression of miR-490-3p in GBM cell lines significantly inhibited key hallmarks including cellular proliferation, colony formation and spheroid formation, as well as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), with downregulation of multiple EMT transcription factors and promigratory genes (MMP9, CCL5, PIK3R1, ICAM1, ADAM17 and NOTCH1). We also for the first time report TGFBR1 and TGIF2 as two direct downstream effector targets of miR-490-3p that are also deregulated in GBM. TGIF2, a novel target, was shown to promote migration and EMT that could partially be rescued by miR-490-3p overexpression. Overall, this stands as a first study that provides a direct link between epigenetic modulator EZH2 and oncogenic TGF-β signaling involving novel miR-490-3p/TGIF2/TGFBR1 axis, that being targetable might be promising in developing new therapeutic intervention strategies for GBM.",Int.

31004547,Repressive role of stabilized hypoxia inducible factor 1α expression on transforming growth factor β-induced extracellular matrix production in lung cancer cells.,"Activation of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) combined with persistent hypoxia often affects the tumor microenvironment. Disruption of cadherin/catenin complexes induced by these stimulations yields aberrant extracellular matrix (ECM) production, characteristics of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF), the hallmark of the response to hypoxia, play differential roles during development of diseases. Recent studies show that localization of cadherin/catenin complexes at the cell membrane might be tightly regulated by protein phosphatase activity. We aimed to investigate the role of stabilized HIF-1α expression by protein phosphatase activity on dissociation of the E-cadherin/β-catenin complex and aberrant ECM expression in lung cancer cells under stimulation by TGF-β. By using lung cancer cells treated with HIF-1α stabilizers or carrying doxycycline-dependent HIF-1α deletion or point mutants, we investigated the role of stabilized HIF-1α expression on TGF-β-induced EMT in lung cancer cells. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms were determined by inhibition of protein phosphatase activity. Persistent stimulation by TGF-β and hypoxia induced EMT phenotypes in H358 cells in which stabilized HIF-1α expression was inhibited. Stabilized HIF-1α protein expression inhibited the TGF-β-stimulated appearance of EMT phenotypes across cell types and species, independent of de novo vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression. Inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A activity abrogated the HIF-1α-induced repression of the TGF-β-stimulated appearance of EMT phenotypes. This is the first study to show a direct role of stabilized HIF-1α expression on inhibition of TGF-β-induced EMT phenotypes in lung cancer cells, in part, through protein phosphatase activity.",Cancer Sci.,2019,"['Ando A', 'Hashimoto N', 'Sakamoto K', 'Omote N', 'Miyazaki S', 'Nakahara Y', 'Imaizumi K', 'Kawabe T', 'Hasegawa Y']",
31004257,The YB-1/EZH2/amphiregulin signaling axis mediates LPA-induced breast cancer cell invasion.,"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) has been known to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to stimulate cancer cell invasion, and resveratrol (3,5,4'-trans-trihydroxystilbene; REV) suppresses the invasion and metastasis of various cancers. The current study aimed to identify the underlying mechanism by which LPA aggravates breast cancer cell invasion and the reversal of this phenomenon. Immunoblotting and quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that LPA induces amphiregulin (AREG) expression. Silencing of Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1) or enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) expression efficiently inhibited LPA-induced AREG expression. In addition, transfection of the cells with YB-1 siRNA abrogated LPA-induced EZH2 and AREG expression, leading to attenuation of breast cancer cell invasion. Furthermore, we observed that both REV and 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) significantly reduce LPA-induced YB-1 phosphorylation and subsequent breast cancer invasion. Importantly, combined treatment of REV with 5-Fu showed more significant inhibition of LPA-induced breast cancer invasion compared to single treatment. Therefore, our data demonstrate that the YB-1/EZH2 signaling axis mediates LPA-induced AREG expression and breast cancer cell invasion and its inhibition by REV and 5-Fu, providing potential therapeutic targets and inhibition of breast cancer.",Arch.

31003545,Long Noncoding RNA and Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition in Cancer.,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a multistep process that allows epithelial cells to acquire mesenchymal properties. Fundamental in the early stages of embryonic development, this process is aberrantly activated in aggressive cancerous cells to gain motility and invasion capacity, thus promoting metastatic phenotypes. For this reason, EMT is a central topic in cancer research and its regulation by a plethora of mechanisms has been reported. Recently, genomic sequencing and functional genomic studies deepened our knowledge on the fundamental regulatory role of noncoding DNA. A large part of the genome is transcribed in an impressive number of noncoding RNAs. Among these, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to control several biological processes affecting gene expression at multiple levels from transcription to protein localization and stability. Up to now, more than 8000 lncRNAs were discovered as selectively expressed in cancer cells. Their elevated number and high expression specificity candidate these molecules as a valuable source of biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. Rising evidence currently highlights a relevant function of lncRNAs on EMT regulation defining a new layer of involvement of these molecules in cancer biology. In this review we aim to summarize the findings on the role of lncRNAs on EMT regulation and to discuss their prospective potential value as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer.",Int J Mol Sci,2019,"['Gugnoni M', 'Ciarrocchi A']",
31002970,PM2.5 induces EMT and promotes CSC properties by activating Notch pathway in vivo and vitro.,"Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been closely linked to increased morbidity and mortality of lung cancer worldwide. However, the role of PM2.5 in the etiology of lung cancer and the mechanism involved in PM2.5 induced lung cancer are largely unknown. In this study, we performed chronic exposure animal model to investigate the carcinogenetic mechanisms of PM2.5 by targeting the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cells (CSC) properties through Notch1 signal pathway. The antagonism of Notch1 signal pathway was carried out in vitro cell lines of A549 and BEAS-2B to block EMT and CSC. We found that chronic PM2.5 exposure mice lung tissue pathology showed atypical hyperplasia of bronchiolar epithelium. Then, we discovered that chronic PM2.5 exposure induced notable EMT event and obvious CSC properties indicating the developing process of cell malignant behaviors. EMT characterized with decreased protein expression of E-cadherin and increased protein expression of Vimentin. CSC properties induced by chronic PM2.5 exposure characterized with increased cell-surface markers (ABCG2 and ALDH1A1) and self-renewal genes (SOX2 and OCT4). Furthermore, PM2.5 exposure activate Notch signal pathway by increasing expression of Notch1 and Hes1. At last, we blocked Notch signal pathway by inhibitor RO4929097 in vitro to explore the underlying mechanism mediating PM2.5 induced EMT and CSC. We found that blocking Notch1 could prevent PM2.5 induced malignant behaviors including EMT and CSC in A549 and BEAS-2B. These data revealed that the induction of EMT and CSC properties were involved in the lung cancer risk of PM2.5 in vivo, and blocking-up Notch1 may negatively regulate EMT and CSC to suppress the invasion and migration in vitro, thereby putatively serving as a novel therapeutic target for PM2.5 induced lung cancer.",Ecotoxicol.

31002892,"NF-κB inhibitor, BAY11-7082, suppresses M2 tumor-associated macrophage induced EMT potential via miR-30a/NF-κB/Snail signaling in bladder cancer cells.","BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammatory microenvironment has been shown to play a key role in initiating tumorigenesis and facilitating malignant progression. Primary tumors surrounded with and infiltrated by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) significantly promote the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and distant metastasis in urothelial bladder cancer.
METHODS: In this study, we aimed to explore the potential of targeting TAMs for the treatment of malignant bladder cancer.
RESULTS: First, we found a higher number of TAMs, CD68 (pan-macrophage marker), and clever-1 (M2 macrophage marker) was associated with a higher pT category and grade in a cohort of 108 patients. In vitro assays showed that the co-culture of TAMs promoted the metastatic potential in HTB-1 and T24 by up-regulating EMT markers including Snail, VEGF and Vimentin, as well as oncogenic markers such as β-catenin and NF-κB. More importantly, M2 co-cultured HTB-1 and T24 showed an increased level of metastatic microRNA, miR-30. Silencing of miR-30 resulted in the reduced metastatic potential, migration/invasion, in association with the decreased expression of Twist1 and Vimentin. The addition of BAY11-7082 into the TAM/cancer co-culture system significantly reduced the M2 phenotype and tumorigenic properties. Coincidentally, miR-30a level was significantly lowered in the presence of BAY11-7082.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that AMs promoted metastatic potential of bladder cancer cells via promoting EMT through the increase of miR-30a. BAY11-7082 treatment suppressed both oncogenic and metastatic potential in bladder cancer cells while preventing the M2 polarization of TAMs.",Gene,2019,"['Zhang Q', 'Mao Z', 'Sun J']",
31002376,Pomolic acid exhibits anticancer potential against a docetaxel‑resistant PC3 prostate cell line.,"Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the leading causes of cancer‑related death in the male population worldwide. Mortality of PC is dependent on tumor recurrence and its progression to metastatic disease. We examined the effects of pentacyclic triterpene pomolic acid (PA) on docetaxel‑resistant PC3 cells. Cell viability was evaluated using the MTT assay. Apoptosis was evaluated by cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry. The activity of multiple drug resistance (MDR) proteins was determined by the accumulation of specific substrates [mitoxantrone, rhodamine 123 and 5‑carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA)]. The evaluation of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) proteins was conducted by immunocytochemical assays. It was demonstrated that PC3R cells presents multidrug resistance and EMT phenotype and express active P‑gp/ABCB1 and MRP1/ABCC1. It was shown that PA strongly reduced the viability and induced apoptosis of both PC3 and PC3R cell lines. Moreover, PA bypassed P‑gp/ABCB1, downmodulated MRP1/ABCC1 activities, and partially reverted EMT induced by DTX. Our goal was to evaluate the potential of PA for the development of novel strategies to treat castration‑resistant PC.",Oncol. Rep.,2019,"['Martins CA', 'Rocha GDG', 'Gattass CR', 'Takiya CM']",
31000382,Overexpression of FER1L4 promotes the apoptosis and suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stemness markers via activating PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in osteosarcoma cells.,"Novel long non-coding RNA Fer-1-like protein 4 (FER1L4) has been identified as a tumor suppressor in endometrial carcinoma, ovarian cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. However, the function of FER1L4 in osteosarcoma has not been clear. The aim of the research was to explore the effects of FER1L4 in osteosarcoma. Results showed that FER1L4 was observed to be lowly expressed in osteosarcoma cell lines (US-O2, MG-63 and SaOS-2 cells), especially MG63 cells. Besides, overexpression of FER1L4 remarkably repressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of MG63 cells. FER1L4-induced apoptotic cell death leaded to the activation of caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl2. Moreover, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was tremendously suppressed by increased FER1L4, evidences were the increased E-cadherin and reduced vimentin and fibronectin. Blocking FER1L4 expression by sh-FER1L4 treatment increased the expression of SOX9, CD44, ALDH1, Nanog and Oct4, indicating that FER1L4 could effectively decrease cell stemness in osteosarcoma. Furthermore, the protein levels of p-AKT and p-PI3K were remarkably suppressed when FER1L4 was knocked down. In conclusion, the study indicated that FER1L4 acted as a tumor suppressor in osteosarcoma via activating PI3K/AKT pathway may be a new prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for osteosarcoma intervention.",Pathol.

30999932,Resolvin D1 prevents epithelial-mesenchymal transition and reduces the stemness features of hepatocellular carcinoma by inhibiting paracrine of cancer-associated fibroblast-derived COMP.,"BACKGROUND: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) require stromal signals for maintaining pluripotency and self-renewal capacities to confer tumor metastasis. Resolvin D1 (RvD1), an endogenous anti-inflammatory lipid mediator, has recently been identified to display anti-cancer effects by acting on stroma cells. Our previous study reveals that hepatic stellate cells (HSCs)-derived cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) contributes to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. However, whether RvD1 inhibits paracrine of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)-derived COMP to prevent epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stemness in HCC remains to be elucidated.
METHODS: CAFs were isolated from HCC tissues. Direct and indirect co-culture models were established to analyze the interactions between HCC cells and CAFs in the presence of RvD1 in vitro. The transwell and tumor sphere formation assays were used to determine invasion and stemness of HCC cells. The subcutaneous tumor formation and orthotopic liver tumor models were established by co-implantation of CAFs and HCC cells to evaluate the role of RvD1 in vivo. To characterize the mechanism of RvD1 inhibited paracrine of COMP in CAFs, various signaling molecules were analyzed by ELISA, western blotting, reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection, immunofluorescence staining, dual luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.
RESULTS: Our data revealed that RvD1 treatment can impede the CAFs-induced cancer stem-like properties and the EMT of HCC cells under co-culture conditions. In vivo studies indicated that RvD1 intervention repressed the promoting effects of CAFs on tumor growth and metastasis of HCC. Furthermore, RvD1 inhibited CAF-induced EMT and stemness features of HCC cells by suppressing the secretion of COMP. Mechanistically, formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) receptor mediated the suppressive effects of RvD1 on COMP and forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) expression in CAFs. Notably, RvD1 impaired CAF-derived COMP in a paracrine manner by targeting FPR2/ROS/FOXM1 signaling to ultimately abrogate FOXM1 recruitment to the COMP promoter.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that RvD1 impaired paracrine of CAFs-derived COMP by targeting FPR2/ROS/FOXM1 signaling to repress EMT and cancer stemness in HCC. Thus, RvD1 may be a potential agent to promote treatment outcomes in HCC.",J. Exp. Clin.

However, the NAV2 gene expression changes and its role in the pathogenesis of cutaneous melanoma have not been clearly illustrated. Further investigations of NAV2 in cutaneous melanoma may provide new mechanistic insight and treatment strategy for this disease. Through immunohistochemistry assay and bioinformatics analysis, we found that melanoma tissues showed an upregulated expression of NAV2 which correlated with poor prognosis of cutaneous melanoma. To investigate the effect of NAV2 on the proliferation and invasion of melanoma, shNAV2 and NAV2-cDNA were transfected into melanoma cell lines. NAV2 overexpression significantly promoted melanoma cell proliferation, migration and invasion, while NAV2 silencing effectively inhibited this process. The potential underlying mechanisms were investigated using bioinformatics analysis, qRT-PCR, and western blot. Results showed that NAV2-mediated invasion of melanoma cells was driven by enhanced epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which was resulted from SNAI2 upregulation via the GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway. This study suggested that NAV2 could induce melanoma proliferation and invasion by epithelial-mesenchymal transition through the GSK-3β/β-catenin-SNAI2 pathway.

However, the clinical significance and the molecular mechanisms of PC4 in breast cancer development and progression are still unknown.
METHODS: We investigated PC4 expression in 114 cases of primary breast cancer and matched normal breast tissue specimens, and studied the impact of PC4 expression as well as the molecular mechanisms of this altered expression on breast cancer growth and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: PC4 was significantly upregulated in breast cancer and high PC4 expression was positively correlated with metastasis and poor prognosis of patients. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) demonstrated that the gene sets of cell proliferation and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) were positively correlated with elevated PC4 expression. Consistently, loss of PC4 markedly inhibited the growth and metastasis of breast cancer both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, PC4 exerted its oncogenic functions by directly binding to c-Myc promoters and inducing Warburg effect.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which IL-6 induce breast cancer cells epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) and stemness remain elusive.
METHODS: Breast cancer cell lines T47D and MCF7 were exposed to IL-6, the expression of PIM1 was examined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot. Luciferase reporter assay was used to determine the transcriptional modulation of PIM1 by IL-6 and STAT3 inhibitor. Transwell assay was used to detect the invading ability of breast cancer cells induced by IL-6 or PIM1. The expressions of EMT and stemness markers were determined by qRT-PCR.
RESULTS: IL-6 promoted PIM1 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and this induction could be abrogated by inhibiting STAT3 activation, subsequently suppressing the transcriptional level of PIM1. Moreover, we noticed that knocking down of PIM1 in cells which was exposed to IL-6 significantly impaired the invasion ability and the expression of EMT and stemness markers. On the contrary, overexpression of PIM1 promoted cell invasion and upregulated the expression of EMT and stemness markers. In addition, we demonstrated that c-myc, the cofactor of PIM1, involved in the pro-oncogenic roles of PIM1. Knocking down of c-myc attenuated the PIM1-induced cell EMT and stemness.
CONCLUSION: This study proposed the upregulation of PIM1 by IL-6 contributed to breast cancer cell aggressiveness and targeting PIM1 or c-myc could be novel approaches for breast cancer treatment.",Breast Cancer,2019,"['Gao X', 'Liu X', 'Lu Y', 'Wang Y', 'Cao W', 'Liu X', 'Hu H', 'Wang H']",

METHODS: TCGA database was used to identify the involvement of LINC01354 in CRC. qRT-PCR and western blot were used to determine RNA and protein expression. The gain- and loss-of-function assays were conducted to explore the function of LINC01354 in the progression of CRC. In order to investigate the LINC01354-mediated mRNA in CRC tumorigenesis, we applied the profiling analysis as well as GO and KEGG analysis. Pulldown and RIP assays were applied to detect the interaction of hnRNP-D with LINC01354 and β-catenin.
RESULTS: The upregulation of LINC01354 in CRC and its prognostic significance were identified by TCGA database and confirmed in CRC tissues.

30987656,A positive feedback loop consisting of C12orf59/NF-κB/CDH11 promotes gastric cancer invasion and metastasis.,"BACKGROUND: Metastasis remains the main cause of cancer-related death for gastric cancer (GC) patients, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data base and bioinformatics analyses, we identified C12orf59 might act as a potential oncogenic protein in GC.
METHODS: We investigate the expression pattern and clinical significance of C12orf59 in two independent cohorts of GC samples. In the training cohort, we used the X-tile program software to generate the optimal cutoff value for C12orf59 expression in order to classify patients accurately according to clinical outcome. In the validation cohort, this derived cutoff score was applied to exam the association of C12orf59 expression with survival outcome. A series of in vivo and in vitro assays were then performed to investigate the function of C12orf59 in GC.
RESULTS: C12orf59 was significantly upregulated, and associated with poor survival outcome in two cohorts of GC samples. Gain- and loss of- function studies demonstrated C12orf59 promotes GC cell invasive and metastatic capacity both in vitro and in vivo, and induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis. Mechanically, C12orf59 exerts oncogenic functions by up-regulating CDH11 expression via NF-κB signaling. Interesting, CDH11 could in turn promote NF-κB bind to C12orf59's promoter and form a positive feedback loop to sustain the metastatic ability of GC cells. Additionally, downregulation of miR-654-5p is another important mechanism for C12orf59 overexpression in GC.
CONCLUSION: Our finding suggested the newly identified C12orf59/NF-κB/CDH11 feedback loop may represent a new strategy for GC treatment.",J. Exp. Clin.

30987073,AICAR Induces Apoptosis and Inhibits Migration and Invasion in Prostate Cancer Cells Through an AMPK/mTOR-Dependent Pathway.,"Current clinical challenges of prostate cancer management are to restrict tumor growth and prohibit metastasis. AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carbox-amide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside), an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) agonist, has demonstrated antitumor activities for several types of cancers. However, the activity of AICAR on the cell growth and metastasis of prostate cancer has not been extensively studied. Herein we examine the effects of AICAR on the cell growth and metastasis of prostate cancer cells. Cell growth was performed by MTT assay and soft agar assay; cell apoptosis was examined by Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining and poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage western blot, while cell migration and invasion were evaluated by wound-healing assay and transwell assay respectively. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related protein expression and AMPK/mTOR-dependent signaling axis were analyzed by western blot. In addition, we also tested the effect of AICAR on the chemosensitivity to docetaxel using MTT assay. Our results indicated that AICAR inhibits cell growth in prostate cancer cells, but not in non-cancerous prostate cells. In addition, our results demonstrated that AICAR induces apoptosis, attenuates transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-induced cell migration, invasion and EMT-related protein expression, and enhances the chemosensitivity to docetaxel in prostate cancer cells through regulating the AMPK/mTOR-dependent pathway. These findings support AICAR as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of prostate cancer.",Int J Mol Sci,2019,"['Su CC', 'Hsieh KL', 'Liu PL', 'Yeh HC', 'Huang SP', 'Fang SH', 'Cheng WC', 'Huang KH', 'Chiu FY', 'Lin IL', 'Huang MY', 'Li CY']",
30987013,Concomitant Expression of Prolactin Receptor and TGFβ Receptors in Breast Cancer: Association with Less Aggressive Phenotype and Favorable Patient Outcome.,"The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process is known to play an essential role in tumor progression, metastasis and resistance to therapy. This report evaluated the prognostic value of co-expression of the receptor for prolactin (PRLR), a suppressor of EMT, and the receptors for transforming growth factor β (TGFβRI and TGFβRII), an inducer of EMT, in association with different clinicopathological parameters using TMA of 102 breast cancer patients and publicly available data on breast cancer patients. Interestingly, the results revealed that malignant tissues had significantly lower levels of concomitant protein expression of these receptors in comparison to normal/benign breast tissue. In addition, a higher level of concomitant expression was also observed in less aggressive breast cancer phenotypes, including low grade tumors, luminal breast cancer subtype, and less advanced stages of the disease (lymph node negative and early stages). Moreover, the results also showed that the expression of a gene signature composed of PRLR/TGFβRI/TGFβRII correlates more with differentiated grade I tumors, and identified a subset of patients showing better survival outcomes evident in luminal B and HER-2 enriched molecular subtypes. Together, these results indicate that loss of the co-expression of PRLR, TGFβRI and TGFβRII is indicative of aggressiveness and poor patient survival outcomes in breast cancer.",Int J Mol Sci,2019,"['Hachim IY', 'López-Ozuna VM', 'Hachim MY', 'Lebrun JJ', 'Ali S']",
30983542,GLI inhibitors overcome Erlotinib resistance in human pancreatic cancer cells by modulating E-cadherin.,"Inhibition of hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway, including its end effector GLI1, can reverse epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) which plays an important role in drug resistance of pancreatic cancer cells to Erlotinib (ETB). This study investigated the effect of GLI inhibitors Forskolin (FSK), GANT-61 (GNT), and Arsenic trioxide (ATX) on suppressing the resistance of pancreatic cancer cells to ETB. The effect of GLI inhibitors was evaluated by measuring mRNA expression levels of EMT factors using quantitative RT-PCR. Immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry were used to assess E-cadherin (E-Cad) and GLI1 protein levels. MTT and apoptosis assays were used to evaluate the synergistic effects for the combination treatment of each GLI inhibitor with ETB. Pancreatic cancer cells PANC-1 treated by GNT showed the highest significant reduction in mRNA levels of GLI1 and other EMT pathway genes. Moreover, GNT was able to upregulate E-Cad and downregulate GLI1 proteins, more than FSK, while ATX had no effect. Apoptosis levels of PANC-1 cells following treatment with LD30 concentrations of FSK, GNT, or ATX, showed 57%, 62% and 67%, respectively, in comparison to ETB (∼48%). Importantly, combination treatments of ETB with either FSK, GNT, or ATX demonstrated a significant increase in apoptotic cells reaching 61% (ETB + FSK), 80% (ETB + GNT) or 88% (ETB + ATX). FSK did not have much effect on the drug resistance of PANC-1 cells to ETB. However, GNT, but more effectively ATX, were able to reduce the drug resistance of this cell line to ETB.",J Chemother,2019,"['Ghanbari A', 'Cheraghzadeh Z', 'Mahmoudi R', 'Zibara K', 'Hosseini E']",
30982861,Transcriptional changes in prostate of men on active surveillance after a 12-mo glucoraphanin-rich broccoli intervention-results from the Effect of Sulforaphane on prostate CAncer PrEvention (ESCAPE) randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological evidence suggests that consumption of cruciferous vegetables is associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer progression, largely attributed to the biological activity of glucosinolate degradation products, such as sulforaphane derived from glucoraphanin. Because there are few therapeutic interventions for men on active surveillance for prostate cancer to reduce the risk of cancer progression, dietary approaches are an appealing option for patients.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated whether consumption of a glucoraphanin-rich broccoli soup for 1 y leads to changes in gene expression in prostate tissue of men with localized prostate cancer.
METHODS: Forty-nine men on active surveillance completed a 3-arm parallel randomized double-blinded intervention study for 12 mo and underwent transperineal template biopsy procedures and dietary assessment at the start and end of the study. Patients received a weekly 300 mL portion of soup made from a standard broccoli (control) or from 1 of 2 experimental broccoli genotypes with enhanced concentrations of glucoraphanin, delivering 3 and 7 times that of the control, respectively. Gene expression in tissues from each patient obtained before and after the dietary intervention was quantified by RNA sequencing followed by gene set enrichment analyses.
RESULTS: In the control arm, there were several hundred changes in gene expression in nonneoplastic tissue during the 12 mo. These were associated with an increase in expression of potentially oncogenic pathways including inflammation processes and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Changes in gene expression and associated oncogenic pathways were attenuated in men on the glucoraphanin-rich broccoli soup in a dose-dependent manner. Although the study was not powered to assess clinical progression, an inverse association between consumption of cruciferous vegetables and cancer progression was observed.
CONCLUSION: Consuming glucoraphanin-rich broccoli soup affected gene expression in the prostate of men on active surveillance, consistent with a reduction in the risk of cancer progression.

30981837,LncRNA SNHG15 acts as an oncogene in prostate cancer by regulating miR-338-3p/FKBP1A axis.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are crucial regulators in the progression of various diseases. Although the role of lncRNAs in prostate cancer (PCa) has been studied in recent years, there are still numerous lncRNAs need to be elucidated. This study aims to detect the role of lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 15 (SNHG15) in human prostate cancer. Using qRT-PCR analysis, we identified the upregulation of SNHG15 in PCa cell lines. Loss-of function assays were conducted to determine the regulatory effect of SNHG15 on PCa cell proliferation, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). According to the results of functional assays, we found that knockdown of SNHG15 impaired cell viability, suppressed cell proliferation, inhibited cell migration and invasion, reversed EMT progress. All these findings revealed the oncogenic function of SNHG15 in PCa. Mechanism investigation revealed that SNHG15 was located in the cytoplasm of PCa cells and acted as a molecular sponge of microRNA-338-3p (miR-338-3p). Moreover, FKBP prolyl isomerase 1A (FKBP1A) was a target of miR-338-3p. This investigation demonstrated that SNHG15 may serve as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to regulate miR-338-3p and FKBP1A. Finally, the involvement of miR-338-3p and FKBP1A in SNHG15-mediated biological function was demonstrated by performing rescue assays. In summary, our study revealed the function of a novel pathway in PCa.",Gene,2019,"['Zhang Y', 'Zhang D', 'Lv J', 'Wang S', 'Zhang Q']",
30979377,NDR2 kinase contributes to cell invasion and cytokinesis defects induced by the inactivation of RASSF1A tumor-suppressor gene in lung cancer cells.,"BACKGROUND: RASSF1A, a tumor suppressor gene, is frequently inactivated in lung cancer leading to a YAP-dependent epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Such effects are partly due to the inactivation of the anti-migratory RhoB GTPase via the inhibitory phosphorylation of GEF-H1, the GDP/GTP exchange factor for RhoB. However, the kinase responsible for RhoB/GEF-H1 inactivation in RASSF1A-depleted cells remained unknown.
METHODS: NDR1/2 inactivation by siRNA or shRNA effects on epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, xenograft formation and growth in SCID-/- Beige mice, apoptosis, proliferation, cytokinesis, YAP/TAZ activation were investigated upon RASSF1A loss in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC).
RESULTS: We demonstrate here that depletion of the YAP-kinases NDR1/2 reverts migration and metastatic properties upon RASSF1A loss in HBEC. We show that NDR2 interacts directly with GEF-H1 (which contains the NDR phosphorylation consensus motif HXRXXS/T), leading to GEF-H1 phosphorylation. We further report that the RASSF1A/NDR2/GEF-H1/RhoB/YAP axis is involved in proper cytokinesis in human bronchial cells, since chromosome proper segregation are NDR-dependent upon RASSF1A or GEF-H1 loss in HBEC.
CONCLUSION: To summarize, our data support a model in which, upon RASSF1A silencing, NDR2 gets activated, phosphorylates and inactivates GEF-H1, leading to RhoB inactivation. This cascade induced by RASSF1A loss in bronchial cells is responsible for metastasis properties, YAP activation and cytokinesis defects.",J. Exp. Clin.

METHODS: lncRNA expression profiles in matched normal and CRC tissue were checked using microarray analysis. The biological roles of a novel lncRNA, namely RP11-138 J23.1 (RP11), in development of CRC were checked both in vitro and in vivo. Its association with clinical progression of CRC was further analyzed.
RESULTS: RP11 was highly expressed in CRC tissues, and its expression increased with CRC stage in patients. RP11 positively regulated the migration, invasion and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) of CRC cells in vitro and enhanced liver metastasis in vivo. Post-translational upregulation of Zeb1, an EMT-related transcription factor, was essential for RP11-induced cell dissemination. Mechanistically, the RP11/hnRNPA2B1/mRNA complex accelerated the mRNA degradation of two E3 ligases, Siah1 and Fbxo45, and subsequently prevented the proteasomal degradation of Zeb1. m

However, the biological functions of GRIK3 in malignancies are largely unknown because of limited related studies. Here, we primarily reported that the expression of GRIK3 was higher in breast cancer tissues than in adjacent noncancerous tissues. GRIK3 expression was also positively correlated with the prognosis of patients with breast cancer. GRIK3 promoted the proliferation and migration abilities of breast cancer cells and enhanced the growth of orthotopically implanted tumors. Mechanically, GRIK3 influenced a range of signaling pathways and key signal transducers, including two epithelial-mesenchymal transition regulators, SPDEF and CDH1. Heterogenous expression of SPDEF and CDH1 counteracted the migration and invasion abilities, respectively, of breast cancer cells induced by GRIK3. Moreover, overexpression of GRIK3 increased the expression of mesenchymal markers and decreased the expression of epithelial markers, resulting in the translocation of β-catenin into the nucleus and the increased β-catenin transcriptional activity. In conclusion, the present study reported a novel oncogenic role of GRIK3. Meanwhile, GRIK3, as a membrane receptor, may also serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of breast cancer.",Mol.

METHODS: The effect of exosomes isolated from cancer stem cells (CSCs) of CCRCC patients on the progress of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and lung metastasis of CCRCC cells were examined.
RESULTS: CSCs exosomes promoted proliferation of CCRCC cells and accelerated the progress of EMT.

However, the exact role of Src-1 and Twist1 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is uncertain. In this study, we investigated the possible prognostic value and biological effect of Src-1 and Twist1 in NPC. Src-1 and Twist1 expression was detected in a cohort of NPC patients (n = 134) by qRT-PCR. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used comparing overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazard regression model. Biologic effect of Src-1 and Twist1 in NPC cell lines was evaluated by western blot, colony formation assay, soft agar assay, scratch wound healing assay, transwell invasion assay and tumor xenografts growth. We have found that Src-1 and Twist1 were aberrantly upregulated in human NPC tissues, and associated with advanced tumor stage, distant metastasis and unfavorable prognosis. Knockdown of Src-1 or Twist1 in human NPC cell line CNE-1 suppressed colony formation, anchorage-independent growth, cell migration, invasion and tumor xenografts growth, while enforced expression of Src-1 or Twist1 in human NPC cell line HNE-2 promotes anchorage-independent growth, cell migration and invasion. In addition, Src-1 and Twist1 could suppress E-cadherin expression and increase Vimentin expression, thus suggested that Src-1 and Twist1 enhanced the malignant behaviors of NPC cells via inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Our data indicated that Src-1 and Twist1 could be possible prognostic biomarkers and potential therapy targets for patients with NPC.",PLoS ONE,2019,"['Zhou J', 'Zhang J', 'Xu M', 'Ke Z', 'Zhang W', 'Mai J']",
30973698,Immobilized Transforming Growth Factor-Beta 1 in a Stiffness-Tunable Artificial Extracellular Matrix Enhances Mechanotransduction in the Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"Cancer progression is regulated by multiple factors of extracellular matrix (ECM). Understanding how cancer cells integrate multiple signaling pathways to achieve specific behaviors remains a challenge because of the lack of appropriate models to copresent and modulate ECM properties. Here we proposed a strategy to build a thin biomaterial matrix by poly(l-lysine) and hyaluronan as an artificial stiffness-tunable ECM. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) was used as a biochemical cue to present in an immobilized and spatially controlled manner, with a high loading efficiency of 90%. Either soft matrix with immobilized TGF-β1 (i-TGF) or bare stiff matrix could only promote HCC cells to form the epithelial phenotype, whereas stiff matrix with i-TGF was the only condition to induce the mesenchymal phenotype. Further investigation revealed that i-TGF increased the specific TGF-β1 receptor (TβRI) expression to activate PI3K pathway. i-TGF-TβRI interactions also promoted HCC cell adhesion to enlarge contact area for stiffness sensing, resulting in the raising expression of the mechano-sensor (β1 integrin). Mechanotransduction would then be enhanced by the β1 integrin/vinculin/p-FAK pathway, leading to a noble PI3K activation. Using our model, a novel mechanism was discovered to elucidate regulation of cell fates by coupling mechanotransduction and biochemical signaling.",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,2019,"['Tang RZ', 'Gu SS', 'Chen XT', 'He LJ', 'Wang KP', 'Liu XQ']",

The vital role of lncRNAs in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) is attracting increasing attention. In the present study, we identify a key lncRNA regulating TSCC metastasis and investigated the underlying mechanism. Our results indicate that the lncRNA ADAMTS9-AS2 is most significantly upregulated in TSCC tissues from patients with lymph node metastasis and is closely associated with poor prognosis. Furthermore, ADAMTS9-AS2 knockdown in TSCC cells leads to a inhibition of cell migration and invasion and reverses TGF-β1 induced EMT. ADAMTS9-AS2 knockdown also inhibits TSCC cell growth in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we show that ADAMTS9-AS2 is a cytoplasmic lncRNA that shares the miRNA response elements (MREs) of miR-600 with EZH2, which is confirmed by a luciferase reporter assay and AGO2-dependent RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP). In summary, our results demonstrate an explicit oncogenic role of ADAMTS9-AS2 in TSCC tumorigenesis via competition with miR-600, suggesting a new regulatory mechanism of ADAMTS9-AS2 and providing a potential therapeutic target for TSCC patients.",Biomed.

Thus, we investigated the role of MTDH in breast cancer and compared the effect of suppressing MTDH by shRNA using liposome, UTMD, or the combination of these 2 methods. MATERIAL AND METHODS Graphing of survival curves of MTDH was analyzed by bioinformatics. UTMD was conducted using an ultrasonic therapeutic apparatus. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to measure cell viability. Migration and invasion rates were measured by wound healing test and Transwell invasion assay, respectively. The expression of MTDH, E-cadherin, metastasis-associated protein-1 (MTA-1), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and MMP-9 were measured by Western blot and qPCR. RESULTS The prognosis of breast cancer can be decreased by the high expression of MTDH, and elevated expression of MTDH was discovered in MCF-7, MCF-10A, and T47D cell lines. UTMD combined with liposome is most efficient in transfecting shRNA, clearly suppressing the expression of MTDH and thereby decreasing cell viability, migration, invasion rate, and epithelial- mesenchymal transition (EMT) processes in the MCF-7 cell line. CONCLUSIONS UTMD combined with liposome could be used as a more efficient way to transfect shRNA into cells to suppress the expression of MTDH and thus lead to the downregulation of proliferation, migration, and EMT processes of the MCF-7 cell line, showing the potential for use in gene therapy.",Med.

30968155,Netrin‑1 interference potentiates epithelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition through the PI3K/AKT pathway under the hypoxic microenvironment conditions of non‑small cell lung cancer.,"Netrin‑1 is overexpressed in several types of cancer. However, whether netrin‑1 can potentiate hypoxia‑induced tumor progression in lung cancer has not been reported to date. Thus, the objective of the present study was to investigate whether netrin‑1 regulates cancer cell migration and invasion under hypoxic conditions in lung cancer and explore the underlying mechanism. A three‑dimensional microfluidic chip was used to observe real‑time changes in cancer cells, and cobalt chloride (CoCl2) was used to simulate a hypoxic microenvironment. Netrin‑1 siRNA was employed in the A549 and PC9 cell lines to downregulate the expression of netrin‑1. Microfluidic chip, wound healing and Transwell assays were used to examine cell migration and invasion. The expression levels of E‑cadherin and vimentin were detected by western blotting. The data demonstrated that netrin‑1 mediated epithelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) of A549 and PC9 cells in vitro, which may be associated with the phosphoinositide 3 kinase/AKT pathway. This effect of netrin‑1 on the EMT was not observed in the normoxic microenvironment. In this retrospective study, netrin‑1 concentrations were evaluated in serum obtained from patients with non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and compared with healthy control samples by quantitative enzyme‑linked immunosorbent analysis. The serum concentration of netrin‑1 was found to be significantly higher in NSCLC patients compared with that in healthy donors. Taken together, the findings of the present study highlight a novel role for netrin‑1 in tumor development under hypoxia in NSCLC and provide further evidence for the use of netrin‑1 as a therapeutic target.",Int.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether COUP‑TFII regulates colorectal cancer cell (CRC) invasion and migration by inhibiting microRNA (miR)‑34a. Transwell system and wound healing assays were performed to examine cell invasiveness and migration, respectively. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were used to detect the RNA and protein levels of target molecules, respectively. The results revealed that COUP‑TFII knockdown significantly inhibited CRC invasion and migration. In addition, the expression of miR‑34a, a well‑known tumor suppressor was revealed to be inversely correlated with COUP‑TFII expression. The miR‑34a mimic significantly reduced CRC invasion and migration abilities, while the miR‑34a inhibitor enhanced CRC invasion and migration activity. There was no significant difference between the negative small interfering RNA and miR‑34a inhibitor groups following knockdown of COUP‑TFII. Furthermore, western blotting demonstrated that miR‑34a mimics inhibited the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) process of CRCs, while the miR‑34a inhibitor had the opposite effect.

30967542,Competitive endogenous RNA is an intrinsic component of EMT regulatory circuits and modulates EMT.,"The competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis suggests an intrinsic mechanism to regulate biological processes. However, whether the dynamic changes of ceRNAs can modulate miRNA activities remains controversial. Here, we examine the dynamics of ceRNAs during TGF-β-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We observe that TGFBI, a transcript highly induced during EMT in A549 cells, acts as the ceRNA for miR-21 to modulate EMT. We further identify FN1 as the ceRNA for miR-200c in the canonical SNAIL-ZEB-miR200 circuit in MCF10A cells. Experimental assays and computational simulations demonstrate that the dynamically induced ceRNAs are directly coupled with the canonical double negative feedback loops and are critical to the induction of EMT. These results help to establish the relevance of ceRNA in cancer EMT and suggest that ceRNA is an intrinsic component of the EMT regulatory circuit and may represent a potential target to disrupt EMT during tumorigenesis.",Nat Commun,2019,"['Liu Y', 'Xue M', 'Du S', 'Feng W', 'Zhang K', 'Zhang L', 'Liu H', 'Jia G', 'Wu L', 'Hu X', 'Chen L', 'Wang P']",
30965609,High Glucose Concentrations Negatively Regulate the IGF1R/Src/ERK Axis through the MicroRNA-9 in Colorectal Cancer.,"Studies have revealed that people with hyperglycemia have a high risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Hyperglycemia may be responsible for supplying energy to CRC cells. However, the potential molecular mechanism for this association remains unclear. Furthermore, microRNA-9 (miR-9) has a tumor-suppressive function in CRC. Aberrant reduced expression of miR-9 is involved in the development and progression of malignancy caused by a high glucose (HG) concentration. In this study, we used an HG concentration to activate miR-9 downregulation in CRC cells. Our results indicated that miR-9 decreased the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R)/Src signaling pathway and downstream cyclin B1 and N-cadherin but upregulated E-cadherin. The HG concentration not only promoted cell proliferation, increased the G1 population, and modulated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) protein expression and morphology but also promoted the cell migration and invasion ability of SW480 (low metastatic potential) and SW620 (high metastatic potential) cells. In addition, low glucose concentrations could reverse the effect of the HG concentration in SW480 and SW620 cells. In conclusion, our results provide new evidence for multiple signaling pathways being regulated through hyperglycemia in CRC. We propose that blood sugar control may serve as a potential strategy for the clinical management of CRC.",Cells,2019,"['Chen YC', 'Ou MC', 'Fang CW', 'Lee TH', 'Tzeng SL']",
30961670,Inhibition of ATM reverses EMT and decreases metastatic potential of cisplatin-resistant lung cancer cells through JAK/STAT3/PD-L1 pathway.,"BACKGROUND: The cisplatin-resistance is still a main course for chemotherapy failure of lung cancer patients. Cisplatin-resistant cancer cells own higher malignance and exhibited increased metastatic ability, but the mechanism is not clear. In this study, we investigated the effects of Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) on lung cancer metastasis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cisplatin-resistant A549CisR and H157CisR cell line were generated by long-term treating parental A549 and H157 cells (A549P and H157P) with cisplatin. Cell growth, cell migration and cell invasion were determined. Gene expressions were determined by Western Blot and qPCR. Tumor metastasis was investigated using a xenograft mouse model.
RESULTS: The IC50 of the cisplatin-resistant cells (A549CisR and H157CisR cells) to cisplatin was 6-8 higher than parental cells. The A549CisR and H157CisR cells expressed lower level of E-cadherin and higher levels of N-cadherin, Vimentin and Snail compared to the parental A549P and H157P cells, and exhibited stronger capabilities of metastatic potential compared to the parental cells. The ATM expression was upregulated in A549CisR and H157CisR cells and cisplatin treatment also upregulated expression of ATM in parental cells, The inhibition of ATM by using specific ATM inhibitor CP466722 or knock-down ATM by siRNA suppressed Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastatic potential of A549CisR and H157CisR cells. These data suggest that ATM mediates the cisplatin-resistance in lung cancer cells. Expressions of JAK
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that ATM regulates PD-L1 expression through activation of JAK/STAT3 signaling in cisplatin-resistant cells. Overexpression of ATM contributes to cisplatin-resistance in lung cancer cells. Inhibition of ATM reversed EMT and inhibited cell invasion and tumor metastasis.

The in vitro cell proliferative, migratory and invasive abilities were evaluated by MTS, colony formation and transwell assay, respectively. The role of GTSE1 in the growth and metastasis of breast cancer were revealed by in vivo investigation using BALB/c nude mice.
RESULTS: We showed that the expression level of GTSE1 was upregulated in breast cancer specimens and cell lines, especially in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and p53 mutated breast cancer cell lines. Importantly, high GTSE1 expression was positively correlated with histological grade and poor survival. We demonstrated that GTSE1 could promote breast cancer cell growth by activating the AKT pathway and enhance metastasis by regulating the Epithelial-Mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. Furthermore, it could cause multidrug resistance in breast cancer cells. Interestingly, we found that GTSE1 could regulate the p53 function to alter the cell cycle distribution dependent on the mutation state of p53.
CONCLUSION: Our results reveal that GTSE1 played a key role in the progression of breast cancer, indicating that GTSE1 could serve as a novel biomarker to aid in the assessment of the prognosis of breast cancer.",J.

30961491,Evaluation of Changes in the Expression Pattern of EDIL3 in Different Grades of Endometrial Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: EDIL3 is an extracellular matrix protein that plays a key role in angiogenesis. Changes in the pattern of its expression also affect cellular processes and the tumor microenvironment. Elevated level of EDIL3 is considered an unfavorable prognostic marker of survival.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in EDIL3 expression in endometrial cancer at various degrees of its differentiation (G1-G3) and to discuss its potential role as a molecular diagnostic marker and therapeutic target.
METHODS: The study group consisted of 45 patients with endometrial cancer: G1, 17; G2, 15; G3, 13. The control group (C) included 15 patients without neoplastic changes. The expression of EDIL3 was assessed using immunohistochemistry. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistica 12 PL software (p<0.05).
RESULTS: Analysis of EDIL3 expression showed that the average optical density of the reaction product in G1 reached 130% of the control, while the values in G2 and G3 were 153% and 158%, respectively. Regardless of the endometrial cancer grade, an increase in EDIL3 level was observed compared to the control.
CONCLUSION: In our study, we demonstrated overexpression of EDIL3 protein in endometrial cancer.

In this study, we investigated the role of CAFs in endometrial cancer (EC) cells. We found that the pituitary tumor transforming gene (PTTG) expression was significantly increased in EC cell lines compared to normal human endometrial epithelial cells. Furthermore, CAFs could induce PTTG over-expression and increase EC cell invasion and migration in vitro. In addition, CAFs also induced EMT in EC cells.

30959975,The Role of Fibrosis and Liver-Associated Fibroblasts in the Pathogenesis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most aggressive types of cancer and lacks effective therapeutic approaches. Most HCC develops in the setting of chronic liver injury, hepatic inflammation, and fibrosis. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key players in liver fibrogenesis and hepatocarcinogenesis, respectively. CAFs, which probably derive from HSCs, activate into extracellular matrix (ECM)-producing myofibroblasts and crosstalk with cancer cells to affect tumor growth and invasion. In this review, we describe the different components which form the HCC premalignant microenvironment (PME) and the tumor microenvironment (TME), focusing on the liver fibrosis process and the biology of CAFs. We will describe the CAF-dependent mechanisms which have been suggested to promote hepatocarcinogenesis, such as the alteration of ECM, CAF-dependent production of cytokines and angiogenic factors, CAF-dependent reduction of immuno-surveillance, and CAF-dependent promotion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). New knowledge of the fibrosis process and the role of CAFs in HCC may pave the way for new therapeutic strategies for liver cancer.",Int J Mol Sci,2019,"['Baglieri J', 'Brenner DA', 'Kisseleva T']",
30958537,Grainyhead-like Protein 2: The Emerging Role in Hormone-Dependent Cancers and Epigenetics.,"In mammals, the grainyhead-like transcription factor (GRHL) family is composed of three nuclear proteins that are responsible for driving epithelial cell fate: GRHL1, GRHL2, and GRHL3. GRHL2 is important in maintaining proper tubulogenesis during development and in suppressing the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Within the last decade, evidence indicates both tumor-suppressive and oncogenic roles for GRHL2 in various types of cancers. Recent studies suggest that GRHL2 may be especially important in hormone-dependent cancers, as correlative relationships exist between GRHL2 and various steroid receptors, such as the androgen and estrogen receptors. Acting as a pioneer factor and coactivator, GRHL2 may directly affect steroid receptor transcriptional activity. This review will highlight recent discoveries of GRHL2 activity in cancer and in maintaining the epithelial state, while also exploring recent literature on the role of GRHL2 in hormone-dependent cancers and epigenetics.",Endocrinology,2019,"['Reese RM', 'Harrison MM', 'Alarid ET']",

To date, the role of ZEB2 in human laryngeal carcinoma has not been clearly defined. In the present study, the level of ZEB2 expression in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) tissues and adjacent normal tissues was evaluated using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The effects of ZEB2 on the growth, migration, invasion, cell cycle distribution and apoptosis of laryngeal cancer cells were also explored using MTT, Transwell and flow cytometry assays. It was identified that ZEB2 was upregulated in LSCC tissues compared with normal tissues. Silencing of ZEB2 inhibited the viability, migration and invasion of LSCC cells. It was also observed that ZEB2 silencing induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in LSCC cells. Furthermore, ZEB2 silencing inhibited the process of epithelial‑mesenchymal transition.

In this study, the expression levels of miR-331-3p in NSCLC tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues were examined by quantitative RT-PCR, and the relationship between miR-331-3p expression and patient clinicopathological characteristics was analyzed. The effects of miR-331-3p on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration, and metastasis of NSCLC cells were determined in vitro and vivo. Direct functional targets of miR-331-3p were identified by luciferase reporter assay, western blot assay, immunohistochemical staining, and rescue assay. The downstream pathway regulated by miR-331-3p was identified by immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, and Rac1 activity examination. Our results showed that miR-331-3p was significantly downregulated in NSCLC tumor tissues and was correlated with clinicopathological characteristics, and miR-331-3p could be an independent prognostic marker for NSCLC patients. Furthermore, miR-331-3p significantly suppressed EMT, migration and metastasis of NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo. Both ErbB2 and VAV2 were direct functional targets of miR-331-3p. The activities of Rac1, PAK1, and β-catenin were regulated by miR-331-3p through ErbB2 and VAV2 targeting.

30954569,Getting a grip on adhesion: Cadherin switching and collagen signaling.,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a developmental biological process that is hijacked during tumor progression. Cadherin switching, which disrupts adherens junctions and alters cadherin-associated signaling pathways, is common during EMT. In many tumors, substantial extracellular matrix (ECM) is deposited. Collagen is the most abundant ECM constituent and it mediates specific signaling pathways by binding to integrins and discoidin domain receptors (DDRs). The interaction of the collagen receptors results in activation of signaling pathways that promote tumor progression including an induction of the cadherin switching. DDR inhibitors have demonstrated anticancer therapeutic efficacy preclinically by inhibiting the collagen signaling. Understanding how collagen signaling impacts cellular processes including EMT and cadherin switching is of great interest especially given the strong interest in stromal targeted therapies for desmoplastic cancers.",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Res,2019,"['Huang H', 'Wright S', 'Zhang J', 'Brekken RA']",

Under physiological conditions, DDR1 is predominantly expressed in epithelial cells and functions to maintain cell differentiation and tissue homeostasis. A switch in expression from DDR1 to DDR2 occurs during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. However, opposite effects of DDR1 are reported to be involved in the progression of cancer and fibrotic diseases. Accumulating evidence suggests that DDR1 is involved in pro-metastasis and pro-survival signals. This review summarizes the roles of DDR1 in epithelial cell differentiation, cell migration, cancer progression and tissues fibrosis and highlights how the dichotomous functions of DDR1 may relevant to different cell types and statues.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study examined the antitumor effect of ganetespib in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and experimentally established EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistant cells harboring various resistance mechanisms, including EGFR T790M mutation, met proto-oncogene amplification, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.
RESULTS: Ganetespib showed a potent antitumor effect at low concentrations, suppressing EGFR-related downstream pathway molecules and inducing cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase in all examined EGFR-TKI-resistant cell lines in vitro.

30947697,Endothelial cell-derived nidogen-1 inhibits migration of SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells.,"BACKGROUND: The tumour microenvironment is a critical regulator of malignant cancer progression. While endothelial cells have been widely studied in the context of tumour angiogenesis, their role as modulators of cancer cell invasion and migration is poorly understood.
METHODS: We have investigated the influence of endothelial cells on the invasive and migratory behaviour of human cancer cells in vitro.
RESULTS: Upon exposure to culture supernatants of endothelial cells, distinct cancer cells, such as SK-BR-3 cells, showed significantly increased invasion and cell migration concomitant with changes in cell morphology and gene expression reminiscent of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Interestingly, the pro-migratory effect on SK-BR-3 cells was significantly enhanced by supernatants obtained from subconfluent, proliferative endothelial cells rather than from confluent, quiescent endothelial cells. Systematically comparing the supernatants of subconfluent and confluent endothelial cells by quantitative MS proteomics revealed eight candidate proteins that were secreted at significantly higher levels by confluent endothelial cells representing potential inhibitors of cancer cell migration. Among these proteins, nidogen-1 was exclusively expressed in confluent endothelial cells and was found to be necessary and sufficient for the inhibition of SK-BR-3 cell migration. Indeed, SK-BR-3 cells exposed to nidogen-1-depleted endothelial supernatants showed increased promigratory STAT3 phosphorylation along with increased cell migration. This reflects the situation of enhanced SK-BR-3 migration upon stimulation with conditioned medium from subconfluent endothelial cells with inherent absence of nidogen-1 expression.
CONCLUSION: The identification of nidogen-1 as an endothelial-derived inhibitor of migration of distinct cancer cell types reveals a novel mechanism of endothelial control over cancer progression.",BMC Cancer,2019,"['Ferraro DA', 'Patella F', 'Zanivan S', 'Donato C', 'Aceto N', 'Giannotta M', 'Dejana E', 'Diepenbruck M', 'Christofori G', 'Buess M']",
30947633,ENKUR Is Involved in the Regulation of Cellular Biology in Colorectal Cancer Cells via PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathway.,"Colorectal cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide. ENKUR is a transient receptor potential canonical-binding protein that acts as a potential regulator or effector of transient receptor potential canonical channels. It also directly interacts with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase. However, the role of ENKUR in colorectal cancer remains unclear. In the present study, the expression profiles of ENKUR in the The Cancer Genome Atlas and ONCOMINE databases were analyzed. Significant downregulation of ENKUR was observed in clinical tumor samples of various cancer types, including colorectal cancer. Decreased ENKUR messenger RNA expression and ENKUR protein level were detected in 6 human colorectal cancer cell lines. Silencing of ENKUR in colorectal cancer cells led to enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while the opposite effects were achieved in ENKUR-overexpressing cells. Furthermore, ENKUR-underexpressing cells exhibited increased activity of phosphoinositide 3-kinase /Akt signaling pathway. Downregulation of the epithelial marker, E-cadherin, and upregulation of the mesenchymal markers, vimentin and N-cadherin, were detected in ENKUR-underexpressing cells, suggesting the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that ENKUR may be responsible for alterations in the proliferative, migratory, and invasive potential of colorectal cancer cells through possible involvement in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase /Akt signaling pathway.",Technol.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Firstly, wound healing, transwell invasion, immunofluorescence and tube formation assays were performed to measure the effect of hypoxia on migration, invasion, EMT and VM of SACC cells, respectively. Then, immunofluorescence and RT-PCR were used to detect the effect of hypoxia on VE-cadherin and VEGFA expression. And pro-vasculogenic mimicry effect of VEGFA was investigated by confocal laser scanning microscopy and Western blot. Moreover, the levels of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin, CD44 and ALDH1 were determined by Western blot and immunofluorescence in SACC cells treated by exogenous VEGFA or bevacizumab. Finally, CD31/ PAS staining was performed to observe VM and immunohistochemistry was used to determine the levels of VEGFA and HIF-1α in 95 SACC patients. The relationships between VM and clinicopathological variables, VEGFA or HIF-1α level were analysed.
RESULTS: Hypoxia promoted cell migration, invasion, EMT and VM formation, and enhanced VE-cadherin and VEGFA expression in SACC cells. Further, exogenous VEGFA markedly increased the levels of N-cadherin, Vimentin, CD44 and ALDH1, and inhibited the expression of E-cadherin, while the VEGFA inhibitor reversed these changes. In addition, VM channels existed in 25 of 95 SACC samples, and there was a strong positive correlation between VM and clinic stage, distant metastases, VEGFA and HIF-1α expression.

30943218,Lipidomic and transcriptomic analysis of western diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in female Ldlr -/- mice.,"BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide, particularly in obese and type 2 diabetic individuals. NAFLD ranges in severity from benign steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); and NASH can progress to cirrhosis, primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver failure. As such, NAFLD has emerged as a major public health concern. Herein, we used a lipidomic and transcriptomic approach to identify lipid markers associated with western diet (WD) induced NASH in female mice.
METHODS: Female mice (low-density lipoprotein receptor null (Ldlr -/-) were fed a reference or WD diet for 38 and 46 weeks. Transcriptomic and lipidomic approaches, coupled with statistical analyses, were used to identify associations between major NASH markers and transcriptomic & lipidomic markers.
RESULTS: The WD induced all major hallmarks of NASH in female Ldlr -/- mice, including steatosis (SFA, MUFA, MUFA-containing di- and triacylglycerols), inflammation (TNFα), oxidative stress (Ncf2), and fibrosis (Col1A). The WD also increased transcripts associated with membrane remodeling (LpCat), apoptosis & autophagy (Casp1, CtsS), hedgehog (Taz) & notch signaling (Hey1), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (S1004A) and cancer (Gpc3). WD feeding, however, suppressed the expression of the hedgehog inhibitory protein (Hhip), and enzymes involved in triglyceride catabolism (Tgh/Ces3, Ces1g), as well as the hepatic abundance of C18-22 PUFA-containing phosphoglycerolipids (GpCho, GpEtn, GpSer, GpIns). WD feeding also increased hepatic cyclooxygenase (Cox1 & 2) expression and pro-inflammatory ω6 PUFA-derived oxylipins (PGE2), as well as lipid markers of oxidative stress (8-iso-PGF2α). The WD suppressed the hepatic abundance of reparative oxylipins (19, 20-DiHDPA) as well as the expression of enzymes involved in fatty epoxide metabolism (Cyp2C, Ephx).
CONCLUSION: WD-induced NASH in female Ldlr -/- mice was characterized by a massive increase in hepatic neutral and membrane lipids containing SFA and MUFA and a loss of C18-22 PUFA-containing membrane lipids. Moreover, the WD increased hepatic pro-inflammatory oxylipins and suppressed the hepatic abundance of reparative oxylipins.

The present study investigated the possible association of FOXM1 expression in patients with OSCC with their clinicopathological characteristics and clinical outcomes. The expression of FOXM1 protein in OSCC tissues from 119 patients was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, and the results demonstrated that FOXM1 overexpression in patients with OSCC was associated with tumour recurrence and poor prognosis. To study the in vitro effects of FOXM1, its expression was decreased by small interfering RNA (siRNA) in OSCC cell lines, and FOXM1 knockdown decreased the proliferative, migratory and invasive capacities of cells.

While many multifaceted nodules converge onto the EMT program, in this review we will highlight the fundamental biology of the signaling schemas that enable EMT. In many cancers, the property of tumor dissemination and metastasis is closely associated with re-enabling developmental properties such as EMT. We discuss the molecular complexity of the tumor heterogeneity in terms of EMT-based gene expression molecular subtypes, and the rewiring of critical signaling nodules in the subtypes displaying higher degrees of EMT can be therapeutically exploited. Specifically in the context of a deadly malignancy such as ovarian cancer where there are no defined mutations or limited biomarkers for developing targeted therapy or personalized medicine, we highlight the importance of identifying EMT-based subtypes that will improve therapeutic intervention. In ovarian cancer, the poor prognosis mesenchymal 'Mes' subtype presents with amplified signaling of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL, extensive crosstalk with other RTKs such as cMET, EGFR and HER2, and sustained temporal activation of extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) leading to induction of EMT transcription factor Slug, underscoring a pathway addiction in Mes that can be therapeutically targeted. We will further examine the emergence of therapeutic modalities in these EMT subtypes and finally conclude with potential interdisciplinary biophysical methodologies to provide additional insights in deciphering the mechanistic and biochemical aspects of EMT. This review intends to provide an overview of the cellular and molecular changes accompanying epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in development and the requisition of this evolutionarily conserved pathway in cancer progression and metastatic disease. Specifically, in a heterogeneous disease such as ovarian cancer lacking defined targetable mutations, the identification of EMT-based subtypes has opened avenues to tailor precision personalized medicine.

30930249,TLR4 blockade using TAK-242 suppresses ovarian and breast cancer cells invasion through the inhibition of extracellular matrix degradation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.,"Numerous links exist between inflammation and tumor development. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression by tumor cells can be a contributing factor that promotes tumor cell proliferation, survival, migration, and metastasis. In this study, we explored the impact of TLR4 inhibition using TAK-242, a specific inhibitor of TLR4, on the invasion properties of ovarian (A2780CP, 2008C13, SKOV3, and A2780S) and breast (MCF7, SKBR3, MDA-MB-231, and BT-474) cancer cell lines. Six out of eight cell lines expressed TLR4 and its downstream mediators (MyD88, NF-ĸB1, and RELB), indicating that these cell lines could be proper candidates for the TLR4 inhibition. TAK-242 induced a cytotoxic effect on all tested cell lines; however, a different cell sensitivity pattern was noticeable. Interestingly, in the TLR4-expressing cell lines, there was a significant correlation between the TLR4/MyD88 expressions and the cancer cell response to TAK-242: the higher the expression, the higher the IC",Eur.

FUT3-fucosylated glycoconjugates play key roles in pathways involved in tumor biology and metastasis, such as cellular ligation to E-selectins, TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition, NK cell-mediated tumor cytotoxicity and apoptosis. Tumor-associated FUT3 promoter polymorphism rs2306969 (-6951 C> T, position related to the gene's translation start site) has been linked to breast, ovarian and intestinal gastric cancer. Although non-coding polymorphisms accounts for the majority of variations founded in breast cancer, their functional roles are still poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the impact of different alleles for this variation in FUT3 expression of invasive breast tumors. A luciferase reporter assay was performed using two breast tumor cell lines to evaluate respectively the impact of FUT3 rs2306969 (-6951 CC) and (-6951 TT) on protein expression. Gene and protein expressions were also measured in twenty-nine fresh biopsies of invasive breast tumors. Rs2306969 did not significantly influence FUT3 expression in both used systems. However, this study is defiant since the biological role of this polymorphism in breast cancer and other tumor types could be linked to cis/trans modulation of other genes, respond to different environmental stimuli or impact gene expression only in association with other variations. Rs2306969 did not modulate FUT3 expression in breast tumors under non-stimulated conditions. Nevertheless, our study contributes to the notably challenging task that is to understand how non-coding polymorphisms can drive the overall risk in cancer development.",Mol. Biol.

30928631,Ginsenoside Rg3 inhibits growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of human oral squamous carcinoma cells by down-regulating miR-221.,"Ginsenoside Rg3, isolated from the roots of Panax ginseng, has been found to exert anti-cancer activity on multiple human cancers. However, there is no any literature available about the effect of Rg3 on oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). This study investigated the possible anti-cancer effects of Rg3 on OSCC, as well as the possible molecular mechanisms. In vitro, cell viability and proliferation were respectively detected by CCK-8 assay and BrdU assay. Cell apoptosis was detected by Annexin V-FITC/PI assay. Cell transfection was used to change the expression of miR-221 and TIMP3. qRT-PCR and western blotting were performed to measure the expression of molecules involving in cell apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, PI3K/AKT pathway and MAPK/ERK pathway. In vivo, OSCC orthotopic murine model was established and tumor volumes were measured. We found that Rg3 treatment inhibited viability, proliferation and EMT process of human OSCC SCC-9 and HSC-5 cells, but promoted cell apoptosis. miR-221 was highly expressed in OSCC tissues and cells. Rg3 reduced the expression of miR-221 in OSCC cells. Up-regulation of miR-221 abrogated the effects of Rg3 on SCC-9 and HSC-5 cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis and EMT process. TIMP3 was lowly expressed in OSCC tissues and cells, which was a direct target gene of miR-221. Rg3 inactivated PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways in SCC-9 cells by up-regulating TIMP3. In vivo, Rg3 reduced the tumor volume of OSCC orthotopic murine model. In conclusion, Rg3 exerted anti-cancer effects on OSCC might be via down-regulating miR-221, up-regulating TIMP3, and then inactivating PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways.",Eur. J.

30928404,KRT17 confers paclitaxel-induced resistance and migration to cervical cancer cells.,"AIM: To understand potential pro-oncological effects of lower dose paclitaxel treatment in cervical cancer cells, we investigated the potential roles of KRT17 on migration and proliferation of cervical cancer cells which might respond to cytoskeletal-based drugs treatments.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We extracted the clinic data of cervical cancer patients from TCGA database to investigate mRNA expression of different keratins. HPV genotypes were identified by reverse transcription PCR. krt17 mRNA and EMT markers were quantified by real-time PCR. krt17 and EMT markers protein were immunoblotted by western blot. Cell viability was detected by CCK8. Cell migration was performed by transwell migration assay.
KEY FINDINGS: Our results showed that HPV16 infection correlated with the expression of KRT17 in cervical cancer cell lines. KRT17 knockdown would decrease Snail2 and elevate E-Cadherin to inhibit migration of Caski cells and SiHa cells. Lower dose of paclitaxel promoted SiHa proliferation, it also significantly promoted the migration of Caski cells. Otherwise, colchicine and higher dose of paclitaxel dose-dependently suppressed the proliferation and migration of Caski cells and SiHa cells. Moreover, KRT17 knockdown significantly facilitated cytoskeletal-based drugs to inhibit migration and induce cytotoxicity in cervical cancer cells.
SIGNIFICANCE: KRT17 played pivotal oncogenic roles in cell survival, migration and paclitaxel-induced resistance of cervical cancer cells. Thus, KRT17 would serve as a promising target for compromising paclitaxel-induced resistance and metastasis.",Life Sci.,2019,"['Li J', 'Chen Q', 'Deng Z', 'Chen X', 'Liu H', 'Tao Y', 'Wang X', 'Lin S', 'Liu N']",
30928020,Platelets promote invasion and induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition in ovarian cancer cells by TGF-β signaling pathway.,"OBJECTIVE: To test whether platelets could increase invasion potential and initiate EMT in ovarian cancer cells via a TGF-β signaling pathway.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected in 69 patients with ovarian cancer, 16 patients with benign ovarian tumor and 64 healthy donors. SK-OV-3 and OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cells were treated with platelets. Transwell assays were used to analyze the invasive capacity, and EMT was assessed by microarray analysis, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and Western blotting. Activation of TGF-β pathway was examined by ELISA and Western blotting. TGF-β type I receptor (TβR I) inhibitor A83-01 was used to confirm the role of TGF-β pathway in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: Clinical data showed ovarian cancer patients with elevated platelet counts had a higher incidence of advanced stages. Treatment with platelets increased the invasive properties of both cell lines. Mesenchymal markers (snail family transcriptional repressor-1, vimentin, neural cadherin, fibronectin-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-2) were up-regulated in platelet-treated cells, while the epithelial marker (epithelial cadherin) was down-regulated. Higher TGF-β level was observed in patients with elevated platelet counts when compared to the subjects. Higher levels of TGF-β were also found in culture medium treated with platelets, and cells treated with platelets also showed increased phosphorylation of Smad2. TβR I inhibitor A83-01 reversed the EMT-like alterations and inhibited platelet-induced invasion in vitro and in vivo.
CONCLUSION: Platelet increased invasion potential and induced EMT in ovarian cancer cells in a TGF-β dependent pathway. Platelet-derived TGF-β may be useful as a new target treatment for ovarian cancer.",Gynecol. Oncol.,2019,"['Guo Y', 'Cui W', 'Pei Y', 'Xu D']",
30927925,Crosstalk between cancer cells and tumor associated macrophages is required for mesenchymal circulating tumor cell-mediated colorectal cancer metastasis.,"BACKGROUND: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are major components of tumor microenvironment that frequently associated with tumor metastasis in human cancers. Circulating tumor cell (CTC), originating from primary tumor sites, is considered to be the precursors of tumor metastasis. However, the regulatory mechanism of TAMs in CTC-mediated tumor metastasis still remains unclear.
METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the macrophages infiltration (CD68 and CD163), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (E-cadherin and Vimentin) expression in serial sections of human colorectal cancer (CRC) specimens. Then, the correlations between macrophages infiltration and clinicopathologic features, mesenchymal CTC ratio, and patients' prognosis were analyzed. A co-culture assay in vitro was used to evaluate the role of TAMs on CRC EMT, migration and invasion, and ELISA, luciferase reporter assay and CHIP were performed to uncover the underlying mechanism. Furthermore, an in vivo model was carried out to confirm the effect of TAMs on mesenchymal CTC-mediated metastasis.
RESULTS: Clinically, CD163
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicates that TAMs induce EMT program to enhance CRC migration, invasion, and CTC-mediated metastasis by regulating the JAK2/STAT3/miR-506-3p/FoxQ1 axis, which in turn leads to the production of CCL2 that promote macrophage recruitment, revealing a new cross-talk between immune cells and tumor cells in CRC microenvironment.",Mol.

These crucial parts of the surrounding stroma can function as both positive and negative regulators of all hallmarks of cancer development, including evasion of apoptosis, induction of angiogenesis, deregulation of the energy metabolism, resistance to the immune detection and destruction, and activation of invasion and metastasis. This review represents a summary of recent studies focusing on describing these effects of microenvironment on initiation and progression of the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, focusing on oral squamous cell carcinoma, since it is becoming clear that an investigation of differences in stromal composition of the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma microenvironment and their impact on cancer development and progression may help better understand the mechanisms behind different responses to therapy and help define possible targets for clinical intervention.",Mol.

30927908,Cancer-associated fibroblasts as abettors of tumor progression at the crossroads of EMT and therapy resistance.,"In the last decades, the role of the microenvironment in tumor progression and therapeutic outcome has gained increasing attention. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have emerged as key players among stromal cells, owing to their abundance in most solid tumors and their diverse tumor-restraining/promoting roles. The interplay between tumor cells and neighboring CAFs takes place by both paracrine signals (cytokines, exosomes and metabolites) or by the multifaceted functions of the surrounding extracellular matrix. Here, we dissect the most recent identified mechanisms underlying CAF-mediated control of tumor progression and therapy resistance, which include induction of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), activation of survival pathways or stemness-related programs and metabolic reprogramming in tumor cells. Importantly, the recently unveiled heterogeneity in CAFs claims tailored therapeutic efforts aimed at eradicating the specific subset facilitating tumor progression, therapy resistance and relapse. However, despite the large amount of pre-clinical data, much effort is still needed to translate CAF-directed anti-cancer strategies from the bench to the clinic.",Mol.

This study intends to explore the effect of tankyrase1 (TANK1) in the development of osteosarcoma cells and the underlying mechanism. The osteosarcoma cell line MG-63 cells were cultured and transfected with tankyrase1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (TANK1-ASODN). Cell proliferation was detected with CCK-8 and immunofluorescence. Cell migration and invasion were examined by wound healing assay and Transwell assay, respectively. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect the mRNA level of TANK1 and western blot was conducted to detect relative protein expression during the research. As a result, we demonstrated that TANK1 was upregulated in osteosarcoma. The TANK1-ASODN inhibited MG-63 cell proliferation, migration and invasion. The progress of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was also suppressed in TANK1-ASODN transfected MG-63 cells compared to control group. Besides, the TANK1-ASODN activated and modulated the Hippo/YAP signaling which might be the pathway that TANK1 depended on. Overall, our finding supported that TANK1-ASODN slowed down the progress of osteosarcoma by suppressing cell proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT through Hippo/YAP pathway.",Pathol. Res.

30923946,ALDH1 expression correlates with an epithelial-like phenotype and favorable prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma: a study based on immunohistochemistry and mRNA expression data.,"PURPOSE: Cancer stem cells (CSC) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathways are crucial for cancer progression. However, synergistic interactions between CSC and EMT are not clear in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The objective of this study was to investigate CSC markers such as CD44, NANOG, and ALDH1 expression and its correlation with EMT markers in NSCLC patients. Its association with survival was also determined.
METHODS: CD44, NANOG, and ALDH1 protein expression was evaluated in 267 resected NSCLC and its correlation with e-cadherin, β-catenin, p120 catenin, vimentin, SNAIL, and TWIST expressions was determined based on immunohistochemical and mRNA expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Survival analyses also were performed based on immunohistochemistry and mRNA expression data from Gene Expression Omnibus dataset.
RESULTS: ALDH1 expression in lung adenocarcinoma was positively correlated with the epithelial-like phenotype, low vimentin and low TWIST in immunohistochemical and mRNA expression data. NANOG and ALDH1 expressions measured by immunohistochemical and mRNA expression profiling data of adenocarcinomas were associated with a favorable prognosis. ALDH1 was an independent favorable prognostic marker for overall survival or recurrence-free survival in adenocarcinoma (P = 0.026 and P = 0.033, respectively). The epithelial-like phenotype expressing P120-catenin and beta-catenin was associated with a favorable prognosis; however, the TWIST-expressing mesenchymal-like phenotype was correlated with an unfavorable prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: NANOG and ALDH1 protein or mRNA expression showed improved prognosis in adenocarcinoma alone. ALDH1 expression correlated with an epithelial-like phenotype.",J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol.,2019,"['Koh YW', 'Han JH', 'Haam S', 'Jung J']",
30923315,Atypical plant homeodomain of UBR7 functions as an H2BK120Ub ligase and breast tumor suppressor.,"The roles of Plant Homeodomain (PHD) fingers in catalysis of histone modifications are unknown. We demonstrated that the PHD finger of Ubiquitin Protein Ligase E3 Component N-Recognin7 (UBR7) harbors E3 ubiquitin ligase activity toward monoubiquitination of histone H2B at lysine120 (H2BK120Ub). Purified PHD finger or full-length UBR7 monoubiquitinated H2BK120 in vitro, and loss of UBR7 drastically reduced H2BK120Ub genome-wide binding sites in MCF10A cells. Low UBR7 expression was correlated with occurrence of triple-negative breast cancer and metastatic tumors. Consistently, UBR7 knockdown enhanced the invasiveness, induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and promoted metastasis. Conversely, ectopic expression of UBR7 restored these cellular phenotypes and reduced tumor growth. Mechanistically, UBR7 loss reduced H2BK120Ub levels on cell adhesion genes, including CDH4, and upregulated the Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway. CDH4 overexpression could partially revert UBR7-dependent cellular phenotypes. Collectively, our results established UBR7 as a histone H2B monoubiquitin ligase that suppresses tumorigenesis and metastasis of triple-negative breast cancer.",Nat Commun,2019,"['Adhikary S', 'Chakravarti D', 'Terranova C', 'Sengupta I', 'Maitituoheti M', 'Dasgupta A', 'Srivastava DK', 'Ma J', 'Raman AT', 'Tarco E', 'Sahin AA', 'Bassett R', 'Yang F', 'Tapia C', 'Roy S', 'Rai K', 'Das C']",
30922391,Nuciferine inhibits the progression of glioblastoma by suppressing the SOX2-AKT/STAT3-Slug signaling pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Nuciferine (NF), extracted from the leaves of N. nucifera Gaertn, has been shown to exhibit anti-tumor and anti-viral pharmacological properties. It can also penetrate the blood brain barrier (BBB). However, the mechanism by which NF inhibits glioblastoma (GBM) progression is not well understood. We aimed to determine the anti-tumor effect of NF on GBM cell lines and clarify the potential molecular mechanism involved.
METHODS: U87MG and U251 cell lines were used in vitro to assess the anti-tumor efficacy of NF. Cytotoxicity, viability, and proliferation were evaluated by MTT and colony formation assay. After Annexin V-FITC and PI staining, flow cytometry was performed to evaluate apoptosis and cell cycle changes in NF-treated GBM cells. Wound healing and Transwell assays were used to assess migration and invasion of GBM cells. Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence staining, immunohistochemistry, and bioinformatics were used to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms. Preclinical therapeutic efficacy was mainly estimated by ultrasound and MRI in xenograft nude mouse models.
RESULTS: NF inhibited the proliferation, mobility, stemness, angiogenesis, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of GBM cells. Additionally, NF induced apoptosis and G2 cell cycle arrest. Slug expression was also decreased by NF via the AKT and STAT3 signaling pathways. Interestingly, we discovered that NF affected GBM cells partly by targeting SOX2, which may be upstream of the AKT and STAT3 pathways. Finally, NF led to significant tumor control in GBM xenograft models.
CONCLUSIONS: NF inhibited the progression of GBM via the SOX2-AKT/STAT3-Slug signaling pathway. SOX2-targeting with NF may offer a novel therapeutic approach for GBM treatment.",J. Exp. Clin.

30919528,Lysyl oxidase induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition and predicts intrahepatic metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has high recurrence rates even after curative hepatectomy. Drug therapy for recurrence of HCC is still limited; therefore, identifying new therapeutic targets is urgently needed. We searched for genes that would predict HCC recurrence from intrahepatic metastasis in an exhaustive DNA microarray database by searching genes associated with high early recurrence rate and having higher expression in the tumor area compared to background liver. We detected lysyl oxidase (LOX) and validated the clinical significance of LOX in 358 patients who underwent hepatectomy. Expression of LOX was evaluated by qRT- PCR, and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. High LOX expression group had a significantly higher recurrence rate than the low LOX expression group (2-year recurrence rate was 64.0% vs 24.2%, P < .0001 for IHC) and poorer survival rate (5-year rate was 60.1% vs 86.2%, P < .0001 for IHC). Multivariate analysis showed that high LOX expression was an independent risk factor for early recurrence (IHC: HR, 2.52; P < .0001). Bioinformatic analysis showed that LOX expression was associated with hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and the hypoxia cascade, suggesting that HIF-1α or hypoxia regulates LOX expression and induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In vitro, LOX and HIF-1α were involved in migration and invasion capability. High LOX expression is associated with EMT markers and predicts early recurrence and poor survival in patients with HCC. These findings indicate that lysyl oxidase could be a potential therapeutic target for early recurrence of HCC.",Cancer Sci.,2019,"['Umezaki N', 'Nakagawa S', 'Yamashita YI', 'Kitano Y', 'Arima K', 'Miyata T', 'Hiyoshi Y', 'Okabe H', 'Nitta H', 'Hayashi H', 'Imai K', 'Chikamoto A', 'Baba H']",

However, the exact regulation mechanism of miR-574-3p in gastric cancer (GC) progression remains unclear. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the role of miR-574-3p in GC metastasis. We investigated the mechanism via which miR-574-3p regulated cancer cell migration and invasion to determine the relationship between epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and drug resistance. Our results indicated that human GC cell line SGC7901 cells were more sensitive to cisplatin (DDP), but SGC7901 cisplatin-resistant cells (SGC7901/DDP) were more resistant to DDP and had mesenchymal characteristics. In addition, miR-574-3p overexpression up-regulated E-cadherin expression, and concomitantly down-regulated the expression of vimentin. We also identified zinc finger E-box binding homeobox transcription factor 1 (ZEB1), a crucial EMT inducer gene, as a new target of miR-574-3p. In fact, miR-574-3p bound the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of ZEB1, regulating expression of this transcription factor at both the mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, miR-574-3p overexpression reduced the migratory and invasive properties of the SGC7901/DDP cells and inhibited cisplatin (DDP) resistance in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, the results indicated that miR-574-3p inhibited the EMT and enhanced cisplatin sensitivity in GC cells by suppressing ZEB1.

30917533,Induction of the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition of Human Colorectal Cancer by Human TNF-β (Lymphotoxin) and its Reversal by Resveratrol.,"OBJECTIVE: Tumor necrosis factor-beta (TNF-β), as an inflammatory mediator that has been shown to promote tumorigenesis, induces NF-κB. Natural multi-targeted agent resveratrol in turn shows anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) allows cancer cells to turn into a motile state with invasive capacities and is associated with metastasis and development of cancer stem cells (CSC). However, TNF-β-induced EMT and the anti-invasion mechanism of resveratrol on CRC are not yet completely understood.
METHODS: We investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms of resveratrol on TNF-β/TNF-βR-induced EMT and migration of CRC cells (HCT116, RKO, SW480) in monolayer or 3D alginate cultures.
RESULTS: TNF-β, similar to TNF-α, induced significant cell proliferation, morphological change, from an epithelial to a spindle-like mesenchymal shape with the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia associated with the expression of EMT parameters (elevated vimentin and slug, reduced E-cadherin), increased migration/invasion, and formation of CSC in all CRC cells. Interestingly, these effects were dramatically decreased in the presence of resveratrol or anti-TNF-βR with TNF-β co-treatment, inducing biochemical changes to the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), with a planar cell surface and suppressed formation of CSC cells. This was associated with a significant increase in apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that resveratrol suppressed TNF-β-induced NF-κB and NF-κB-regulated gene biomarkers associated with growth, proliferation, and invasion. Finally, TNF-βR interacts directly with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and NF-κB.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that resveratrol down-regulates TNF-β/TNF-βR-induced EMT, at least in part via specific suppression of NF-κΒ and FAK in CRC cells.",Nutrients,2019,"['Buhrmann C', 'Yazdi M', 'Popper B', 'Kunnumakkara AB', 'Aggarwal BB', 'Shakibaei M']",

However, the prognostic significance, underlying mechanisms, and therapeutic value of mu-opioid receptor (MOP) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear.
METHODS: MOP expression in human biopsy HCC samples was evaluated using RNA microarrays, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and immunochemical analyses. Molecular and cellular techniques, including siRNA-mediated depletion and lentiviral vector-mediated overexpression, were used to elucidate the functions and mechanisms of MOP. The effect of the MOP agonist morphine in HCC was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. The therapeutic value of MOP inhibitors in HCC progression and metastasis was investigated with in vitro experiments and subcutaneous and orthotopic HCC mouse models in vivo.
RESULTS: Through microarray analysis and qRT-PCR, we identified that MOP is highly expressed in human HCC tumours. High MOP expression in HCC tumours was confirmed by immunocytochemistry and correlated with aggressive clinicopathological features and a worse prognosis. Depletion of MOP suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, whereas overexpression of MOP promoted cell growth and metastasis in human HCC cell lines. Both clinical and biological evidence revealed that MOP-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition promotes HCC metastasis and poor prognosis. Morphine promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and in vivo in mouse models. More importantly, MOP inhibitors suppressed cell growth, invasion, and metastasis in vitro and in the subcutaneous and orthotopic xenograft models.

Our aim was to explore their roles in both human papillomavirus-positive and -negative oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas. Our cohort comprised 202 consecutive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma patients diagnosed and treated with curative intent. We used tissue microarray tumor blocks to study the immunohistochemical expression of Bmi-1, HESC5:3, and HES77. We compared the expressions of these stem cell markers with p16 immunoexpression and human papillomavirus status, as well as with other characteristics of the tumor, and with patients' clinical data and follow-up data. Human papillomavirus- and p16-positive tumors expressed less Bmi-1 and more HESC5:3 than the negative tumors. HES77 expression was high in human papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, but it did not correlate with p16 positivity. In our multivariable model, Bmi-1 and HESC5:3 were still associated with human papillomavirus, but the association between human papillomavirus and HES77 remained absent. In conclusion, Bmi-1, HESC5:3, and HES77 may have a different role in human papillomavirus-positive and human papillomavirus-negative tumors.

However, the mechanism is not well defined. Here, we aimed to reveal the underlying mechanism of ECM induced metastasis and provide innovative strategy to suppress the distant metastasis induced by ECM.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: IHC was used to detect the expression of target proteins. H&E staining was used to evaluate the growth of tumor in vivo. Using wound healing and transwell assay, we examined the ability of cell to metastasis. We employed IF and Western blot to detect the expression of target proteins. And qRT-PCR was used to examine the target genes in mRNA level. We also applied flow cytometry to examine the percent of CD133
RESULTS: Herein, we observed elevated expression of type I collagen in colorectal cancer tissues from patients with high metastasis. Additionally, colorectal cancer cells cultured on 2D collagen reveal obviously enhanced capability of metastasis and tumorigenesis both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated that the activation of PI3K/AKT signal induced by integrin α2β1 resulted in the enhanced metastatic capability and stemness of colorectal cancer cells. Moreover, we found that Snail worked as the downstream of PI3K/AKT signaling, resulting in the intensive invasion and metastasis of colorectal cancer. Blocking the pathway by applying E7820 successfully reversed the type I collagen induced distant metastasis in colorectal cancer.

METHODS: The effect of MCUR1 expression on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HCC cells was first evaluated by immunofluorescent staining and Western blot. Then, in vitro invasion and in vivo metastasis assays were used to evaluate the function of MCUR1 in HCC metastasis. The underlying mechanism has also been explored by investigating the effect of MCUR1 on ROS/Nrf2/Notch1 pathway.
RESULTS: MCUR1 expression was significantly higher in HCC with metastasis and associated with tumor progression. MCUR1 promoted in vitro invasion and in vivo metastasis of HCC cells by promoting EMT via Snail. Mechanistically, MCUR1-mediated mitochondrial Ca

30909731,Carnosine Suppresses Human Colorectal Cell Migration and Intravasation by Regulating EMT and MMP Expression.,"Carnosine is an endogenous dipeptide found in the vertebrate skeletal muscles that is usually obtained through the diet. To investigate the mechanism by which carnosine regulates the migration and intravasation of human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, we used cultured HCT-116 cells as an experimental model in this study. We examined HCT-116 cell migratory and intravasive abilities and expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated molecules and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) after carnosine treatment. The results showed that both migration and invasion were inhibited in cells treated with carnosine. We found significant decreases in Twist-1 protein levels and increases in E-cadherin protein levels in HCT-116 cells after carnosine exposure. Although plasminogen activator (uPA) and MMP-9 mRNA and protein levels were decreased, TIMP-1 mRNA and protein levels were increased. Furthermore, the cytosolic levels of phosphorylated I ",Am. J.

30909462,Molecular Mechanisms of Pulmonary Fibrogenesis and Its Progression to Lung Cancer: A Review.,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is defined as a specific form of chronic, progressive fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of unknown cause, occurring primarily in older adults, and limited to the lungs. Despite the increasing research interest in the pathogenesis of IPF, unfavorable survival rates remain associated with this condition. Recently, novel therapeutic agents have been shown to control the progression of IPF. However, these drugs do not improve lung function and have not been tested prospectively in patients with IPF and coexisting lung cancer, which is a common comorbidity of IPF. Optimal management of patients with IPF and lung cancer requires understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and molecular pathways that are common to both diseases. This review article reflects the current state of knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis and summarizes the pathways that are common to IPF and lung cancer by focusing on the molecular mechanisms.",Int J Mol Sci,2019,"['Kinoshita T', 'Goto T']",
30909397,C-Met as a Key Factor Responsible for Sustaining Undifferentiated Phenotype and Therapy Resistance in Renal Carcinomas.,"C-Met tyrosine kinase receptor plays an important role under normal and pathological conditions. In tumor cells' overexpression or incorrect activation of c-Met, this leads to stimulation of proliferation, survival and increase of motile activity. This receptor is also described as a marker of cancer initiating cells. The latest research shows that the c-Met receptor has an influence on the development of resistance to targeted cancer treatment. High c-Met expression and activation in renal cell carcinomas is associated with the progression of the disease and poor survival of patients. C-Met receptor has become a therapeutic target in kidney cancer. However, the therapies used so far using c-Met tyrosine kinase inhibitors demonstrate resistance to treatment. On the other hand, the c-Met pathway may act as an alternative target pathway in tumors that are resistant to other therapies. Combination treatment together with c-Met inhibitor reduces tumor growth, vascularization and pro-metastatic behavior and results in suppressed mesenchymal phenotype and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion. Recently, it has been shown that the acquirement of mesenchymal phenotype or lack of cell differentiation might be related to the presence of the c-Met receptor and is consequently responsible for therapy resistance. This review presents the results from recent studies identifying c-Met as an important factor in renal carcinomas being responsible for tumor growth, progression and metastasis, indicating the role of c-Met in resistance to antitumor therapy and demonstrating the pivotal role of c-Met in supporting mesenchymal cell phenotype.",Cells,2019,"['Marona P', 'Górka J', 'Kotlinowski J', 'Majka M', 'Jura J', 'Miekus K']",
30907484,Serum deprivation-response protein regulates aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 through integrin-linked kinase signaling in endometrioid carcinoma cells.,"Endometrioid carcinoma (EC) is one of the most common malignancies of the female genital system. We reported previously that aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1), a predominant isoform of the ALDH family in mammals and a potential marker of normal and malignant stem cells, is related to the tumorigenic potential of EC. We compared the levels of various proteins in human EC cells with high and low ALDH1 expression using shotgun proteomics and found that serum deprivation-response protein (SDPR) was preferentially expressed in cells with high ALDH1 expression. Also known as cavin-2, SDPR is a member of the cavin protein family, which is required for the formation of caveolae. Using SDPR-knockout EC cells generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, we revealed that SDPR was correlated with invasion, migration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and colony formation, as well as the expression of ALDH1. RNA sequencing showed that integrin-linked kinase (ILK) signaling is involved in the effect of SDPR on ALDH1. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the localization of ILK at the cell cortex was disrupted by SDPR knockout, potentially interfering with ILK signaling. Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis of clinical samples showed that SDPR is related to histological characteristics associated with invasiveness, such as poor differentiation, lymphatic invasion, and the microcystic, elongated, and fragmented histopathological pattern. This is, to our knowledge, the first report that SDPR is related to tumor progression.",Cancer Sci.,2019,"['Tahara S', 'Nojima S', 'Ohshima K', 'Hori Y', 'Kurashige M', 'Wada N', 'Motoyama Y', 'Okuzaki D', 'Ikeda JI', 'Morii E']",

These key regulatory functions are facilitated by binding to specific DNA sequences in combination with partner proteins to exert their effects. Recently, overexpression and gene amplification of Sox2 has been associated with tumor aggression and metastasis in various cancer types, including breast, prostate, lung, ovarian and colon cancer. All the different roles for Sox2 involve complicated regulatory networks consisting of protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions. Their involvement in the EMT modulation is possibly enabled by Wnt/ β-catenin and other signaling pathways. There are number of in vivo models which show Sox2 association with increased cancer aggressiveness, resistance to chemo-radiation therapy and decreased survival rate suggesting Sox2 as a therapeutic target. This review will focus on the different roles for Sox2 in metastasis and tumorigenesis. We will also review the mechanism of action underlying the cooperative Sox2- DNA/partner factors binding where Sox2 can be potentially explored for a therapeutic opportunity to treat cancers.",Curr.

30903319,Controlling metastatic cancer: the role of phytochemicals in cell signaling.,"PURPOSE: Cancer is a serious health issue and a leading cause of death worldwide. Most of the cancer patients (approximately 90%) do not die from the consequences of the primary tumor development, but due to a heavily treatable metastatic invasion. During the lengthy multistep process of carcinogenesis, there are a lot of opportunities available to reverse or slow down the tissue invasion or the process of tumor metastasis formation.
RESULTS: Current research has brought many promising results from anti-metastatic experimental studies, and has shown that chemoprevention by natural or semisynthetic phytochemicals with plethora of biological activities could be one of the potentially effective options in the fight against this problem. However, there is a lack of clinical trials to confirm these findings. In this review, we focused on summarization and discussion of the general features of metastatic cancer, and recent preclinical and clinical studies dealing with anti-metastatic potential of various plant-derived compounds.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, we can conclude and confirm our hypothesis that phytochemicals with pleiotropic anticancer effects can be very useful in retarding and/or reversing the metastasis process, and can also be used to prevent tissue invasion and metastases. But, further studies in this area are certainly necessary and desirable.",J. Cancer Res. Clin.

In the process of cancer development, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is crucial to promoting the invasion and migration of tumor cells. In a previous study, the role of resveratrol in migration and metastasis was investigated in MDA-MB-231 (MDA231) human breast cancer cells and a xenograft-bearing mouse model. Additionally, the related mechanism was explored. In the present study, in vitro Transwell assays showed that resveratrol can inhibit the migration of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1-induced MDA231 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that resveratrol can reduce the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. Immunofluorescence was performed to confirm the expression of EMT-related markers. Immunofluorescence assays confirmed that resveratrol changed the expression of the EMT-related markers E-cadherin and vimentin. Western blot analysis demonstrated that resveratrol decreased the expression levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, Fibronectin, α-SMA, P-PI3K, P-AKT, Smad2, Smad3, P-Smad2, P-Smad3, vimentin, Snail1, and Slug, as well as increased the expression levels of E-cadherin in MDA231 cells. In vivo, resveratrol inhibited lung metastasis in a mouse model bearing MDA231 human breast cancer xenografts without marked changes in body weight or liver and kidney function. These results indicate that resveratrol inhibits the migration of MDA231 cells by reversing TGF-β1-induced EMT and inhibits the lung metastasis of MDA231 human breast cancer in a xenograft-bearing mouse model.",Molecules,2019,"['Sun Y', 'Zhou QM', 'Lu YY', 'Zhang H', 'Chen QL', 'Zhao M', 'Su SB']",
30901662,Chrysotobibenzyl inhibition of lung cancer cell migration through Caveolin-1-dependent mediation of the integrin switch and the sensitization of lung cancer cells to cisplatin-mediated apoptosis.,"BACKGROUND: A Lung cancer death account for approximately 1 in 5 of all cancer-related deaths and is particularly virulent due to its enhanced metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy. Chrysotobibenzyl has been reported to decrease cell metastasis, according to the results of an anchorage-independent growth assay; however, its underlying mechanism has not been investigated yet.
PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of chrysotobibenzyl on lung cancer cell migration and drug sensitization and its mechanism.
METHODS: Cell viability, cell proliferation and drug sensitization were determined by MTT assay. Cell migration was analyzed using a wound-healing assay. Transwell migration and invasion were analyzed using Boyden chamber assay. Mechanisms of chrysotobibenzyl against metastasis including cell migration, invasion, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) were evaluated by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence.
RESULTS: Treatment with chrysotobibenzyl was applied at concentrations of 0-50 µM and the results showed non-cytotoxicity in human lung cancer cells (H460, H292, A549, and H23) and other non-cancerous human cells (HCT116, primary DP1 and primary DP2). However, 50 µM of chrysotobibenzyl significantly altered cell proliferation in H292 cells at 48 h. In addition, 1-50 µM of chrysotobibenzyl significantly inhibited H460 and H292 cell migration, invasion, filopodia formation, and decreased EMT in a dose-dependent manner at 48 h, which were correlated with reduced protein levels of integrins β1, β3, and αν, p-FAK, p-AKT, Cdc42, and Cav-1. We also established shRNA-Cav-1-transfected (shCav-1) H460 and H292 cells. shCav-1 transfected cells can decrease cell migration and downregulate the expression of integrins β1, β3, and αν when compared with the control. Moreover, chrysotobibenzyl was shown to suppress EMT indicated by the reduction of EMT markers (Vimentin, Snail, and Slug), and sensitize lung cancer cells to cisplatin-mediated apoptosis.
CONCLUSION: Treatment with chrysotobibenzyl inhibited lung cancer cell migration via Cav-1, integrins β1, β3, and αν, and EMT suppressions. The downregulation of integrins in response to the compound not only inhibited cell metastasis, but also sensitized lung cancer cells to cisplatin-mediated apoptosis.",Phytomedicine,2019,"['Petpiroon N', 'Bhummaphan N', 'Tungsukruthai S', 'Pinkhien T', 'Maiuthed A', 'Sritularak B', 'Chanvorachote P']",
30899277,Inhibition of miR-9-5p suppresses prostate cancer progress by targeting StarD13.,"Background: This study aims to investigate the effects of inhibiting microRNA-9-5p (miR-9-5p) on the expression of StAR-related lipid transfer domain containing 13 (StarD13) and the progress of prostate cancer.
Methods: The mRNA expression levels of miR-9-5p and StarD13 were determined in several prostate cancer cell lines. We chose DU145 and PC-3 cells for further research. The CCK8 assay was used to measure the cell viability. The cell invasion and wound-healing assays were respectively applied to evaluate invasion and migration. The expression of E-cadherin (E-cad), N-cadherin (N-cad) and vimentin were measured via western blot. DU145 and PC-3 cells overexpressing StarD13 were generated to investigate the variation in proliferation, invasion and migration. A luciferase reporter assay was used to identify the target of miR-9-5p.
Results: Our results show that miR-9-5p was highly expressed and StarD13 was suppressed in prostate cancer cells. MiR-9-5p inhibition repressed the cells' viability, invasion and migration. It also increased the expression of E-cad and decreased that of N-cad and vimentin. StarD13 overexpression gave the same results as silencing of miR-9-5p: suppression of cell proliferation, invasion and migration. The bioinformatics analysis predicted StarD13 as a target gene of miR-9-5p. Quantitative RT-PCR, western blot analysis and the dual-luciferase reporter assay were employed to confirm the prediction.
Conclusion: Our results show that miR-9-5p plays a powerful role in the growth, invasion, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of prostate cancer cells by regulating StarD13.

We are interested in isolating the naturally-derived small-molecule inhibitor that could simultaneously targeting TGFβ/BMP pathways and further studying its anti-proliferative/-metastatic effects as well as the underlying mechanisms in multiple tumor models.
METHODS: Multiple in vitro cell-based assays are used to examine the compound's inhibitory efficacy on TNBC cell growth, stemness, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion and migration by targeting TGFβ/BMP signaling pathways. Transgenic breast cancer mouse model (MMTV-PyMT), subcutaneous xenograft and bone metastasis models are used to examine ZL170's effects on TNBC growth and metastasis potentials in vivo.
RESULTS: ZL170 dose-dependently inhibits cell proliferation, EMT, stemness, invasion and migration in vitro via specifically targeting canonical TGFβ/BMP-SMADs pathways in TNBC cells. The compound significantly hinders osteolytic bone metastasis and xenograft tumor growth without inflicting toxicity on vital organs of tumor-bearing nude mice. ZL170 strongly inhibits primary tumor growth and lung metastases in MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice. ZL170-treated tumors exhibit impaired TGFβ/BMP signaling pathways in both epithelial and stromal compartments, thereby creating a suppressive tumor microenvironment characterized by reduced extracellular matrix deposition and decreased infiltration of stromal cells.
CONCLUSIONS: ZL170 inhibits tumor EMT, stemness and metastasis and could be further developed as a potent anti-metastatic agent used in combination with cytotoxic drugs for treatment of TNBC and other advanced metastatic cancers.",J.

30896886,Downregulation of cytokeratin 18 enhances BCRP-mediated multidrug resistance through induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and predicts poor prognosis in breast cancer.,"Multiple drug resistance (MDR) and metastasis have been identified as the two major causes of the poor prognosis of patients with breast cancer. However, the relationship between MDR and metastasis has not been characterized. Epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process known to promote metastasis in cancer, has been shown to be associated with the MDR phenotype of many tumor types. Reduced cytokeratin 18 (CK18) expression is thought to be one of the hallmarks of EMT, and the role of CK18 in MDR of metastatic breast cancer remains unknown. In the present study, we revealed that the expression of CK18 was significantly downregulated in breast cancer tissues and in an MDR cell line overexpressing breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP), and the presence of low levels of CK18 was associated with TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, and unfavorable survival in breast cancer patients. Further results demonstrated that CK18 stable knockdown using shRNA increased BCRP expression and induced the EMT process in human breast cancer MCF‑7 cells. Moreover, CK18 knockdown was associated with the activation of the NF‑κB/Snail signaling pathway, which has been revealed to regulate EMT and BCRP. Based on these findings, we concluded that CK18 knockdown enhanced BCRP‑mediated MDR in MCF‑7 cells through EMT induction partly via the NF‑κB/Snail pathway. These findings provide a valuable insight into the potential role of CK18 in MDR, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Reduced expression of CK18 may be a novel biomarker for predicting the poor prognosis of breast cancer patients.",Oncol.

30896877,miR-363 acts as a tumor suppressor in osteosarcoma cells by inhibiting PDZD2.,"PDZ domain containing 2 (PDZD2) is a multi-PDZ domain protein that promotes the proliferation of insulinoma cells, and is upregulated during prostate tumorigenesis. However, the function of PDZD2 in other cancers, including osteosarcoma (OS), remains unclear. Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) contributes to tumor initiation, proliferation and metastasis, via the regulation of their target genes. The present study investigated the functions of miR-363 and PDZD2 in MG-63 OS cells. The results revealed that MG-63 cells contained low levels of miR-363, and that overexpression of miR-363 in MG-63 cells significantly inhibited the vitality, proliferation, and colony formation ability of the cells, but promoted their apoptosis and G1/S arrest by regulating proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and caspase-3 expression. Additionally, miR-363 impaired the migration and invasion of MG-63 cells by regulating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. Notably, a bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay indicated that PDZD2 was a direct target of miR-363. miR-363 overexpression reduced PDZD2 protein levels and knockdown of PDZD2 suppressed the colony formation, migration and invasion of MG-63 cells, but promoted their apoptosis by regulating expression of PCNA, caspase-3, and the EMT phenotype. In vivo studies further confirmed that miR-363 functioned as tumor suppressor, by inhibiting tumor growth, promoting cell apoptosis, and reducing PDZD2 and PCNA levels and the prevalence of the EMT phenotype in tumor tissues.

To determine whether the inhibitory effect of astragaloside IV on the invasion and metastasis of the cervical cancer cells is associated with epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT), wound healing and Transwell assays were performed using SiHa cervical cancer cells and demonstrated that astragaloside IV inhibited invasion and migration of human SiHa cervical cancer cells in vitro. Immunocytochemical and western blot analyses indicated that astragaloside IV inhibited EMT by affecting the expression of transforming growth factor‑β1 (TGF‑β1) and E‑cadherin in the cancer cells. Two Smad‑independent pathways mediated by TGF‑β1 were identified to be associated with the effects of astragaloside IV, namely, mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways. The data indicated that astragaloside IV has inhibitory effects on phosphorylation of P38 MAPK, PI3K, AKT and mTOR of SiHa cells of cervical cancer. Furthermore, MAPK and PI3K pathway inhibitors were administered to the cancer cells and the expression of E‑cadherin, a marker of EMT, was determined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results demonstrated that MAPK and PI3K pathways were involved in the inhibitory effect of astragaloside IV on EMT. In vivo small animal imaging techniques was performed and demonstrated that astragaloside IV inhibited the metastasis of cervical cancer cells.

Aberrant expression of miR‑9 has been reported to be involved in the tumorigenesis and progression of various malignancies. However, its role in prostate cancer (PC) has not been completely clarified. In the present study, miR‑9 expression was examined in different PC cell lines, patient tissues and a mouse model. Cell Counting Kit‑8 and BrdU immunoﬂuorescence assays were performed to assess the effect of miR‑9 on the viability of PC cells, while Transwell and wound‑healing assays were utilized to evaluate the migration and invasion of PC cells expressing miR‑9. Furthermore, a dual‑luciferase reporter assay was performed to verify whether mitogen‑activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3 (MEKK3) was a direct target of miR‑9. The results demonstrated significant downregulation of miR‑9 expression in different PC cell lines and 31 human PC tissues, as compared with that in a normal prostate cell line and adjacent normal tissues, respectively. By contrast, upregulation of MEKK3 was confirmed in human PC tissue samples, with its level inversely associated with miR‑9 expression. Overexpression of miR‑9 in six different PC cell lines (DU145, LNCaP, 22Rv1, PC‑3, C4‑2B and VCaP) reduced the cell viability and migration. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the 3'‑untranslated region of MEKK3 was a target of miR‑9, and that MEKK3 overexpression prevented the inhibitory effects of miR‑9 on the viability, migration and invasion of PC cells. miR‑9 overexpressing tumor cells also exhibited growth delay in comparison with control tumor cells in vivo.

30896071,Reduced USP33 expression in gastric cancer decreases inhibitory effects of Slit2-Robo1 signalling on cell migration and EMT.,"OBJECTIVES: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common cancers in the world, causing a large number of deaths every year. The Slit-Robo signalling pathway, initially discovered for its critical role in neuronal guidance, has recently been shown to modulate tumour invasion and metastasis in several human cancers. However, the role of Slit-Robo signalling and the molecular mechanisms underlying its role in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer remains to be elucidated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Slit2, Robo1 and USP33 expressions were analysed in datasets obtained from the Oncomine database and measured in human gastric cancer specimens. The function of Slit2-Robo1-USP33 signalling on gastric cancer cells migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was studied both in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism of the interaction between Robo1 and USP33 was explored by co-IP and ubiquitination protein analysis.
RESULTS: The mRNA and protein levels of Slit2 and Robo1 are lower in GC tissues relative to those in adjacent healthy tissues. Importantly, Slit2 inhibits GC cell migration and suppresses EMT process in a Robo-dependent manner. The inhibitory function of Slit2-Robo1 is mediated by ubiquitin-specific protease 33 (USP33) via deubiquitinating and stabilizing Robo1. USP33 expression is decreased in GC tissues, and reduced USP33 level is correlated with poor patient survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals the inhibitory function of Slit-Robo signalling in GC and uncovers a role of USP33 in suppressing cancer cell migration and EMT by enhancing Slit2-Robo1 signalling.

So far, the major focus of studies on KK-LC-1 has been on its potential as diagnostic biomarker and immunotherapy target. However, its biological functions and molecular mechanisms in cancer progression remain unknown.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expression of KK-LC-1 in HCC was analysed using RT-qPCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. The roles of KK-LC-1 on HCC progression were examined by loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches. Pathway inhibitor DAPT was employed to confirm the regulatory effect of KK-LC-1 on the downstream Notch signalling. The interaction of KK-LC-1 with presenilin-1 was determined by co-immunoprecipitation. The association of CpG island methylation status with KK-LC-1 reactivation was evaluated by methylation-specific PCR, bisulphite sequencing PCR and 5-Aza-dC treatment.
RESULTS: We identified that HCC tissues exhibited increased levels of KK-LC-1. High KK-LC-1 level independently predicted poor survival outcome. KK-LC-1 promoted cell growth, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in vitro and in vivo. KK-LC-1 modulated the Notch1/Hes1 pathway to exacerbate HCC progression through physically interacting with presenilin-1. Upregulation of KK-LC-1 in HCC was attributed to hypomethylated CpG islands.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified that hypomethylation-induced KK-LC-1 overexpression played an important role in HCC progression and independently predicted poor survival.

Recently, multiple research groups provided solid evidence of citrullination being in control of cancer progression; however, there is no comprehensive overview of these findings. This article summarizes and critically reviews the influence of citrullination on different aspects of tumor biology, including (i) regulation of apoptosis and differentiation, (ii) promoting EMT and metastasis, and (iii) potential use of citrullinated antigens for immunotherapy. In addition, (iv) the role of citrullination as a cancer biomarker and (v) implication of neutrophil extracellular traps in tumorigenesis are discussed.

30891677,TGF-β Inhibitors in Metastatic Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancerrelated mortality in the USA, and the overall incidence of the disease is increasing such that it is expected to be the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the next decade. Minimal improvements in therapy have not changed the overall mortality rate over the past decade for patients with PDAC. The purpose of this review is to identify new data regardign the role of Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) based therapeuics in patients with PDAC.
METHODS: The literature was searched for peer reviewed manuscripts regarding the use of TGF-β inhibitors in PDAC therapy and the mechanism in which TGF-β intracellular signaling effects patient survival.
RESULTS: TGF-β plays a vital, context-dependent role as both a tumor suppressor and promoter of PDAC. The downstream effects of this duality play a significant role in the immunologic response of the tumor microenvironment (TME), epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT), and the development of metastatic disease. Immunologic pathways have been shown to be successful targets in the treatment of other diseases, though they have not been shown efficacious in PDAC. TGF-β-mediated EMT does play a critical role in PDAC progression in the development of metastases.

30890278,MicroRNA-374a promotes pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition by targeting SRCIN1.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a vital role in the progress of cancer. Whereas the expression and function of miR-374a in pancreatic cancer remain largely unknown. In this study, pancreatic cancer samples and its adjacent normal tissues were obtained from 30 clinical patients with pancreatic cancer. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to measure miR-374a and SRC Kinase Signaling Inhibitor 1 (SRCIN1) expression. Western blotting assay was performed to measure the levels of SRCIN1, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and β-catenin in PANC-1 cells. Luciferase reporter assay was conducted to confirm the direct targeting of SRCIN1 by miR-374a. Cell proliferation and migration assays were utilized to analyze the role of miR-374a in PANC-1 cells. We found that miR-374a expression was upregulated in pancreatic cancer tissues and cell lines. Over-expression of miR-374a promoted cell proliferation, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in pancreatic cancer. While, SRCIN1 expression was downregulated in pancreatic cancer tissues and cells. SRCIN1 was found to be a potential targets of miR-374a by dual-luciferase reporter assay. And SRCIN1 was down-regulated after miR-374a transfection. More than that, over-expression of SRCIN1 inhibited cell proliferation, migration and EMT in pancreatic cancer cell. Therefore, this study revealed that miR-374a promoted cell proliferation, migration and EMT via targeting SRCIN1 in pancreatic cancer.",Pathol. Res. Pract.,2019,"['Ma L', 'Shao Z', 'Zhao Y']",
30890168,Exosome-transmitted miR-128-3p increase chemosensitivity of oxaliplatin-resistant colorectal cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Oxaliplatin resistance is a major challenge for treatment of advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). Both acquisition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and suppressed drug accumulation in cancer cells contributes to development of oxaliplatin resistance. Aberrant expression of small noncoding RNA, miR-128-3p, has been shown to be a key regulator in tumorigenesis and cancer development. However, its roles in the progression of CRC and oxaliplatin-resistance are largely unknown.
METHODS: Oxaliplatin-resistant CRC and normal intestinal FHC cells were transfected with a miR-128-3p expression lentivirus. After transfection, FHC-derived exosomes were isolated and co-cultured with CRC cells. miR-128-3p expression in resistant CRC cells, FHC cells, and exosomes was quantified by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). The mRNA and protein levels of miR-128-3p target genes in resistant CRC cells were quantified by RT-qPCR and western blot, respectively. The effects of miR-128-3p on CRC cell viability, apoptosis, EMT, motility and drug efflux were evaluated by CCK8, flow cytometry, Transwell and wound healing assays, immunofluorescence, and atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Xenograft models were used to determine whether miR-128-3p loaded exosomes can re-sensitize CRC cells to oxaliplatin in vivo.
RESULTS: In our established stable oxaliplatin-resistant CRC cell lines, in vitro and vivo studies revealed miR-128-3p suppressed EMT and increased intracellular oxaliplatin accumulation. Importantly, our results indicated that lower miR-128-3p expression was associated with poor oxaliplatin response in advanced human CRC patients. Moreover, data showed that miR-128-3p-transfected FHC cells effectively packaged miR-128-3p into secreted exosomes and mediated miR-128-3p delivery to oxaliplatin-resistant cells, improving oxaliplatin response in CRC cells both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, miR-128-3p overexpression up-regulated E-cadherin levels and inhibited oxaliplatin-induced EMT by suppressing Bmi1 expression in resistant cells. Meanwhile, it also decreased oxaliplatin efflux through suppressed expression of the drug transporter MRP5.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that miR-128-3p delivery via exosomes represents a novel strategy enhancing chemosensitivity in CRC through negative regulation of Bmi1 and MRP5. Moreover, miR-128-3p may be a promising diagnostic and prognostic marker for oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.",Mol.

30890157,Pancreatic cancer-initiating cell exosome message transfer into noncancer-initiating cells: the importance of CD44v6 in reprogramming.,"BACKGROUND: Cancer-initiating cell (CIC) exosomes (CIC-TEX) are suggested reprogramming Non-CIC. Mode of message transfer and engagement of CIC-markers being disputed, we elaborated the impact of CD44v6 and Tspan8 on the response of Non-CIC.
METHODS: Non-metastasizing CD44v6- and Tspan8-knockdown (kd) pancreatic cancer cells served as Non-CIC. CIC-TEX coculture-induced changes were evaluated by deep-sequencing and functional assays. Tumor progression was surveyed during in vivo CIC-TEX treatment.
RESULTS: Deep-sequencing of CIC-TEX-cocultured CD44v6kd-Non-CIC revealed pronounced mRNA changes in signaling, transport, transcription and translation; altered miRNA affected metabolism, signaling and transcription. CIC-TEX coculture-induced changes in Tspan8kd-Non-CIC mostly relied on CIC-TEX-Tspan8 being required for targeting. CIC-TEX transfer supported apoptosis resistance and significantly promoted epithelial mesenchymal transition, migration, invasion and (lymph)angiogenesis of the kd Non-CIC in vitro and in vivo, deep-sequencing allowing individual mRNA and miRNA assignment to altered functions. Importantly, CIC-TEX act as a hub, initiated by CD44v6-dependent RTK, GPCR and integrin activation and involving CD44v6-assisted transcription and RNA processing. Accordingly, a kinase inhibitor hampered CIC-TEX-fostered tumor progression, which was backed by an anti-Tspan8 blockade of CIC-TEX binding.
CONCLUSIONS: This in depth report on the in vitro and in vivo impact of CIC-TEX on CD44v6kd and Tspan8kd Non-CIC unravels hub CIC-TEX activity, highlighting a prominent contribution of the CIC-markers CD44v6 to signaling cascade activation, transcription, translation and miRNA processing in Non-CIC and of Tspan8 to CIC-TEX targeting. Blocking CIC-TEX binding/uptake and uptake-initiated target cell activation significantly mitigated the deleterious CIC-TEX impact on CD44v6kd and Tspan8kd Non-CIC.",J. Exp. Clin.

30886504,Short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 3 exhibits tumor-suppressing effects in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.,"BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors with high mortality-to-incidence ratios. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 3 (NFE2L3), also known as NRF3, is a member of the cap 'n' collar basic-region leucine zipper family of transcription factors. NFE2L3 is involved in the regulation of various biological processes, whereas its role in HCC has not been elucidated.
AIM: To explore the expression and biological function of NFE2L3 in HCC.
METHODS: We analyzed the expression of NFE2L3 in HCC tissues and its correlation with clinicopathological parameters based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data portal. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) interference technology was utilized to knock down NFE2L3 
RESULTS: TCGA analysis showed that NFE2L3 expression was significantly positively correlated with tumor grade, T stage, and pathologic stage. The qPCR and Western blot results showed that both the mRNA and protein levels of NFE2L3 were significantly decreased after shRNA-mediated knockdown in BEL-7404 and SMMC-7721 cells. The shRNA-mediated knockdown of NFE2L3 could induce apoptosis and inhibit the clone formation and cell proliferation of SMMC-7721 and BEL-7404 cells. NFE2L3 knockdown also significantly suppressed the migration, invasion, and EMT of the two cell lines.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that shRNA-mediated knockdown of NFE2L3 exhibited tumor-suppressing effects in HCC cells.",World J. Gastroenterol.,2019,"['Yu MM', 'Feng YH', 'Zheng L', 'Zhang J', 'Luo GH']",
30885238,Expression of zinc finger transcription factors (ZNF143 and ZNF281) in serous borderline ovarian tumors and low-grade ovarian cancers.,"Low-grade ovarian cancers represent up to 8% of all epithelial ovarian carcinomas (EOCs). Recent studies demonstrated that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is crucial for the progression of EOCs. EMT plays a key role in cancer invasion, metastasis formation and chemotherapy resistance. An array of novel EMT transcription factors from the zinc finger protein family have been described recently, among them zinc finger protein 143 (ZNF143) and zinc finger protein 281 (ZNF281). The study included tissue specimens from 42 patients. Based on histopathological examination of surgical specimens, eight lesions were classified as serous borderline ovarian tumors (sBOTs) and 34 as low-grade EOCs. The proportions of the ovarian tumors that tested positively for ZNF143 and ZNF281 were 90 and 57%, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found in the expressions of ZNF143 and ZNF281 transcription factors in SBOTs and low-grade EOCs. Considering the expression patterns for ZNF143 and ZNF281 identified in this study, both sBOTs and low-grade EOCs might undergo a dynamic epithelial-mesenchymal interconversion. The lack of statistically significant differences in the expressions of the zinc finger proteins in sBOTs and low-grade serous EOCs might constitute an evidence for common origin of these two tumor types.",J Ovarian Res,2019,"['Sadłecki P', 'Grabiec M', 'Grzanka D', 'Jóźwicki J', 'Antosik P', 'Walentowicz-Sadłecka M']",
30885232,"MCT-1/miR-34a/IL-6/IL-6R signaling axis promotes EMT progression, cancer stemness and M2 macrophage polarization in triple-negative breast cancer.","BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a poor prognostic breast cancer with the highest mutations and limited therapeutic choices. Cytokine networking between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME) maintains the self-renewing subpopulation of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) that mediate tumor heterogeneity, resistance and recurrence. Immunotherapy of those factors combined with targeted therapy or chemoagents may advantage TNBC treatment.
RESULTS: We found that the oncogene Multiple Copies in T-cell Malignancy 1 (MCT-1/MCTS1) expression is a new poor-prognosis marker in patients with aggressive breast cancers. Overexpressing MCT-1 perturbed the oncogenic breast epithelial acini morphogenesis and stimulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition and matrix metalloproteinase activation in invasive TNBC cells, which were repressed after MCT-1 gene silencing. As mammary tumor progression was promoted by oncogenic MCT-1 activation, tumor-promoting M2 macrophages were enriched in TME, whereas M2 macrophages were decreased and tumor-suppressive M1 macrophages were increased as the tumor was repressed via MCT-1 knockdown. MCT-1 stimulated interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion that promoted monocytic THP-1 polarization into M2-like macrophages to increase TNBC cell invasiveness. In addition, MCT-1 elevated the soluble IL-6 receptor levels, and thus, IL-6R antibodies antagonized the effect of MCT-1 on promoting M2-like polarization and cancer cell invasion. Notably, MCT-1 increased the features of BCSCs, which were further advanced by IL-6 but prevented by tocilizumab, a humanized IL-6R antibody, thus MCT-1 knockdown and tocilizumab synergistically inhibited TNBC stemness. Tumor suppressor miR-34a was induced upon MCT-1 knockdown that inhibited IL-6R expression and activated M1 polarization.
CONCLUSIONS: The MCT-1 pathway is a novel and promising therapeutic target for TNBC.",Mol. Cancer,2019,"['Weng YS', 'Tseng HY', 'Chen YA', 'Shen PC', 'Al Haq AT', 'Chen LM', 'Tung YC', 'Hsu HL']",
30885209,NF-κB upregulates glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 2 to promote migration in non-small cell lung cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) results in changes that promote de-differentiation, migration, and invasion in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). While it is recognized that EMT promotes altered energy utilization, identification of metabolic pathways that link EMT with cancer progression is needed. Work presented here indicates that mesenchymal NSCLC upregulates glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 2 (GFPT2). GFPT2 is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). UDP-GlcNAc is the obligate activator of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT).
METHODS: Analysis of our transcriptomic data indicates that GFPT2 is one of the most significantly upregulated metabolic genes in mesenchymal NSCLC. Ectopic GFPT2 expression, as well as gene silencing strategies were used to determine the importance of this metabolic enzyme in regulating EMT-driven processes of cell motility and invasion.
RESULTS: Our work demonstrates that GFPT2 is transcriptionally upregulated by NF-κB and repressed by the NAD
CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with GFPT2 promoting cancer progression, we find that elevated GFPT2 expression correlates with poor clinical outcome in NSCLC. Modulation of GFPT2 activity offers a potentially important therapeutic target to combat NSCLC disease progression.",Cell Commun.

30885118,MGSEA - a multivariate Gene set enrichment analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is a powerful tool to identify enriched functional categories of informative biomarkers. Canonical GSEA takes one-dimensional feature scores derived from the data of one platform as inputs. Numerous extensions of GSEA handling multimodal OMIC data are proposed, yet none of them explicitly captures combinatorial relations of feature scores from multiple platforms.
RESULTS: We propose multivariate GSEA (MGSEA) to capture combinatorial relations of gene set enrichment among multiple platform features. MGSEA successfully captures designed feature relations from simulated data. By applying it to the scores of delineating breast cancer and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) subtypes from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets of CNV, DNA methylation and mRNA expressions, we find that breast cancer and GBM data yield both similar and distinct outcomes. Among the enriched functional categories, subtype-specific biomarkers are dominated by mRNA expression in many functional categories in both cancer types and also by CNV in many functional categories in breast cancer. The enriched functional categories belonging to distinct combinatorial patterns are involved different oncogenic processes: cell proliferation (such as cell cycle control, estrogen responses, MYC and E2F targets) for mRNA expression in breast cancer, invasion and metastasis (such as cell adhesion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)) for CNV in breast cancer, and diverse processes (such as immune and inflammatory responses, cell adhesion, angiogenesis, and EMT) for mRNA expression in GBM. These observations persist in two external datasets (Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) for breast cancer and Repository for Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data (REMBRANDT) for GBM) and are consistent with knowledge of cancer subtypes. We further compare the characteristics of MGSEA with several extensions of GSEA and point out the pros and cons of each method.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the utility of MGSEA by inferring the combinatorial relations of multiple platforms for cancer subtype delineation in three multi-OMIC datasets: TCGA, METABRIC and REMBRANDT. The inferred combinatorial patterns are consistent with the current knowledge and also reveal novel insights about cancer subtypes. MGSEA can be further applied to any genotype-phenotype association problems with multimodal OMIC data.",BMC Bioinformatics,2019,"['Tiong KL', 'Yeang CH']",

30883979,miR-664a-3p functions as an oncogene by targeting Hippo pathway in the development of gastric cancer.,"OBJECTIVES: It has been accounted that miR-664a-3p has different functions in several malignancies; however, the precise role and underlying mechanism in gastric cancer have not been elucidated. Our study aims to explore the function of miR-664a-3p on the progression of gastric cancer (GC).
METHODS: qRT-PCR was applied to detect the expression of miR-664a-3p in GC tissues and cells. The functions of miR-664a-3p on GC in vitro were examined by cell proliferation assay, and transwell assay. Related proteins of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and signal pathway were evaluated by Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis. The bioinformatic, dual-luciferase assay or ChIP assay were employed to identify the interaction between miR-664a-3p and its target gene or Foxp3. The effects in vivo were investigated through a mouse tumorigenicity model.
RESULTS: miR-664a-3p was frequently upregulated in GC tissues and cells. Elevated expression of miR-664a-3p significantly promoted proliferation and invasion in vitro and in vivo. MOB1A was confirmed to be a target of miR-664a-3p and restoration of MOB1A attenuated the effects of miR-664a-3p. A series of investigations indicated that miR-664a-3p contributed to EMT process and inactivated the Hippo pathway by downregulating MOB1A.

30880778,Epigenetic deregulations of Wnt/β-catenin and transforming growth factor beta-Smad pathways in esophageal cancer: Outcome of DNA methylation.,"Background: Promoter methylation of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) is a well-reported portent in carcinogenesis; hence, it is worthy to investigate this in high-risk Northeast population of India. The study was designed to investigate methylation status of 94 TSGs in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Further, the effect of OPCML promoter methylation on gene expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Moreover, in silico protein-protein interactions were examined among 8 TSGs identified in the present study and 23 epigenetically regulated genes reported previously by our group in ESCC.
Materials and Methods: Methylation profiling was carried out by polymerase chain reaction array and OPCML protein expression was examined by tissue microarray-based immunohistochemistry.
Results: OPCML, NEUROG1, TERT, and WT1 genes were found hypermethylated and SCGB3A1, CDH1, THBS1, and VEGFA were hypomethylated in Grade 2 tumor. No significant change in OPCML expression was observed among control, Grade 1, and Grade 2 tumor. Conclusively, hypermethylation of the studied OPCML promoter in Grade 2 tumor produced no effect on expression. Unexpectedly, OPCML expression was downregulated in Grade 3 tumor in comparison to other groups signifying that downregulation of OPCML expression may lead to higher grade of tumor formation at the time of diagnosis of ESCC in patients. Significant interactions at protein level were found as VEGFA:PTK2, CTNNB1:CDH1, CTNNB1:VEGFA, CTNNB1:NEUROG1, CTNND2:CDH1, and CTNNB1:TERT. These interactions are pertinent to Wnt/β-catenin and TGF-β-Smad pathways.
Conclusions: Deranged OPCML expression may lead to high-grade ESCC as well as epigenetically regulated genes, that is, CDH1, CTNNB1, CTNND2, THBS1, PTK2, WT1, OPCML, TGFB1, and SMAD4 may alter the Wnt/β-catenin and TGF-β-Smad pathways in ESCC.

So, there is an immediate requirement for the search of a novel therapeutic target for treatment of this cancer. Acquired tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 (MCF-7/TAM-R) and T47D (T47D/TAM-R) showed higher apoptotic resistance accompanied by induction of pro-survival autophagy compared to their parental cells. Besides, tamoxifen resistance was associated with reduced production of ATP and with overexpression of glycolytic pathways, leading to induced autophagy to meet the energy demand. Further, our study revealed that LDHA; one of the key molecules of glycolysis in association with Beclin-1 induced pro-survival autophagy in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer. Mechanistically, pharmacological and genetic inhibition of LDHA reduced the pro-survival autophagy, with the restoration of apoptosis and reverting back the EMT like phenomena noticed in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer.

30878022,Role of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Tumor Progression.,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a fundamental process of morphogenesis whereby epithelial cells acquire the mesenchymal phenotype. Multiple data suggest a critical role of EMT in tumor progression. In carcinomas, EMT can be initiated and promoted by many oncogenic signaling pathways, hypoxia, and signals of tumor microenvironment resulting in epithelial cells losing their cell polarity and cell-cell adhesion and gaining the migratory and invasive properties. Downregulation of expression of the cell adhesion protein E-cadherin is considered a poor prognostic factor in cancer. Many tumors are characterized by incomplete EMT, where tumor cells acquire mesenchymal characteristics but retain their epithelial markers, in particular, E-cadherin. In cells with the hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal phenotype, E-cadherin is accumulated in adherens junctions which are less stable than adherens junctions in normal epithelial cells. E-cadherin-based adherens junctions are essential for efficient collective migration and invasion of carcinoma cells, and their survival in metastasis. The plasticity of the hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal phenotype improves adaptive capabilities of cancer cells. By undergoing EMT, carcinoma cells become resistant to chemotherapy and acquire the ability to suppress immune response. Emergence of cancer stem cells after EMT activation has been observed in many types of carcinoma.",Biochemistry Mosc.,2018,"['Gloushankova NA', 'Zhitnyak IY', 'Rubtsova SN']",

JDP2, acted as a repressor of AP-1 complex, was a member of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor family. RT-qPCR was applied to evaluate miR-501 and JDP2 expression level and we found that miR-501 was upregulated in HCC tissues and cells. miR-501 ectopic expression promoted HCC cell invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), while low expression present the opposite results. JDP2 was downregulated in HCC tissues and cells, and overexpressed JDP2 facilitated HCC cell invasion and EMT. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assay indicated that JDP2 was a target of miR-501 and altered miR-501 expression the JPD2 mRNA may changed. The expression of miR-501 and JDP2 had negative connection in HCC tissues. In addition, Kaplan-Meier method revealed that miR-501 upregulation or JDP2 downregulation predicted poor prognosis in HCC patients. miR-501 promoted cell invasion and EMT by regulated JDP2 in hepatocellular carcinoma.

30877623,Leptin-induced signaling pathways in cancer cell migration and invasion.,"BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence indicates that obesity is associated with tumor development and progression. Leptin is an adipocyte-related hormone with a key role in energy metabolism and whose circulating levels are elevated in obesity. The effect of leptin on cancer progression and metastasis and its underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Leptin can impact various steps in tumor metastasis, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM), and proteolysis of ECM components. To do so, leptin binds to its receptor (OB-Rb) to activate signaling pathways and downstream effectors that participate in tumor cell invasion as well as distant metastasis.
CONCLUSIONS: In this review, we describe metastasis steps in detail and characterize metastasis-related molecules activated by leptin, which may help to develop a roadmap that guides future work.

The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is highly associated with cancer metastasis. Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), the most abundant anthocyanin pigment enriched in fresh fruits and vegetables, showed ideal anti-oxidant property. C3G could also inhibit certain malignant behaviors of cancer cells, however, whether repression of EMT was involved in its anti-cancer especially TNBC effect remains unknown. Herein, we report that C3G decreases the migratory and invasive nature of TNBC lines MDA-MB-231 and BT-549. Mechanistically, C3G induces reversion of EMT characterized by phenotype modulation with increased epithelial marker E-ca and ZO-1, decreased mesenchymal marker Vimentin, N-ca and EMT-associated transcription factors Snail1, Snail2. NF-κB is pivotal for EMT and Sirt1 is a NF-κB inhibitor. We show that NF-κB is attenuated and Sirt1 is induced by C3G in TNBC, respectively. And later evidence demonstrates that abrogation of Sirt1 with small interfering RNA transfection abolished NF-κB inhibition and EMT reversion by C3G. Subsequently, we show that microRNA-138(miR-138) represses Sirt1 via mRNA translation inhibition and is inhibited by C3G. Moreover, miR-138 repression is involved in Sirt1 re-activation and migratory and invasive inhibition of TNBC by C3G.

Higher levels of LIMK1 are reported during the progression of many cancers. Our study explored the interaction between LIMK1 and miR-106a in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).
Methods: Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to detect the levels of LIMK1 and miR-106a in OSCC tissues and cell lines. The rates of cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were assessed to determine the biological functions of miR-106a and LIMK1 in OSCC cells. The mRNA and protein levels of LIMK1 were measured using quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting. Luciferase assays were performed to validate LIMK1 as an miR-106a target in OSCC cells.
Results: We found that the level of miR-106a significantly decreased and the expression of LIMK1 significantly increased in OSCC tissues and cell lines. There was a close association between these changes. Knockdown of LIMK1 significantly inhibited the proliferation and EMT of OSCC cells. The bioinformatics analysis predicted that LIMK1 is a potential target gene of miR-106a and the luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-106a could directly target LIMK1. Introduction of miR-106a to OSCC cells had similar effects to LIMK1 silencing. Overexpression of LIMK1 in OSCC cells partially reversed the inhibitory effects of the miR-106a mimic.

In our RNA sequencing study on gastric cancer patients, Runt-related transcription factor-3 (RUNX3) expression was significantly down-regulated in gastric cancer. We showed that decreased levels of RUNX3 are significantly associated with c-MET (r = - 0.4216, P = 0.0130). In addition, c-MET expression is a candidate for targeted therapy in gastric cancer. Therefore, in the present study, the anti-cancer effects of the c-MET inhibitor on gastric cancer cells from positive or negative for c-MET amplification were evaluated.
RESULTS: INC280 treatment inhibits growth of a c-MET-amplified MKN45 (RUNX3-positive) and SNU620 (RUNX3-negative) diffuse type cells.

30866952,Hypoxic BMSC-derived exosomal miRNAs promote metastasis of lung cancer cells via STAT3-induced EMT.,"BACKGROUND: Metastasis is the main cause of lung cancer mortality. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are a component of the cancer microenvironment and contribute to cancer progression. Intratumoral hypoxia affects both cancer and stromal cells. Exosomes are recognized as mediators of intercellular communication. Here, we aim to further elucidate the communication between BMSC-derived exosomes and cancer cells in the hypoxic niche.
METHODS: Exosomal miRNA profiling was performed using a microRNA array. Lung cancer cells and an in vivo mouse syngeneic tumor model were used to evaluate the effects of select exosomal microRNAs. Hypoxic BMSC-derived plasma exosomal miRNAs were assessed for their capacity to discriminate between cancer patients and non-cancerous controls and between cancer patients with or without metastasis.
RESULTS: We demonstrate that exosomes derived from hypoxic BMSCs are taken by neighboring cancer cells and promote cancer cell invasion and EMT. Exosome-mediated transfer of select microRNAs, including miR-193a-3p, miR-210-3p and miR-5100, from BMSCs to epithelial cancer cells activates STAT3 signaling and increases the expression of mesenchymal related molecules. The diagnostic accuracy of individual microRNA showed that plasma exosomal miR-193a-3p can discriminate cancer patients from non-cancerous controls. A panel of these three plasma exosomal microRNAs showed a better diagnostic accuracy to discriminate lung cancer patients with or without metastasis than individual exosomal microRNA.
CONCLUSIONS: Exosome-mediated transfer of miR-193a-3p, miR-210-3p and miR-5100, could promote invasion of lung cancer cells by activating STAT3 signalling-induced EMT. These exosomal miRNAs may be promising noninvasive biomarkers for cancer progression.",Mol. Cancer,2019,"['Zhang X', 'Sai B', 'Wang F', 'Wang L', 'Wang Y', 'Zheng L', 'Li G', 'Tang J', 'Xiang J']",
30864736,Interaction with tumor‑associated macrophages promotes PRL‑3‑induced invasion of colorectal cancer cells via MAPK pathway‑induced EMT and NF‑κB signaling‑induced angiogenesis.,"Protein phosphatase of regenerating liver‑3 (PRL‑3) is considered to be metastasis‑associated phosphatase and is associated with a poor prognosis. Additionally, tumor‑associated macrophages (TAMs) participate in cancer progression. A previous study demonstrated that PRL‑3 promotes invasion and metastasis by inducing TAM infiltration. However, the underlying mechanism has not been elucidated. In the present study, western blot analysis, polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, mouse model experiments and functional experiments were performed to confirm that the interaction between TAMs and colorectal cancer (CRC) cells induced epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT)‑associated features in CRC cells by activating mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in TAMs and upregulating the expression of interleukin (IL)‑6 and IL‑8. The neutralization of IL‑6 and IL‑8 reduced EMT and the invasive and migratory abilities of CRC cells. Therefore, IL‑6 and IL‑8 were considered important factors in EMT, and in CRC invasion and metastasis. In addition, increased angiogenesis was observed after TAMs were co‑cultured with CRC cells that overexpress PRL‑3. Vascular endothelial growth factor‑A was significantly upregulated, and the nuclear factor‑κB (NF‑κB) signaling pathway was activated in CRC cells after co‑culture. Moreover, nude mice injected with CRC cells with high PRL‑3 expression levels tended to generate larger xenografts. Immunohistochemistry results from xenografted CRC cells overexpressing PRL‑3 also confirmed the activation of MAPK pathways in xenografts. Overall, the findings indicate that PRL‑3 promotes CRC cell invasion and metastasis by activating MAPK pathways in TAMs to initiate the EMT, and PRL‑3 promotes angiogenesis by activating the NF‑κB pathway in CRC cells.",Oncol.

30864730,Tropomodulin 3 promotes liver cancer progression by activating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway.,"Tropomodulin 3 (TMOD3) is a member of the pointed‑end capping protein family that contributes to invasion and metastasis in several types of malignancies. TMOD3 has been found to be crucial for membranous skeleton and embryonic development; however, little is known regarding the role of TMOD3 in liver cancer progression. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have investigated the mechanism underlying the TMOD3‑regulated promotion of liver cancer. The aim of the present study was to determine whether TMOD3 is associated with liver cancer progression. TMOD3 expression was found to be elevated in liver cancer cells and tissues. In the in vitro experiments, liver cancer cell proliferation, invasion and migration were inhibited by TMOD3 knockdown and promoted by ectopic expression of TMOD3. Furthermore, mechanistic analysis indicated that TMOD3 overexpression activated mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal‑regulated kinase (ERK) signaling and increased the levels of other targets of this pathway, including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2, MMP9 and cyclin D1. TMOD3 overexpression was associated with changes in liver cancer cell morphology and altered expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers. High TMOD3 expression was hypothesized to promote epithelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition in liver cancer cells. In conclusion, TMOD3 was shown to promote liver cancer cell growth, invasion and migration through the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, and it may serve as a candidate biomarker and therapeutic target in liver cancer.",Oncol.

30864719,LncRNA‑AB209371 promotes the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.,"The zinc finger protein Snail1 is an important factor in the regulation of the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. The present study demonstrated that the expression of Snail1 in HCC tissues was significantly higher compared with its expression in tissues adjacent to primary sites, as determined via western blotting. Furthermore, the results of a dual luciferase assay revealed that hsa‑microRNA(miR)199a‑5p negatively regulated the protein expression of Snail1 by binding to its 3' untranslated region. However, in a comparative analysis of primary HCC and its metastatic tissues using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, it was demonstrated that the expression of hsa‑miR199a‑5p and Snail1 in HCC metastatic tissues were significantly higher compared with primary lesions and an association between them identified that hsa‑miR199a‑5p lost its ability to negatively regulate Snail1. This result is contradictive to the fact that hsa‑miR199a‑5p inhibits the expression of the Snail1 protein. The present study hypothesized that the aberrant expression of long non‑coding RNA was the cause of hsa‑miR199a‑5p inactivation based on loss of function rather than a reduction in content. The data collected in the present study confirmed the hypothesis that AB209371 binds to hsa‑miR199a‑5p and weakened the inhibitory effect of hsa‑miR199a‑5p on Snail1 expression. In addition, an in vitro EMT model was established in the present study by inducing HCC cells with TGF‑β1. The results revealed that AB209371 silencing effectively reversed the hsa‑miR199a‑5p mediated inhibition of EMT by negatively regulating Snail1 protein expression. Therefore, AB209371 silencing in combination with hsa‑miR199a‑5p expression may serve as an effective means to inhibit EMT in HCC cells. The present study also revealed that hsa‑miR199a‑5p/Snail1 exhibits a dominant regulatory effect in the EMT of HCC cells via a Snail1 recovery experiment. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, the present study confirmed for the first time that the high expression of AB209371 is favorable for the EMT in HCC cells and may be a direct cause of hsa‑miR199a‑5p inactivation (an HCC metastasis suppressor). Additionally, AB209371 silencing combined with hsa‑miR199a‑5p overexpression may be an effective means to inhibit the metastasis of HCC and the EMT of HCC cells.",Oncol.

Current glioblastoma treatment strategies use surgery followed by chemotherapy with temozolomide. Despite this, numerous glioblastoma cases develop resistance to temozolomide treatments, resulting in a poor prognosis for the patients. Novel approaches are being investigated, including the inhibition of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), an enzyme that deacetylates α‑tubulin, and whose overexpression in glioblastoma is associated with the loss of primary cilia. The aim of the present study was to treat glioblastoma cells with a selective HDAC6 inhibitor, tubastatin A, to determine if the malignant phenotype may be reverted. The results demonstrated a notable increase in acetylated α‑tubulin levels in treated cells, which associated with downregulation of the sonic hedgehog pathway, and may hypothetically promote ciliogenesis in those cells. Treatment with tubastatin A also reduced glioblastoma clonogenicity and migration capacities, and accelerated temozolomide‑induced apoptosis.

30864702,Mesenchymal stem cell‑derived extracellular vesicles promote the in vitro proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells through the activation of the ERK pathway.,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been demonstrated to be involved in tumor progression and the modulation of the tumor microenvironment, partly through their secretome. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membranous nanovesicles secreted by multiple types of cells and have been demonstrated to mediate intercellular communication in both physiological and pathological conditions. However, numerous questions still remain regarding the underlying mechanisms and functional consequences of these interactions. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell‑derived EVs (hUC‑MSC‑EVs) on the proliferation, migration and invasion of human breast cancer cells. We successfully generated and identified hUC‑MSCs and hUC‑MSC‑EVs which were used in this study. The results revealed that treatment of the MDA‑MB‑231 and MCF‑7 human breast cancer cells with medium containing hUC‑MSC‑EVs significantly enhanced the proliferation, migration and invasion of the cells in vitro. Treatment of the cells with medium containing hUC‑MSC‑EVs also reduced E‑cadherin expression and increased N‑cadherin expression, thus promoting the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) of the breast cancer cells. Treatment of the breast cancer cells with extracellular signal‑regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor prior to the interaction with hUC‑MSC‑EVs significantly reversed the enhanced proliferation, migration and invasion, as well as the EMT of the breast cancer cells induced by the hUC‑MSC‑EVs. On the whole, these data indicate that hUC‑MSC‑EVs promote the invasive and migratory potential of breast cancer cells through the induction of EMT via the ERK pathway, leading to malignant tumor progression and metastasis. Taken together, the findings of this study suggest that targeting pathways to reverse EMT may lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches with which to combat breast cancer.",Int. J.

30864678,URG11 promotes proliferation and induced apoptosis of LNCaP cells.,"von Willebrand factor C and EGF domain‑containing protein (URG11), a cell growth regulator, is involved in the progression of a variety of types of cancer, including prostate cancer (Pca). However, the functions of the URG11 gene in Pca cells require in‑depth investigation. The mRNA and protein levels of URG11 were measured by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) and western blot analysis. Cell Counting kit‑8 (CCK‑8), wound‑healing and Transwell assays were used to detect cell viability, migration and invasion, respectively. Apoptosis and cell cycle analyses were performed using flow cytometry. The mRNA and protein expression levels of epithelial (E)‑cadherin, vimentin, α‑smooth muscle actin (α‑SMA), cyclin D1 and MYC proto‑oncogene protein (c‑Myc) were analyzed by RT‑qPCR and western blot analysis. In the present study, the mRNA and protein levels of URG11 were markedly upregulated in Pca cell lines compared with those in the normal prostate epithelial cell line. With functional experiments, the cell viability, migration and invasion of Pca cells were markedly promoted by URG11 overexpression. The cell cycle was effectively induced by URG11 and apoptosis was inhibited by the overexpression of URG11. Concomitantly, the epithelial marker E‑cadherin was downregulated, and the mesenchymal markers vimentin and α‑SMA were upregulated following URG11 overexpression. By contrast, genetic knockout of URG11 elicited the opposite effects. The present study also identified that the downstream effector genes of the Wnt/β‑catenin signal pathway, cyclin D1 and c‑Myc, were increased following the overexpression of endogenous URG11, which are known to regulate cell proliferation. In addition, the Wnt/β‑catenin inhibitor FH535 ameliorated the promotive effects of URG11 on LNCaP cells viability, migration and invasion, and the Wnt/β‑catenin agonist LiCl reversed the inhibitory effects of siURG11 in LNCaP cells on cell viability, migration and invasion. The present study demonstrated that URG11 served an oncogenic role in the development of Pca cells and provided evidence that URG11 has potential as a novel therapeutic target in Pca.",Int. J. Mol.

30856168,Modeling differentiation-state transitions linked to therapeutic escape in triple-negative breast cancer.,"Drug resistance in breast cancer cell populations has been shown to arise through phenotypic transition of cancer cells to a drug-tolerant state, for example through epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition or transition to a cancer stem cell state. However, many breast tumors are a heterogeneous mixture of cell types with numerous epigenetic states in addition to stem-like and mesenchymal phenotypes, and the dynamic behavior of this heterogeneous mixture in response to drug treatment is not well-understood. Recently, we showed that plasticity between differentiation states, as identified with intracellular markers such as cytokeratins, is linked to resistance to specific targeted therapeutics. Understanding the dynamics of differentiation-state transitions in this context could facilitate the development of more effective treatments for cancers that exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity. In this work, we develop computational models of a drug-treated, phenotypically heterogeneous triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line to elucidate the feasibility of differentiation-state transition as a mechanism for therapeutic escape in this tumor subtype. Specifically, we use modeling to predict the changes in differentiation-state transitions that underlie specific therapy-induced changes in differentiation-state marker expression that we recently observed in the HCC1143 cell line. We report several statistically significant therapy-induced changes in transition rates between basal, luminal, mesenchymal, and non-basal/non-luminal/non-mesenchymal differentiation states in HCC1143 cell populations. Moreover, we validate model predictions on cell division and cell death empirically, and we test our models on an independent data set. Overall, we demonstrate that changes in differentiation-state transition rates induced by targeted therapy can provoke distinct differentiation-state aggregations of drug-resistant cells, which may be fundamental to the design of improved therapeutic regimens for cancers with phenotypic heterogeneity.",PLoS Comput.

30855625,A switchable NO-releasing nanomedicine for enhanced cancer therapy and inhibition of metastasis.,"Clinical chemotherapy for cancer is limited by the physiological barrier of tumors, resulting in low drug delivery to tumors, poor efficacy of drugs and inability to block tumor metastasis. Here we developed an intelligent switchable nitric oxide (NO)-releasing nanoparticle, IPH-NO, which loads a photosensitizer (IR780) and the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel (PTX) into NO donor-S-nitrosated human serum albumin (HSA-NO). NO exhibits two effects based on its concentration: enhancement of chemotherapy by increasing the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect at low concentrations and direct killing of cancer cells at high concentrations. IPH-NO can slowly release NO in the presence of glutathione to boost tumor vascular permeability and improve drug accumulation. Near-infrared light irradiation was utilized to induce a quick release of NO that can directly kill cancer cells at high concentrations. This combination of phototherapy and NO gas therapy activated by NIR together with chemotherapy showed significant effects in tumor inhibition. Furthermore, IPH-NO blocked tumor metastasis by inhibiting epithelial mesenchymal transition. PH-NO provides a novel strategy to control NO release at tumor site for drug accumulation and combination therapies, consequently potentiating the anticancer efficacy and inhibiting tumor metastasis.",Nanoscale,2019,"['Xu Y', 'Ren H', 'Liu J', 'Wang Y', 'Meng Z', 'He Z', 'Miao W', 'Chen G', 'Li X']",

A secondary end-point was to conduct a preliminary clinical and pathological investigation into the possible role of β-arrestin-1 in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), identified by testing for E-cadherin, Zeb1, and Zeb2 expression, in the setting of LSCC.
METHODS: The expression of β-arrestin-1, E-cadherin, zeb1, and zeb2 was ascertained in 20 consecutive LSCCs.
RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed no significant associations between β-arrestin-1 and EMT (based on the expression of E-cadherin, Zeb1, and Zeb2). The combined effect of nicotine and β-arrestin-1 was significantly associated with a shorter disease-free survival ( P=0.01) in our series of LSCC. This latter result was also confirmed in an independent, publicly available LSCC cohort ( P=0.047).
CONCLUSIONS: Further investigations on larger series (ideally in prospective settings) are needed before we can consider closer follow-up protocols and/or more aggressive treatments for patients with LSCC and a combination of nicotine exposure and β-arrestin-1 positivity in tumor cells at the time of their diagnosis.

30850186,New Advances of Heparanase and Heparanase-2 in Human Diseases.,"As we all know, heparanase plays an important role in human diseases. As a kind of endo-β-glucuronidase, heparanase is the known only enzyme in mammals which could degrade heparan sulfate(HS) specifically. HS is a vital component of extracellular matrix(ECM). Heparanase takes effect by cleaving theβ(1,4)-glycosidic between glucosamine residue and glucuronic acid of HS. This cleavage will cause ECM remodelling and HS-linked biological molecules release, including cytokines, growth factors and a lot of biological molecules regulating various pathological activities. Experiments already proved that heparanase gene over-expresses in cancers of gastrointestinal tract, esophagus, breast and so on. Various studies have demonstrated the heparanase's pro-metastatic function and the reduced survival rate of patients could be indicated by high heparanase levels. Besides, pathological processes including procoagulant activities, preeclamptic placentas and inflammation are all verified to be associated with heparanase activity. In recent years, many functions other than pro-tumor effect was found in heparanase and worldwide researchers conducted varieties of experiments to identify the new function of this significant enzyme. Also, these newly-found functions are closely connected to certain cellular activities, for example epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). It has already been demonstrated that EMT is related to some clinical disorders, like renal diseases. Given that heparanase is the only enzyme capable of this function, it could be concluded that heparanase would be a potential and valuable therapy target. This mini-review aims to retrospect literatures about heparanase published in 2017 and 2018 and provide a direction for therapy methods targeting heparanase.",Arch. Med.

30845991,GSK3β regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cell properties in triple-negative breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), which lack receptors for estrogen, progesterone, and amplification of epidermal growth factor receptor 2, are highly aggressive. Consequently, patients diagnosed with TNBCs have reduced overall and disease-free survival rates compared to patients with other subtypes of breast cancer. TNBCs are characterized by the presence of cancer cells with mesenchymal properties, indicating that the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a major role in the progression of this disease. The EMT program has also been implicated in chemoresistance, tumor recurrence, and induction of cancer stem cell (CSC) properties. Currently, there are no targeted therapies for TNBC, and hence, it is critical to identify the novel targets to treat TNBC.
METHODS: A library of compounds was screened for their ability to inhibit EMT in cells with mesenchymal phenotype as assessed using the previously described Z-cad reporters. Of the several drugs tested, GSK3β inhibitors were identified as EMT inhibitors. The effects of GSK3β inhibitors on the properties of TNBC cells with a mesenchymal phenotype were assessed using qRT-PCR, flow cytometry, western blot, mammosphere, and migration and cell viability assays. Publicly available datasets also were analyzed to examine if the expression of GSK3β correlates with the overall survival of breast cancer patients.
RESULTS: We identified a GSK3β inhibitor, BIO, in a drug screen as one of the most potent inhibitors of EMT. BIO and two other GSK3β inhibitors, TWS119 and LiCl, also decreased the expression of mesenchymal markers in several different cell lines with a mesenchymal phenotype. Further, inhibition of GSK3β reduced EMT-related migratory properties of cells with mesenchymal properties. To determine if GSK3β inhibitors target mesenchymal-like cells by affecting the CSC population, we employed mammosphere assays and profiled the stem cell-related cell surface marker CD44+/24- in cells after exposure to GSK3β inhibitors. We found that GSK3β inhibitors indeed decreased the CSC properties of cell types with mesenchymal properties. We treated cells with epithelial and mesenchymal properties with GSK3β inhibitors and found that GSK3β inhibitors selectively kill cells with mesenchymal attributes while sparing cells with epithelial properties. We analyzed patient data to identify genes predictive of poor clinical outcome that could serve as novel therapeutic targets for TNBC. The Wnt signaling pathway is critical to EMT, but among the various factors known to be involved in Wnt signaling, only the higher expression of GSK3β correlated with poorer overall patient survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data demonstrate that GSK3β is a potential target for TNBCs and suggest that GSK3β inhibitors could serve as selective inhibitors of EMT and CSC properties for the treatment of a subset of aggressive TNBC. GSK3β inhibitors should be tested for use in combination with standard-of-care drugs in preclinical TNBC models.",Breast Cancer Res.,2019,"['Vijay GV', 'Zhao N', 'Den Hollander P', 'Toneff MJ', 'Joseph R', 'Pietila M', 'Taube JH', 'Sarkar TR', 'Ramirez-Pena E', 'Werden SJ', 'Shariati M', 'Gao R', 'Sobieski M', 'Stephan CC', 'Sphyris N', 'Miura N', 'Davies P', 'Chang JT', 'Soundararajan R', 'Rosen JM', 'Mani SA']",

Emerging evidence suggests that HSF1 activation in stromal cells is closely related to poor patient prognosis. However, the role of HSF1 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains elusive. We aimed to investigate the function of HSF1 in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and in tumor development. In the present study, we found that HSF1 was highly expressed in both CAFs and tumor cells, and was significantly correlated with poor prognosis and overall survival. Moreover, HSF1 overexpression in CAFs resulted in a fibroblast-like phenotype of Cal27 cells, induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and promoted proliferation, migration and invasion in Cal27 cells. HSF1 knockdown attenuated features of CAFs and reduced EMT, proliferation, migration and invasion in Cal27 cells. Furthermore, HSF1 in CAFs promoted tumor growth in nude mice. Taken together, these data suggest that HSF1 expression in CAFs drive OSCC progression, and could serve as an independent prognostic marker of patients with OSCC.

30835040,Difference of TGF-β/Smads signaling pathway in epithelial-mesenchymal transition of normal colonic epithelial cells induced by tumor-associated fibroblasts and colon cancer cells.,"Tumor microenvironment (TME) crucially functions in tumor initiation and progression. Stroma-tumor interactions and cellular transdifferentiation are the prerequisite for tumor formation. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), a major cytokine secreted by tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAFs) and cancer cells, is a crucial player involving cell transdifferentiation. Therefore, we hypothesized that these TAFs and cancer cells also affect normal colon epithelium. In our study, we found for the first time that colon cancer cells HCT116 and TAF-like CCD-18Co cells induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like transdifferentiation in colon epithelial cells HCoEpiCs, with enhanced migratio. Dysfunction of TGF-β/Smads signal was also observed in the EMT-transformed HCoEpiCs. We wondered whether these phenomena were regulated by TGF-β/Smads signaling pathway. A TGFβ receptor kinase I (TβRI) inhibitor LY364947 was used. We found that the EMT induced by the HCT116- and CCD-18Co-derived CM was suppressed by the LY364947. Besides, different expression profiles for the components of TGF-β/Smads pathway were found in the EMT-like HCoEpiCs, but high expression of p-Smad2/3 and Smad4 was the common feature.

30834573,Junctional adhesion molecule-A is down-regulated in anaplastic thyroid carcinomas and reduces cancer cell aggressiveness by modulating p53 and GSK3 α/β pathways.,"Junctional adhesion molecule A (JAM-A) is a transmembrane protein that contributes to different biological process, including the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Through an EMT profiler array, we explored the molecular players associated with human thyroid cancer progression and identified JAM-A as one of the genes mostly deregulated. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry analyses showed that downregulation of JAM-A occurred in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) compared with normal thyroid (NT) and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) tissues and correlated with extrathyroid infiltration, tumor size, and ATC histotype. In ATC cell lines, JAM-A restoration suppressed malignant hallmarks of transformation including cell proliferation, motility, and transendothelial migration. Accordingly, knockdown of JAM-A enhanced thyroid cancer cell proliferation and motility in PTC cells. Through the proteome profiler human phospho-kinase array, we demonstrated that higher expression of JAM-A was associated with a significant increased level of phosphorylation of p53 and GSK3 α/β proteins. In conclusion, our findings highlight a novel role of JAM-A in thyroid cancer progression and suggest that JAM-A restoration could have potential clinical relevance in thyroid cancer treatment.",Mol.

30834518,Deregulated GATA6 modulates stem cell-like properties and metabolic phenotype in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Accumulating evidence illustrates the significance of cell plasticity in the molecular biology of liver cancer. Reprogramming of mature parenchymal cells to a less differentiated state by key molecular targets contributes to the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hereby, we investigated the role of GATA6, a transcription factor implicated in hepatocyte lineage specification, in HCC. Our results demonstrated a lower expression of GATA6 in HCC tissues compared to the corresponding nontumoral liver tissues. Moreover, GATA6 underexpression, as observed in about 50% cases in our clinical cohort, was associated with a poorer degree of tumor cell differentiation and worse disease-free survival outcome. In vitro, silencing of GATA6 in HCC cells augmented cell migration and invasion abilities of HCC cells by activating epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Self-renewal was also enhanced in vitro. Consistently, in vivo tumorigenicity and self-renewal was promoted upon GATA6 knockdown. Notably, suppression of GATA6 converts HCC cells to a metabolic phenotype recapitulating stem-cell state. Expression of glycolytic markers was elevated in GATA6-knockdown clones accompanied by increased glucose uptake; while overexpression of GATA6 resulted in opposite effects. Further to this, we identified that GATA6 bound to the promoter region of PKM gene and regulated PKM2 transcription. Taken together, downregulation of GATA6 directs HCC cells to glycolytic metabolism and fosters tumorigenicity, self-renewal and metastasis. GATA6 is a transcriptional regulator and a genetic switch that converts the phenotypic reprogramming of HCC cells. It is a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for liver cancer.",Int. J. Cancer,2019,"['Tan HW', 'Leung CO', 'Chan KK', 'Ho DW', 'Leung MS', 'Wong CM', 'Ng IO', 'Lo RC']",
30833799,Dbx2 exhibits a tumor-promoting function in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines via regulating Shh-Gli1 signaling.,"BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide. HCC patients suffer from a high mortality-to-incidence ratio and low cure rate since we still have no specific and effective treatment. Although tremendous advances have been made in the investigation of HCC, the specific mechanisms of the progression of this disease are still only partially established. Hence, more research is needed to elucidate the underlying potential mechanisms to develop effective strategies for HCC.
AIM: To determine the role of developing brain homeobox 2 (Dbx2) gene in promoting the development of HCC.
METHODS: Dbx2 expression in clinical specimens and HCC cell lines was detected by Western blot (WB) and immunohistochemistry. Gain and loss of Dbx2 function assays were performed 
RESULTS: Compared to matched adjacent non-tumorous tissues, Dbx2 was overexpressed in 5 HCC cell lines and 76 surgically resected HCC tissues. Dbx2 overexpression was correlated with large tumor size. Both gain and loss of function assays indicated that Dbx2 promoted HCC cell proliferation by facilitating the transition from G1 to S phase, attenuating apoptosis and promoted HCC proliferation, migration, and invasion 
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that Dbx2 is significantly upregulated in HCC tissues and plays significant roles in proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells by activating the Shh pathway.",World J.

30832473,Glycyrrhizin Attenuates the Process of Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition by Modulating HMGB1 Initiated Novel Signaling Pathway in Prostate Cancer Cells.,"High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is upregulated in nearly every tumor type. Importantly, clinical evidence also proposed that HMGB1 is particularly increased in metastatic prostate cancer patients. Besides, a growing number of studies highlighted that HMGB1 could be a successful therapeutic target for prostate cancer patients. Glycyrrhizin is a novel pharmacological inhibitor of HMGB1 that may repress prostate cancer metastasis. This research was aimed to investigate the effect of glycyrrhizin on inhibition of HMGB1-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key step of tumor metastasis, in prostate cancer cells. In this study, HMGB1 knock-downed DU145 prostate cancer cells were used. Silencing the HMGB1 gene expression triggered a change of cell morphology to a more epithelial-like shape, which was accompanied by a reduction of Cdc42/GSK-3β/Snail and induction of E-cadherin levels estimated by immunoblotting. Furthermore, HMGB1 facilitated cell migration and invasion via downstream signaling, whereas HMGB1 targeting by 10 mM ethyl pyruvate effectively inhibited EMT characteristics. Interestingly, cell migration capacity induced by HMGB1 in DU145 cells was abolished in a dose-dependent effect of 25-200 μM glycyrrhizin treatment. In conclusion, glycyrrhizin successfully inhibited HMGB1-induced EMT phenomenon, which suggested that glycyrrhizin may serves as a therapeutic agent for metastatic prostate cancer.",J. Agric.

30832318,ROR1 Expression and Its Functional Significance in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells.,"BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common and deadly cancer; however, very little improvement has been made towards its diagnosis and prognosis. The expression and functional contribution of the receptor tyrosine kinase ROR1 have not been investigated in HCC before. Hence, we investigated the expression of ROR1 in HCC cells and assessed its involvement in hepatocarcinogenesis.
METHODS: Recombinant bacterial ROR1 protein was used as an immunogen to generate ROR1 monoclonal antibodies. 
RESULTS: New ROR1 antibodies specifically detected endogenous ROR1 protein in human and mouse HCC cell lines. ROR1-knockdown resulted in decreased proliferation and migration but enhanced resistance to apoptosis and anoikis. The observed chemotherapy-resistant phenotype of ROR1-knockdown cells was due to enhanced drug efflux and increased expression of multi-drug resistance genes.
CONCLUSIONS: ROR1 is expressed in HCC and contributes to disease development by interfering with multiple pathways. Acquired ROR1 expression may have diagnostic and prognostic value in HCC.",Cells,2019,"['Cetin M', 'Odabas G', 'Douglas LR', 'Duriez PJ', 'Balcik-Ercin P', 'Yalim-Camci I', 'Sayan AE', 'Yagci T']",
30831320,Paracrine Induction of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Between Colorectal Cancer Cells and its Suppression by a p53/miR-192/215/NID1 Axis.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Intratumor heterogeneity is a common feature of colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we analyzed whether mesenchymal-like CRC cells promote the progression of epithelial-like CRC cells via paracrine mechanisms.
METHODS: Six CRC cell lines that show an epithelial phenotype were treated with conditioned media (CM) from CRC cell lines that show a mesenchymal phenotype, and effects on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration, invasion, and chemoresistance were determined. Secreted factors potentially mediating these effects were identified by using cytokine arrays. Associations of these factors with tumor progression and patient survival were determined.
RESULTS: CM obtained from mesenchymal-like CRC cells induced EMT associated with increased migration, invasion, and chemoresistance in epithelial-like CRC cell lines. Notably, activation of p53 in mesenchymal-like CRC cells prevented these effects of CM. Increased concentrations of several cytokines were identified in CM from mesenchymal-like CRC cell lines and a subset of these cytokines showed repression by p53. The down-regulation of nidogen-1 (NID1) was particularly significant and was owing to p53-mediated induction of microRNA-192 and microRNA-215, which directly target the NID1 messenger RNA. NID1 was found to be required and sufficient for inducing EMT, invasion, and migration in epithelial-like CRC cells. In primary CRCs, increased NID1 expression was associated with p53 mutation and microRNA-192/215 down-regulation. Importantly, increased NID1 expression in CRCs correlated with enhanced tumor progression and poor patient survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results show that CRC cells promote tumor progression via secreting NID1, which induces EMT in neighboring tumor cells. Importantly, the interference of p53 with this paracrine signaling between tumor cells may critically contribute to tumor suppression.",Cell Mol Gastroenterol Hepatol,2019,"['Rokavec M', 'Bouznad N', 'Hermeking H']",

Central to the characteristic stem-like phenotype of CSCs in cancer is the activity of the SOX2 transcription factor whose upregulation has been associated with enrichment of many oncogenes. This study outlines the fabrication of a lipoplex of SOX2 small interfering RNA (CL-siSOX2) for targeted treatment of SOX2-enriched, CSC-derived orthotopic and xenograft lung tumors in CB-17 SCID mice. CL-siSOX2 induced tumor contraction in cisplatin-naïve and cisplatin-treated groups by 85% and 94% respectively. Reduction in tumor weight and volume following treatment with CL-siSOX2 was associated with reduced protein expression of SOX2 and markers of tumor initiation, inflammation, invasion and metastasis in mice tumor xenografts. In addition, histological staining of lung tumor sections showed reduction in SOX2 expression was associated with inhibition markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.",Nanomedicine,2019,"['Andey T', 'Bora-Singhal N', 'Chellappan SP', 'Singh M']",

In this study we explored the clinical relevance and biological function of Pol ι in breast cancer.
METHODS: qRT-PCR was used to determine the expression levels of Pol ι in 31 breast cancer tissues. Then the stable overexpression of Pol ι and knockdown of Pol ι breast cancer cell lines were constructed. Wound-healing assay and transwell assay were performed to evaluate cell migratory and invasiveness, respectively. Signaling pathway was analyzed by western blot.
RESULTS: The expression levels of Pol ι is overexpressed in breast cancer tissues and significantly higher in breast cancer tissues with lymph node metastasis compared to those without lymph node metastasis. Elevated Pol ι expression promoted migratory and invasiveness of breast cancer cells. Signaling pathway analysis indicated EGFR-ERK cascade works as a mediator of Pol ι-induced EMT of breast cancer cells.

30829316,Regulation of Proliferation and Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) of Gastric Cancer by ZEB1 via Modulating Wnt5a and Related Mechanisms.,"BACKGROUND As a member of the zinc-finger E-box binding protein (ZEB) family, ZEB1 can modulate onset and progression of various tumors, but its regulatory effect or mechanism in GC has not been defined. MATERIAL AND METHODS GC tumor tissues and adjacent tissues were collected from GC patients across different TNM stages. Real-time PCR was used to measure ZEB1 expression to analyze its correlation with pathological features of tumors. Cultured GC cell lines SGC-7901 and MGC-803 were randomly assigned into control group, scramble group, and ZEB1 siRNA group. Real-time PCR was employed to analyze ZEB1 expression, and MTT approach was used to measure cell proliferation. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry. Wound healing assay was used to detect its effect on cell migration. Expression of E-cadherin and Vimentin involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was measured by Western blot analysis, along with Wnt5a proteins. RESULTS GC tissues had upregulation of ZEB1 (P<0.05 compared to adjacent tissues), whose expression level was correlated with differentiation grade, lymph node metastasis, and tumor pathological stage (P<0.05). Transfection of ZEB1 siRNA into SGC-7901 or MGC-803 cells can suppress ZEB1 expression, inhibit tumor cell proliferation, enhance apoptosis, and inhibit cell migration. Transfected GC cells had higher E-cadherin expression and decreased Vimentin expression or Wnt5a expression (P<0.05 compared to the control group). CONCLUSIONS ZEB1 expression is increased in GC tumor tissues and is associated with pathological features. The downregulation of ZEB1 can facilitate cell apoptosis via mediating Wnt5a, further suppressing GC cell proliferation and migration, and reducing EMT occurrence.",Med. Sci.

30828076,Fucoidan Promotes Apoptosis and Inhibits EMT of Breast Cancer Cells.,"Fucoidan is an active component of seaweed, and could inhibit proliferation and induce apoptotic cell death in several tumor cells. However, the function of fucoidan in breast cancer is largely unknown. In the present study, we evaluated the anti-cancer potential of fucoidan in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to receive fucoidan (200 or 400 mg/kg·body weight per day) or normal saline via gastric gavage for 3 consecutive days. Serum samples were prepared from these rats, and used for subsequent experiments to examine the potential effects in MCF-7 cells. Cell viability was determined using a 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Apoptosis was examined with Hoechst33258 staining and flow cytometry. Cell migration and invasion were measured by wound scratch assay and Transwell assay, respectively. Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to examine the expression of secretory E-cadherin and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Conditioned serum from fucoidan-treated rats significantly suppressed cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis. Cell migration and invasion were also significantly decreased. Observed effects of conditioned serum were associated with upregulation of E-cadherin and downregulation of MMP-9. Conditioned serum of rats treated with fucoidan could inhibit the proliferation and promote apoptosis of MCF-7 cells. Cell invasion and migration were inhibited, possibly via decreased epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Fucoidan may be a promising therapeutic agent for human breast cancers.",Biol.

30826970,SNHG6 is upregulated in primary breast cancers and promotes cell cycle progression in breast cancer-derived cell lines.,"BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are known as RNAs that do not encode proteins and that are more than 200 nucleotides in size. Previously, it has been found that LncRNAs play crucial roles in normal cellular processes, including proliferation and apoptosis. A growing body of evidence suggests that lncRNAs may also play regulatory roles in the initiation, progression and metastasis of various malignancies, including breast cancer. SNHG6 is a lncRNA that has previously been found to contribute to the initiation and progression of hepatocellular and gastric carcinomas. In this study, the clinical significance of SNHG6 expression in breast cancer was investigated.
METHODS: SNHG6 expression in primary breast cancer tissues was assessed using RT-qPCR. The functional role of SNHG6 was investigated using RNAi-mediated silencing and exogenous overexpression in breast cancer-derived cells. MTT, colony formation, cell cycle, apoptosis and senescence assays were used to determine the impact of SNHG6 expression on breast cancer-derived cells. The effect of SNHG6 on the migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of breast cancer-derived cells was determined using scratch wound healing and immunofluorescence assays, respectively.
RESULTS: We found that the expression of SNHG6 was significantly upregulated in primary high-grade and progesterone receptor (PR)-positive breast tumours. Additional siRNA-based experiments revealed that SNHG6 silencing led to G1 cell cycle arrest in SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer-derived cells. Moreover, we found that SNHG6 silencing led to suppressed breast cancer cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis and senescence. Our data also indicate that SNHG6 may contribute to the migration and EMT of breast cancer cells.

However, whether targeting the functional interplay between Ero1α and PDI could be a new approach for cancer therapy remains unknown.
METHODS: We performed wound healing assays, transwell migration and invasion assays and xenograft assays to assess cell migration, invasion and tumorigenesis; gel filtration chromatography, oxygen consumption assay and in cells folding assays were used to detect Ero1α-PDI interaction and Ero1α oxidase activity.
FINDINGS: Here, we report that elevated expression of Ero1α is correlated with poor prognosis in human cervical cancer. Knockout of ERO1A decreases the growth, migration and tumorigenesis of cervical cancer cells, through downregulation of the H

30825051,Activation of EMT in colorectal cancer by MTDH/NF-κB p65 pathway.,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) leads to tumor dissemination and metastasis. Metadherin (MTDH) is an oncogene that plays an important role in metastasis regulation. This study tries to investigate the effect of MTDH gene up-regulation on the activation of EMT in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells and identify the role of NF-κB p65. The CaCO2 cells were divided into three groups: one control group of cultured CaCO2 cells (C1), and two groups of CaCO2 cells co-transfected using human MTDH expression plasmid with either siRNA targeting human NF-κB p65 or its negative control (C2 and C3 respectively). The gene modification was confirmed by qPCR and the effect of gene modification on CRC aggravation was studied. MTDH up-regulation significantly promoted CRC cell proliferation, activated anaerobic respiration (glucose consumption and lactate production), and increased gene expression of multidrug resistance gene (MDR1), Snail transcription factor and NF-κB p65, but decreased the gene expression of E-cadherin. Moreover, MTDH up-regulation led to a significant increase in the acquisition of surface markers of CRC stem cells. Interference with NF-κB p65 gene expression reversed the action of MTDH gene up-regulation on MDR1 and E-cadherin gene expression and anaerobic respiration. Moreover, NF-κB p65 interference significantly decreased MTDH-induced cell proliferation and acquisition of surface markers of CRC stem cells but didn't affect the Snail transcription factor. MTDH-dependent EMT in CRC is activated via NF-κB p65 and is mediated by up-regulation of Snail. These results identify a pathway by which MTDH regulates NF-κB p65 induced EMT during CRC cell metastasis.",Mol. Cell. Biochem.,2019,"['El-Ashmawy NE', 'El-Zamarany EA', 'Khedr EG', 'Abo-Saif MA']",

ERα has been identified to promote the growth of primary breast cancer, however, it can also antagonize signaling pathways that lead to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), including transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling. miRNA alteration or dysfunction is involved in cancer development and progression. Although miR-1271 has identified as a tumor suppressor in various cancers, the role of miR-1271 in breast cancer is still limited.
METHODS: The effect of miR-1271 on breast cancer progression was investigated both in vitro and in vivo. The EMT-related protein expression levels and localization were analyzed by western blotting and immunofluorescence, respectively. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and dual-luciferase reporter assays were used to validate the regulation of ERα-miR-1271-SNAI2 feedback loop.
RESULTS: miR-1271 suppresses breast cancer progression and EMT phenotype both in vitro and in vivo by targeting SNAI2. Estrogen reverses TGF-β-induced EMT in a miR-1271 dependent manner. Furthermore, ERα transactivates the miR-1271 expression and is also transcriptionally repressed by SNAI2.

30820716,Insufficient radiofrequency ablation promotes the metastasis of residual hepatocellular carcinoma cells via upregulating flotillin proteins.,"PURPOSE: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy has proven to be effective and feasible for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, rapid progression of residual tumor cells after RFA has been confirmed, but the molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon are poorly understood. This study evaluated the effect of the lipid raft proteins known as flotillins on the invasive and metastatic potential of residual HCC.
METHODS: The human HCC cell line HCCLM3 was used to establish insufficient RFA models in vivo and in vitro. Changes in cellular morphology, soft agar colony formation, motility, metastasis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers after insufficient RFA intervention in vitro and in vivo were detected by real-time PCR, western blotting, immunohistochemistry and transwell assays.
RESULTS: The results showed that flotillin-1 and flotillin-2 expression were upregulated in HCCLM3 cells following 45 °C heat treatment and in residual HCCLM3 xenografts cells after insufficient RFA. Knocking down flotillin-1 or flotillin-2 in HCCLM3 cells by shRNA significantly lowered insufficient RFA-induced tumor growth, EMT changes, and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, mechanism studies indicated that flotillins altered the EMT status and metastatic potential of heat-treated HCCLM3 cells by activating the Akt/Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings present new evidence that flotillins play a key role in the aggressive behaviors of residual cancer cells after insufficient RFA and provide new insights into the regulatory mechanism of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.",J.

30820013,The Significance of Circulating Tumour Cells in the Clinic.,"BACKGROUND: Despite the hype about circulating tumour cells (CTCs) in the early 2000s and their potential in the diagnosis of metastasis, in recent years, the hope for personalised cancer management relies more on circulating tumour (ct)DNA that has entered the clinic in a much more efficient way. So far, approved methods for CTCs in the clinic only provide the counting of CTCs, which enables monitoring of the progression of metastatic breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer patients with therapy. Approved methods for ctDNA facilitate the analysis of specific mutations in lung cancer, thereby providing indications for potentially successful treatments. This situation inclined the balance towards molecular analysis in liquid biopsy, leveraged by new technologies and companies providing broader mutation and gene expression analysis towards the early diagnosis of cancer.
STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a search for the studies published to date that provide details about the significance of CTCs in the clinic.
RESULTS: Many studies and clinical trials have demonstrated the potential of CTCs in patient screening, early diagnosis, therapy resistance, and patient prognosis.

30819230,TRPM7 promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in ovarian cancer through the calcium-related PI3K / AKT oncogenic signaling.,"BACKGROUND: The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is crucial for metastasis and positively regulated by calcium-related signaling. The melastatin-related transient receptor potential 7 (TRPM7) regulates a non-selective cation channel and promotes cancer metastasis. However, the mechanisms underlying the action of TRPM7 in ovarian cancer are unclear.
METHODS: The expression of TRPM7 and EMT markers (Vimentin, N-cadherin, Twist and E-cadherin) in ovarian cancer samples was detected. TRPM7was knockdown by shRNA in Ovarian cancer cell lines to examine calcium [Ca2+]i, EMT markers and PI3K/AKT markers. Various cellular assays, such as invasion and migration, were performed in vitro, and further confirmed in vivo.
RESULTS: TRPM7 expression is negatively correlated with E-cadherin, but positively with N-cadherin, Vimentin and Twist expression in ovarian cancer samples. TRPM7 depletion inhibited the migration and invasion in SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells. In addition, TRPM7 silencing decreased the lung metastasis of SKOV3 tumors and prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Similar to that of TRPM7 silencing, treatment with MK886, a potent 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor to reduce TRPM7 expression, and/or BAPTA-AM, an intracellular calcium chelator, significantly mitigated the Epidermal growth factor (EGF) or Insulin-like growth factors (IGF)-stimulated migration, invasion, and the EMT in ovarian cancer cells by decreasing the levels of intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i. Furthermore, treatment with LY2904002, a PI3K inhibitor, also inhibited the migration, invasion, and treatment with both LY2904002 and BAPTA-AM further enhanced their inhibition in ovarian cancer cells. Moreover, treatment with BAPTA-AM mitigated the IGF-stimulated migration, invasion, particularly in TRPM7-silenced ovarian cancer cells. Finally, TRPM7 silencing attenuated the PI3K/AKT activation, which was enhanced by BAPTA-AM, MK886 or LY2904002 treatment in ovarian cancer cells.
CONCLUSIONS: TRPM7 silencing inhibited the EMT and metastasis of ovarian cancer by attenuating the calcium-related PI3k/AKT activation.

30818851,Cathepsin B Is Upregulated and Mediates ECM Degradation in Colon Adenocarcinoma HT29 Cells Overexpressing Snail.,"During tumor development and ongoing metastasis the acquisition of mesenchymal cell traits by epithelial carcinoma cells is achieved through a programmed phenotypic shift called the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, EMT. EMT contributes to increased cancer cell motility and invasiveness mainly through invadosomes, the adhesion structures that accompany the mesenchymal migration. The invadosomes and their associated proteases restrict protease activity to areas of the cell in direct contact with the ECM, thus precisely controlling cell invasion. Our data prove that Snail-overexpressing HT-29 cells that imitate the phenotype of colon cancer cells in the early stage of the EMT showed an increase in the expression and pericellular activity of cathepsin B.

Cell adhesion molecules (CADMs) immunoglobulin super family is involved in the maintenance of cell adhesion, polarity and tumor suppression. However, the role and mechanisms of CADM2 in human glioma have yet to be elucidated. Therefore, the present study evaluated the expression level of CADM2 and demonstrated that CADM2 was markedly downregulated in human glioma tissues compared with normal brain tissue and glioma cell lines, and the CADM2 expression level was significantly decreased in high‑grade glioma tissues. Overexpression of CADM2 inhibited the proliferation of glioma cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. CADM2 also inhibited the migration and invasion of U87 and U251 cells.

30816545,Upregulation and hypomethylation of lncRNA AFAP1‑AS1 predicts a poor prognosis and promotes the migration and invasion of cervical cancer.,"Although lncRNA AFAP1 antisense RNA1 (AFAP1‑AS1) is considered an oncogenic lncRNA, little is known about the role of AFAP1‑AS1 in cervical cancer. In the present study, we found that AFAP1‑AS1 was elevated and hypomethylated in cervical cancer and was associated with a poor prognosis of patients with cervical cancer by analyzing the Cancer RNA‑Seq Nexus (CRN), MethCH and UCSC XENA databases. Subsequently, we knocked AFAP1‑AS1 expression down using siRNAs in cervical cancer cells. Wound healing experiments and matrigel invasion experiments revealed that the downregulation of AFAP1‑AS1 suppressed the migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells. Furthermore, western blot analysis demonstrated that the antitumor effects induced by the silencing of AFAP1‑AS1 were mainly mediated through the regulation of the Rho/Rac signaling pathway and epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT)‑related genes. Taken together, the findings of the present study indicate that the expression level of AFAP1‑AS1 may be involved in the development of cervical cancer. Thus, AFAP1‑AS1 may be a novel prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for patients with cervical cancer.",Oncol.

RCC tissues and adjacent normal tissues were collected from 80 patients with RCC. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the positive expression rate of the LOXL2 protein. The expression levels of LOXL2 in the HK‑2, 786‑O, ACHN, Caki1 and A498 cell lines were detected by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR). The high LOXL2‑expressing 786‑O cells were selected for gene silencing experiments, whereas Caki1 cells, which exhibited low LOXL2 expression, were used for overexpression experiments. RT‑qPCR and western blot analysis were applied to determine the expression of LOXL2, FAK, Src, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)‑9, epithelial (E)‑cadherin, neuronal (N)‑cadherin and vimentin. A MTT assay, a Transwell assay, a wound healing assay and flow cytometry were performed to detect cell proliferation, invasion, migration, cell cycle distribution and apoptosis, respectively. The protein expression rate of LOXL2 in RCC tissues was higher compared with that in adjacent normal tissues. Compared with adjacent normal tissues, the mRNA and protein expression levels of LOXL2, FAK, Src, MMP‑9, N‑cadherin and vimentin and the levels of FAK and Src phosphorylation were increased, while the mRNA and protein expression levels of E‑cadherin were decreased in RCC tissues. Following the transfection of 786‑O cells with small interfering (si) RNA against LOXL2, the mRNA and protein expression levels of FAK, Src, MMP‑9, N‑cadherin and vimentin and the levels of phosphorylated FAK and Src were notably decreased in the si‑LOXL2 and PP2 inhibitor treated groups, while that of E‑cadherin was substantially increased. Additionally, cell proliferation, invasion, migration and the percentage of RCC cells in the G1 phase were reduced, and cell apoptosis was increased. Additionally, Caki1 cells transfected with LOXL2 exhibited an opposite trend. In summary, these results indicate that LOXL2 silencing inhibits the invasion, migration and EMT in RCC cells through inhibition of the Src/FAK signaling pathway.",Int. J.

30816464,PADI4‑mediated epithelial‑mesenchymal transition in lung cancer cells.,"Lung cancer is a complex disease involving multiple genetic and phenotypic alterations. As a histone modification enzyme, protein‑arginine deiminase type‑4 (PADI4) and its downstream signaling have been studied in the progression of a variety of types of human cancer, but data on PADI4‑mediated posttranslational modification in lung cancer are lacking. The aim of present study was to evaluate the expression of PADI4 and its associated molecular signaling in lung cancer metastasis. The results of the present study indicated that PADI4 was overexpressed in lung cancer cells, while knockdown of PADI4 could lead to attenuation of the lung cancer cell invasion and migration phenotype, which was further verified by determining the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker proteins. Additionally, it was demonstrated that stable knockdown of PADI4 in A549 lung cancer cells resulted in a striking reduction of the EMT‑associated Snail1/mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3/4 transcriptional complex, which was consistent with alterations in migratory and invasive phenotypes of A549 lung cancer cells. Therefore, PADI4‑mediated EMT transition is proposed to represent a novel mechanism underlying the epigenetic and phenotypic alterations in lung cancer cells, and the PADI4 associated signaling pathway may be a therapeutic target for treating lung cancer in a clinical setting.",Mol Med Rep,2019,"['Liu M', 'Qu Y', 'Teng X', 'Xing Y', 'Li D', 'Li C', 'Cai L']",
30816447,Differential expression and functions of Ehm2 transcript variants in lung adenocarcinoma.,"Ehm2 [also known as erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1‑like protein 4B (EPB41L4B)] is a member of the NF2/ERM/4.1 superfamily. The overexpression of Ehm2 has been observed in metastatic cancer cells. Through alternative splicing, the Ehm2 gene produces two transcript variants that encode the two different isoforms, Ehm2/1 and Ehm2/2. The biological functions of these different Ehm2 transcript variants remain unclear. The present study aimed to determine the expression of the Ehm2 variants in lung adenocarcinoma and their involvement in the disease progression of the patients. The expression of Ehm2 transcript variants in human lung adenocarcinoma tissues was analyzed using immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Ehm2 variants were overexpressed or knocked down in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. The consequent effects of the genetic modifications on the cellular functions of lung cancer cells were then examined using in vitro cell viability, invasion and migration assays. The expression of epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT)‑related markers was evaluated by western blot analysis in the cell models. The association of Ehm2 variant expression with patient survival was analyzed using Kaplan‑Meier survival analysis. The expression of Ehm2/1 was significantly decreased in lung cancers compared with the paired normal lung tissues (P<0.05), while the Ehm2/2 protein levels were higher in the tumors than in the paired normal lung tissues, although this was not statistically significant. The overexpression of Ehm2/1 exerted inhibitory effects, while the knockdown of Ehm2/1 promoted the growth, invasion and migration of A549 cells in vitro. Ehm2/2 was expressed at low levels in the A549 cells and the enforced expression of Ehm2/2 significantly increased the invasiveness and migration of the A549 cells. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that Ehm2/1 was confined to the plasma membrane, while Ehm2/2 was observed at both the plasma membrane and cytoplasm. The overexpression of Ehm2/1 resulted in the upregulation of the epithelial marker, E‑cadherin, and in the decreased expression of the mesenchymal markers, N‑cadherin and Snail1, while the knockdown of Ehm2/1 and the enforced expression of Ehm2/2 had the opposite effects on the protein levels of EMT‑related markers. Kaplan‑Meier survival analysis revealed that higher Ehm2/1 transcript levels were associated with the longer survival of patients with lung adenocarcinoma, while the lower expression of Ehm2/2 exhibited a similar association with patient survival. Taken together, the two Ehm2 variants appear to be differentially expressed in lung adenocarcinoma. Ehm2/1 may function as a putative tumor suppressor in the disease progression of lung adenocarcinoma, while Ehm2/2 may have an opposite function.",Int. J.

30815959,A disintegrin and metalloprotease 23 hypermethylation predicts decreased disease-free survival in low-risk breast cancer patients.,"A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease 23 (ADAM23), a member of the ADAM family, is involved in neuronal differentiation and cancer. ADAM23 is considered a possible tumor suppressor gene and is frequently downregulated in various types of malignancies. Its epigenetic silencing through promoter hypermethylation was observed in breast cancer (BC). In the present study, we evaluated the prognostic significance of ADAM23 promoter methylation for hematogenous spread and disease-free survival (DFS). Pyrosequencing was used to quantify ADAM23 methylation in tumors of 203 BC patients. Presence of circulating tumor cells (CTC) in their peripheral blood was detected by quantitative RT-PCR. Expression of epithelial (KRT19) or mesenchymal (epithelial-mesenchymal transition [EMT]-inducing transcription factors TWIST1, SNAI1, SLUG and ZEB1) mRNA transcripts was examined in CD45-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells. ADAM23 methylation was significantly lower in tumors of patients with the mesenchymal CTC (P = .006). It positively correlated with Ki-67 proliferation, especially in mesenchymal CTC-negative patients (P = .001). In low-risk patients, characterized by low Ki-67 and mesenchymal CTC absence, ADAM23 hypermethylation was an independent predictor of DFS (P = .006). Our results indicate that ADAM23 is likely involved in BC progression and dissemination of mesenchymal CTC.

However, the biological role and molecular mechanism of TRIM29 in the invasion and metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC) remain to be determined.
METHODS: The expression levels of TRIM29 and β-catenin in CRC patient specimens were detected by immunohistochemistry. Recombinant lentivirus vectors containing the TRIM29 gene and its small hairpin interfering RNAs were constructed and transduced into CRC cells. Wound-healing and Transwell assays were performed to evaluate the migration and invasion abilities of CRC cells in vitro. Hepatic metastasis models in nude mice were established to validate the function of TRIM29 in vivo. Moreover, the expressions of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated proteins were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blotting in CRC cells. Finally, Western blotting, qRT-PCR, luciferase reporter assays, and immunofluorescence assays were used to explore the molecular mechanisms of TRIM29 in CRC progression.
RESULTS: Increased TRIM29 expression positively correlated with lymph node metastasis and β-catenin expression in patient CRC tissues. Overexpression of TRIM29 promoted invasion and metastasis of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo by regulating EMT, whereas the knockdown of TRIM29 had the opposite effect. Further mechanistic studies suggest that TRIM29 can activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway via up-regulating CD44 expression in colorectal cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: TRIM29 induces EMT through activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway via up-regulating CD44 expression, thus promoting invasion and metastasis of CRC.",J. Exp. Clin.

30810948,The Relationship between Exosomes and Cancer: Implications for Diagnostics and Therapeutics.,"Exosomes are very small extracellular vesicles secreted by cells to local and distant tissues. These mini signal transporters elicit acute and chronic effects on recipient cells. Studies regarding exosomes and their relationship to disease, as well as healthy functions, are eliciting extraordinary excitement as data pours in from groups around the world. Reporting of exosome biogenesis, selective loading of cargo, directed release, and resulting changes in adjacent and distal cells are providing information that is changing the way we view cancer progression and treatment. As a result, the properties of exosomes are being exploited for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic applications. First, by referring to the signaling molecules carried by exosomes, they are being tested as indicators of the presence of transformed cells in early stages of cancer. Secondly, the cargo of exosomes secreted from tumors have been linked to prognostic factors and metastatic properties. Thirdly, exosome-based therapies are being developed which utilize the inherent properties of these mini-transporters to affect and interfere with cancer. Exosome creation, loading, and release plays an important role in cancer formation, progression and organotropic metastasis. The developed and developing therapies should be considered with understanding of their advantages and pitfalls, as well as the various roles exosomes play in normal and pathogenic processes.

We found that melatonin down-regulated EMT by inhibiting Twist/Twist1 (twist family bHLH transcription factor 1) expression. This effect was mediated by MT1 receptor, PLC, p38/ERK and β-catenin signaling cascades. Twist expression was positively correlated with tumor stage and negatively correlated with MT1 expression in lung cancer specimens.

Here, we report that apical-basal polarity inhibits EMT to suppress metastatic dissemination. Using mouse and human epithelial three-dimensional organoid cultures, we show that the PAR-atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) polarity complex inhibits EMT and invasion by promoting degradation of the SNAIL family protein SNAI1. Under intact apical-basal polarity, aPKC kinases phosphorylate S249 of SNAI1, which leads to protein degradation. Loss of apical-basal polarity prevents aPKC-mediated SNAI1 phosphorylation and stabilizes the SNAI1 protein to promote EMT and invasion. In human breast tumour xenografts, inhibition of the PAR-complex-mediated SNAI1 degradation mechanism promotes tumour invasion and metastasis. Analyses of human breast tissue samples reveal negative correlations between PAR3 and SNAI1 protein levels. Our results demonstrate that apical-basal polarity functions as a critical checkpoint of EMT to precisely control epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity during tumour metastasis.",Nat.

In this study, we investigated the effects of anoctamin-1 (ANO1) and miR-9 on colorectal cancer (CRC) cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and determined the underlying molecular mechanisms. Thirty-two paired CRC tissues and adjacent normal tissues were analyzed for ANO1 expression using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). HCT116 cells were transiently transfected with miR-9 mimic, miR-9 inhibitor, or si-ANO1. Cell proliferation was determined by MTT, and flow cytometric analysis, while cell migration and invasion were assayed by trans-well migration and invasion assay in HCT116 cells. ANO1 was validated as a target of miR-9 using luciferase reporter assay and bioinformatics algorithms. We found that ANO1 expression was up-regulated in CRC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. ANO1 expression was associated with advanced tumor stage and lymph node metastasis, and there was an inverse relationship between miR-9 and ANO1 mRNA expression in CRC specimens, but no significant difference was found between miR-9 and ANO1 expression. ANO1 is a direct target of miR-9, and overexpression of miR-9 suppressed both mRNA and protein expression of ANO1 and inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCT116 cells. We also showed that overexpression of miR-9 suppressed expression of p-AKT, cyclin D1, and p-ERK in HCT116 cells. We conclude that miR-9 inhibits CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by directly targeting ANO1, and miR-9/ANO1 could be a potential therapeutic target for CRC.",Cancer Genet,2019,"['Park YR', 'Lee ST', 'Kim SL', 'Zhu SM', 'Lee MR', 'Kim SH', 'Kim IH', 'Lee SO', 'Seo SY', 'Kim SW']",

METHOD: The levels of miR-451 were tested in colon cancer cell lines (SW480 and SW48). Multiple functional and immunological assays were performed to analyse miR-451 induced growth changes in-vitro and downstream effects on target proteins.
RESULTS: Overexpression of miR-451 in colon cancer cells led to reduced cell proliferation, increased apoptosis and decrease accumulation of the cells at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. In addition, a significant increase in the number of the cells was noted in the G2-M phase of cell cycle. Moreover, miR-451 reduced the expression of Oct-4, Sox-2 and Snail indicating its role in stem cell and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulation. An inverse correlation between miR-451 and macrophage migration inhibitory protein (MIF) protein expression occurred in colon cancer cells.

Recently, microRNAs have been reported to play crucial functions in multiple tumors, including HCC. However, the molecular mechanisms of miR-370 in HCC still remain largely unknown. The present study focused on the effects of miR-370 on HCC migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the key roles and possible regulatory mechanism of miR-370 in regulating HCC metastasis with functional assays, such as transwell assay. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect miR-370 and guanylylcyclase domain containing 1 (GUCD1) expression in HCC tissues and cells. Subsequently, we performed transwell assays to determine the functions of miR-370 in HCC cell invasion and migration. Western blot was used to determine protein expressions of relevant genes. Luciferase reporter assays were conducted to confirm the target gene of miR-370.
RESULTS: qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that miR-370 was dramatically downregulated in HCC. Moreover, downregulated miR-370 was found to be associated with poor survival and adverse clinicopathologic characteristics of HCC patients. Transwell assays revealed that miR-370 overexpression dramatically suppressed HCC invasion and migration. Meanwhile, miR-370 restoration prominently inhibited EMT progression in HCC cells.

However, the mechanisms of recurrence and/or metastasis (recurrence/metastasis) has still remained unknown. Here, we report two cases of renal EAML associated with recurrence/metastasis, and three cases of EAML in kidney or liver without recurrence/metastasis. According to the previous histological predictive models of EAML, the primary tumor was classified as low risk group in one of the cases with recurrence/metastasis in spite of its malignant behavior. Therefore, we considered that further investigation about the mechanisms of recurrence/metastasis in EAML is required for a malignancy prediction. We focused on some cell-cycle modulators, including mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), which is ubiquitin ligase well-known to promote malignant behaviors by p53 ubiquitination and degradation, and also other cellular processes including genomic instability and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in p53-independent manners in various human malignancies. Immunohistochemical evaluation revealed that MDM2 protein expression increased stepwise throughout every steps of metastasis/recurrence in both cases, although it was negative in primary tumors. In conclusion, this is the first study demonstrating that MDM2 could play an important role in the molecular mechanisms of recurrence/metastasis of EAML.

The goal of our project was to study the effects of IGF-I on expression of protein markers of epithelial and mesenchymal differentiation, and on expression of transcriptional regulators of EMT in pancreatic cancer cell lines.
METHODS: We used Western blot analysis to study the expression patterns of epithelial and mesenchymal protein markers in pancreatic cancer cell lines, which have been stimulated with IGF-I for various periods of time. The ELISA technique was employed to determine the concentration of IGF-I in conditioned media. Additionally, the effect of IGF-I on proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells was measured via MTS technique.
RESULTS: We investigated the effect of IGF/IGF-IR signaling pathway activation on expression levels of cell differentiation markers in five pancreatic cancer cell lines (AsPC-1, BxPC-3, Capan-2, MiaPaCa-2 and Panc1). The IGF-I stimulation led to phosphorylation of IGF-IR and activation of PI-3K/Akt signaling cascade. At the same time our results reveal that the activation of IGF/IGF-IR signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer cells does not induce a significant shift in cell phenotype towards mesenchymal differentiation and does not induce a decrease in expression levels of epithelial protein markers.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that IGF-I does not function as an effective inductor of EMT in pancreatic cancer cell lines and that stimulation of IGF-I/IGF-IR signaling pathway does not lead to EMT associated changes in cell differentiation.",Pancreatology,2019,"['Kopantzev EP', 'Kopantseva MR', 'Grankina EV', 'Mikaelyan A', 'Egorov VI', 'Sverdlov ED']",

Luteolin (3,4,5,7-tetrahydroxy flavone) is a flavonoid found in different plants such as vegetables, medicinal herbs, and fruits. It acts as an anticancer agent against various types of human malignancies such as lung, breast, glioblastoma, prostate, colon, and pancreatic cancers. It also blocks cancer development in vitro and in vivo by inhibition of proliferation of tumor cells, protection from carcinogenic stimuli, and activation of cell cycle arrest, and by inducing apoptosis through different signaling pathways. Luteolin can additionally reverse epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through a mechanism that involves cytoskeleton shrinkage, induction of the epithelial biomarker E-cadherin expression, and by down-regulation of the mesenchymal biomarkers N-cadherin, snail, and vimentin. Furthermore, luteolin increases levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) by activation of lethal endoplasmic reticulum stress response and mitochondrial dysfunction in glioblastoma cells, and by activation of ER stress-associated proteins expressions, including phosphorylation of eIF2α, PERK, CHOP, ATF4, and cleaved-caspase 12.

30796356,mTORC1 inhibitor RAD001 (everolimus) enhances non-small cell lung cancer cell radiosensitivity in vitro via suppressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition.,"Resistance to radiotherapy causes non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment failure associated with local recurrence and metastasis. Thus, understanding the radiosensitization of NSCLC cells is crucial for developing new treatments and improving prognostics. mTORC1 has been shown to regulate tumor cell radiosensitivity, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Moreover, mTORC1 also regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that is important to metastasis and recurrence. In this study we explored whether mTORC1 regulated NSCLC cell radiosensitivity by altering EMT. We performed immunohistichemical analysis using tumor, adjacent and normal tissues from 50 NSCLC patients, which confirmed significantly elevated mTOR protein expression in NSCLC tissue. Then we used NCI-H460 and NCI-H661 cell lines to examine the effects of the mTORC1 inhibitor RAD001 (everolimus) on in vitro radiosensitivity, protein expression and dose-survival curves. RAD001 (10 nmol/L) significantly inhibited the mTORC1 pathway in both the cell lines. Pretreatment with RAD001 (0.1 nmol/L) enhanced the radiosensitivity in NCI-H661 cells with wild-type PIK3CA and KRAS but not in NCI-H460 cells with mutant PIK3CA and KRAS; the sensitivity enhancement ratios in the two NSCLC cell lines were 1.40 and 1.03, respectively. Furthermore, pretreatment with RAD001 (0.1 nmol/L) significantly decreased the migration and invasion with altered expression of several EMT-associated proteins (significantly increased E-cadherin and decreased vimentin expression) in irradiated NCI-H661 cells. Publicly available expression data confirmed that irradiation affected mTOR and EMT-associated genes at the transcript level in NSCLC cells. These results suggest that mTORC1 inhibition enhances the in vitro radiosensitivity of NSCLC cells with wild-type PIK3CA and KRAS by affecting EMT.

A next-generation tissue microarray (ngTMA) of matched Pan-CK-positive and -negative stroma was constructed and stained for E-cadherin, VIM, Snail1, Twist1, Zeb1 and Zeb2, COL11A1, SPARC, CD90, α-SMA, FAP and WT1. CK+/VIM+ co-expressing tumor cells were detected using all three methods. With DepArray, only tumor budding areas contained CK+/VIM+ cells. The proportion of CK+/VIM+ tumor cells was low (1.5%-22%). CK+ stroma was associated with aggressive tumor features like distant metastasis (P = .0003), lymphatic invasion (P = .0009) and tumor budding (P = .0084). CK+/VIM+ stroma was characterized by positive WT1 (P < .001), ZEB2 (P < .001), TWIST1 (P = .009), and FAP (P = .003). Our data suggest that CK+/VIM+ tumor cells exist, albeit in low numbers and could represent a subgroup of tumor buds in partial EMT. CK+/VIM+ stroma may be of mesothelial origin and shows features of mesenchymal cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts. These results, together with the association with metastasis point to cells in mesothelial-mesenchymal transition (MMT). This atypical stroma may be a potential target for therapy.",Hum.

30790340,ETS1 is coexpressed with ZEB2 and mediates ZEB2-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in human tumors.,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an embryonic program that is reactivated in cancer and regulates the invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. Zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) induces EMT by upregulating matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), yet MMP genes lack ZEB2 binding motif in their promoters. Recently, expression of MMPs was associated to the activation of ETS1 transcription factor; however, a link between ZEB2 and ETS proto-oncogene 1, transcription factor (ETS1) remains to be elucidated. Hence, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of ETS1 by ZEB2 after our initial observation that ZEB2 and ETS1 are coexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCCs). Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays clearly showed that ZEB2 binds to E-box sequences on the promoter of ETS1. Elevated expression of ETS1 was found in DLD-ZEB2 and A431-ZEB2 inducible systems, and knockdown of ZEB2 caused an explicit downregulation of ETS1 in shZEB2-SNU398 and shZEB2-SK-HEP-1 cells. Repression of ETS1 expression in ZEB2-induced conditions substantially impaired the migration and invasive capacities of DLD1 cells. Mechanistically, knockdown of ETS1 in ZEB2-expressing cells resulted in the downregulation of established ZEB2 targets TWIST and MMP9. Correlation analyses in HCC lines, cancer complementary DNA arrays, and The Cancer Genome Atlas RNA-sequencing data set revealed that ZEB2 and ETS1 are coexpressed, and their expressions in human tumors show a highly significant positive correlation. Our results demonstrated that ZEB2 acts as an upstream regulator of ETS1 and, in turn, ETS1 maintains ZEB2-induced EMT. These findings add another level of complexity to the understanding of ZEB2 in the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells, and put ZEB2/ETS1 axis as a novel therapeutic target in human malignancies.",Mol.

30785618,Interplay between miRNAs and host genes and their role in cancer.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous non-coding functional RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. They play essential roles in nearly all biological processes including cell development and differentiation, DNA damage repair, cell death as well as intercellular communication. They are highly involved in cancer, acting as tumor suppressors and/or promoters to modulate cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumor invasion and metastasis. Recent studies have shown that more than half of miRNAs are located within protein-coding or non-coding genes. Intragenic miRNAs and their host genes either share the promoter or have independent transcription. Meanwhile, miRNAs work as partners or antagonists of their host genes by fine-tuning their target genes functionally associated with host genes. This review outlined the complicated relationship between intragenic miRNAs and host genes. Focusing on miRNAs known as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in specific cancer types, it studied co-expression relationships between these miRNAs and host genes in the cancer types using TCGA data sets, which validated previous findings and revealed common, tumor-specific and even subtype-specific patterns. These observations will help understand the function of intragenic miRNAs and further develop miRNA therapeutics in cancer.",Brief Funct Genomics,2018,"['Liu B', 'Shyr Y', 'Cai J', 'Liu Q']",
30784920,Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells suppress growth and promote the apoptosis of glioma U251 cells through downregulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), with the capacity for self-renewal and differentiation into multiple cell types, exhibit the property of homing towards tumor sites and immunosuppression and have been used as tumor-tropic vectors for tumor therapy. However, few studies have investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms that link MSCs to targeted tumor cells. In this study, we elucidated the inhibitory effects and mechanisms of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) on human glioma U251 cells using a co-culture system in vitro. The anti-tumor activity of co-cultured hBMSCs was assessed by morphological changes, the MTT assay, and Hoechst 33258 staining. Cell apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were evaluated by flow cytometry. Cell migration and invasion were evaluated using a 24-well Transwell chamber. A proteomics approach was used to identify differentially expressed proteins after hBMSCs treatment in U251 cells, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to validate the results. Bioinformatics analyses were also implemented to better understand the identified proteins, and Western blotting analyses were used to analyze the associated proteins. The results showed that hBMSCs could inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, resulting in apoptosis of U251 cells. Transwell and Matrigel invasion assays showed that hBMSCs reduced the migration and invasion of U251 cells. Using proteomics, 11 differentially expressed proteins were identified and observed. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that the identified proteins participated in several biological processes and exhibited various molecular functions, mainly related to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathway. Moreover, hBMSCs regulated changes in proteins linked to cell apoptosis and cell cycle progression and inhibited the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like and PI3K/AKT pathway. Taken together, the findings in our study suggest that hBMSCs inhibit U251 cells proliferation and the EMT-like by downregulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which indicates that hBMSCs have a potential antitumor characteristics and should be further explored in future glioma therapy.",Biomed.

30784915,Network-pharmacology-based identiﬁcation of caveolin-1 as a key target of Oldenlandia diffusa to suppress breast cancer metastasis.,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer remains the most common female malignancy and metastasis is the leading cause of death in breast cancer patients. Oldenlandia diffusa has been empirically and extensively used as an adjuvant therapy for metastatic breast cancer patients in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) with proven efficacy. However, its anti-metastasis mechanism has been poorly revealed.
METHODS: Multiple molecular biology experiments as well as network pharmacology, bioinformatics analysis were conducted to investigate the anti-metastasis mechanism of Oldenlandia diffusa in breast cancer.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that ethanol extract of Oldenlandia diffusa (EEOD) significantly inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of high-metastatic breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453, while having no obvious cytotoxic effect on multiple nonmalignant cells. Furthermore, EEOD remarkably suppressed the migration and invasion capacities of the above breast cancer cells by modulating the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. More importantly, EEOD also significantly inhibited breast cancer metastasis in zebrafish xenotransplantation model in vivo. Network pharmacology and bioinformatics analysis further demonstrated that EEOD yielded 12 candidate compounds and 225 potential targets, and shared 85 putative targets associated with breast cancer metastasis. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing and experimental validation results suggested that EEOD might inhibit breast cancer metastasis by attenuating the expression of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) as overexpression of Cav-1 could weaken the anti-metastasis efficacy of EEOD.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings proved that EEOD could inhibit breast cancer metastasis by attenuating the expression of Cav-1, highlighting the use of EEOD as an adjunctive therapy for metastatic breast cancer patients. This study also provides novel insights into network pharmacology and bioinformatics analysis as effective tools to illuminate the scientific basis of TCM.",Biomed.

30782242,Targeting HIF-1α signaling pathway for gastric cancer treatment.,"Gastric cancer is a common malignancy with high mortality and limited therapeutic options. Hypoxia inducible factor-1 α (HIF-1α) is the key responser adapted to tumor hypoxia. Under hypoxia conditions, HIF-1α signaling is activated and responsible for cell biology associated with metabolism, inflammation, vascular homeostasis and tumorigenesis. Activation of HIF-1α signaling has been observed in a series of cancers including gastric cancer. Moreover, a variety of oncogene products may be induced by HIF-1α expression. Pharmacologic manipulation of HIF-1α may provide a novel therapeutic approach to gastric cancer.

30781364,(-)-Oleocanthal Combined with Lapatinib Treatment Synergized against HER-2 Positive Breast Cancer In Vitro and In Vivo.,"Dysregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/human epidermal growth factor-2 (HER2) family is a hallmark of aggressive breast cancer. Small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors are among the most effective cancer targeted treatments. (-)-Oleocanthal (OC) is a naturally occurring phenolic secoiridoid lead from extra-virgin olive oil with documented anti-cancer activities via targeting mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (c-Met). Dysregulation of c-Met promotes aggressiveness to breast cancer-targeted therapies. Lapatinib (LP) is an FDA-approved dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor for HER2-amplified breast cancer. HER2-Positive tumor cells can escape targeted therapies like LP effects by overexpressing c-Met. Combined OC-LP treatment is hypothesized to be mechanistically synergistic against HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. Combined sub-effective treatments of OC-LP resulted in synergistic anti-proliferative effects against the HER2-positive BT-474 and SK-BR-3 breast cancer cell lines, compared to OC or LP monotherapy. Antibody array and Western blot analysis showed that combined OC-LP treatment significantly inhibited EGFR, HER2, and c-Met receptor activation, as well as multiple downstream signaling proteins, compared to individual OC or LP treatment. OC-LP Combination significantly inhibited invasion and migration of breast cancer cells through reduced activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin. Combined treatment of OC-10 mg/kg with LP-12.5 mg/kg suppressed more than 90% of BT-474 tumor cells growth in a nude mouse xenograft model, compared to individual OC or LP treatment. Activated c-Met, EGFR, HER2, and protein kinase B (AKT) were significantly suppressed in combination-treated mice tumors, compared to OC or LP monotherapy.

The circ_0067934 RNA is reported to participate in hepatocellular carcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and lung cancer. Whether it regulates thyroid carcinoma remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to research potential mechanisms of circ_0067934 in thyroid tumors to provide potential new diagnostic and treatment targets. MATERIAL AND METHODS The expression level of circ_0067934 in thyroid tumors, adjacent tissues, and cell lines was measured by qRT-PCR. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis was used to explore the relationship between circ_0067934 level and survival time of patients. Circ_0067934 was knocked down to research its functional role in thyroid tumors. Cell proliferation was detected by CCK-8 (cell counting kit-8) assay. Migration and invasion were analyzed by Transwell assay. Western blot was applied to analyze the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) and PI3K/AKT related proteins. RESULTS Compared with adjacent tissue, circ_0067934 was highly expressed in thyroid tumors. Circ_0067934 expression level was highly expressed in thyroid tumor cell lines. Patients with high expression of circ_0067934 showed lower survival rates. Knockdown of circ_0067934 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and also promoted apoptosis. In addition, circ_0067934 knockdown inhibited EMT and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways.

In this study, data obtained from Oncomine database, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) analysis and Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was used to assess the expression of mortalin in serous ovarian carcinoma. The prognostic value of mortalin was analyzed using Meier plotter database and Kaplan-Meier. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide) assay, immunofluorescence (IF) staining, and colony formation assay were used to detect cell reproductive capacity. SK-OV-3 cell motility and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were measured by wound-healing, migration and western-blot assays. Data from Oncomine showed that mortalin was highly expressed in serous ovarian carcinomas compared with corresponding normal controls. Similar results were found in CCLE analysis and in clinical specimens. High mortalin expression was associated with high histological grade and worse overall survival (OS) rate. The results of MTT analyses, IF staining, and colony formation assay indicated that MKT-077 (1-Ethyl-2-[[3-ethyl-5-(3-methyl-2(3H)-benzothiazolylidene)-4-oxo-2-thiazolidinylidene] methyl]-pyridinium chloride) suppressed the viability of SK-OV-3 cells. Besides, mortalin suppression restrained cell EMT progression by Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway. Taken together, mortalin is over-expressed in serous ovarian carcinoma.

Recently, ALX1 has been reported to be associated with cancer progression. However, the specific roles of ALX1 in melanoma remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the expression pattern and biological functions of ALX1 in melanoma. We found that ALX1 was highly expressed in melanoma tissues and cell lines. Knockdown of ALX1 suppressed the proliferation and invasion of melanoma cells. Furthermore, we showed that ALX1 knockdown reversed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in melanoma cells, which might be attributed to inactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

In this study, TOX3 was identified as a novel cancer suppressor gene in ccRCC. Hypermethylation of CpG probes in the promoter region was associated with the functional loss of TOX3 in ccRCC cancer tissues. Downregulation of TOX3 mRNA was strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes in ccRCC. Immunohistochemistry confirmed TOX3 was downregulated in primary tumors without metastasis (n = 126) and further downregulated in primary metastatic tumors (n = 23) compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues (n = 92). In vitro, overexpression of TOX3 inhibited RCC cell growth, migration and invasion. Mechanistic investigations showed that TOX3 deficiency facilitates the epithelial-mesenchymal transition due to impairment of transcriptional repression of SNAIL members SNAI1 and SNAI2 and promotes cancer cell migration and invasion. In vivo, restoring TOX3 expression reduced lung metastatic lesions and prolonged survival of mice. TOX3 combined with SNAI1 or SNAI2 predicted overall survival in ccRCC patients. Blockage of this pathway could be a promising therapeutic target for advanced ccRCC.",Cancer Lett.,2019,"['Jiang B', 'Chen W', 'Qin H', 'Diao W', 'Li B', 'Cao W', 'Zhang Z', 'Qi W', 'Gao J', 'Chen M', 'Zhao X', 'Guo H']",

The aim of the present study is to investigate the involvement of EVI1 in progression and prognosis of NPC.
METHODS: RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and western blot assays were used to examine the expression of EVI1 in NPC tissues and cell lines. Fluorescence in situ hybridization assay was used to examine the amplification of EVI1 in NPC tissues. The biological effect of EVI1 was determined by both in vitro and in vivo studies. The dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm that EVI1 bind at E-cadherin andβ-catenin promoters. The ChIP, EMSA, and coimmunoprecipitation combined with mass spectrometry assays were used to analyze the EVI1 regulated proteins.
RESULTS: EVI1 expression level was up-regulated in NPC tissues and cell lines. EVI1 was amplificated in NPC tissues. We observed that EVI1 down-regulation decreased the cell proliferation and invasive capacity of NPC cells in vitro and in vivo. EVI1, snail, and HDAC1 formed a co-repressor complex to repress E-cadherin expression and ultimately contributed to epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype in NPC cells. In another way, EVI1 directly bound at β-catenin promoter and activated its expression. β-catenin mediated EVI1's function on cancer stem cells (CSCs) properties. EVI1 up-regulation predicted unfavorable prognosis and contributed to chemo/radio-resistance in NPC cells. Finally, we constructed arsenic trioxide-loaded nanoparticles (ALNPs) and revealed that ALNPs exerted anti-tumor effect in NPC cells.

30768610,Ornithine decarboxylase antizyme inhibitor 2 (AZIN2) is a signature of secretory phenotype and independent predictor of adverse prognosis in colorectal cancer.,"Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is the rate-limiting enzyme of polyamine synthesis. The two ODC antizyme inhibitors (AZIN1) and (AZIN2) are regulators of the catalytic activity of ODC. While AZIN1 is a regulator of cell proliferation, AZIN2 is involved in intracellular vesicle transport and secretion. There are no previous reports on the impact of AZIN2 expression in human cancer. We applied immunohistochemistry with antibodies to human AZIN2 on tissue micro- arrays of colorectal cancers (CRC) from 840 patients with a median follow-up of 5.1 years (range 0-25.8). The 5-year disease-specific survival rate was 58.9% (95% Cl 55.0-62.8%). High AZIN2 expression was associated with mucinous histology (p = 0.002) and location in the right hemicolon (p = 0.021). We found no association with age, gender, stage, or histological tumor grade. High tumor expression of AZIN2 predicted an unfavorable prognosis (p<0.0001, log-rank test), compared to low AZIN2 expression. Cox multivariable analysis identified AZIN2 as an independent factor of an unfavorable prognosis in CRC. The strongest AZIN2 expression was seen in invasive tumor cells having morphological features of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Induction of EMT in HT-29 CRC cells lead to upregulated expression of endogenous AZIN2. Given that AZIN2 is a regulator of vesicle transport and secretion, we overexpressed human AZIN2 cDNA in T84 CRC cells, and found strongly enhanced accumulation of CD63-positive exosomes in the culture medium. These findings indicate that AZIN2 expression is a signature of EMT-associated secretory phenotype that is linked to an adverse prognosis in CRC.",PLoS ONE,2019,"['Kaprio T', 'Rasila T', 'Hagström J', 'Mustonen H', 'Lankila P', 'Haglund C', 'Andersson LC']",
30767161,Elevated expression of GNAS promotes breast cancer cell proliferation and migration via the PI3K/AKT/Snail1/E-cadherin axis.,"PURPOSE: Although it has been well established that G protein plays pivotal roles in physiologic or pathologic conditions, including cancer formation, its role in breast cancer, especially specific subunits, remains largely unknown. Our work aimed to evaluate the correlation of the G protein alpha subunit (GNAS) with breast cancer and to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism.
METHODS: The expression of GNAS was determined by breast tumor tissue microarray of 150 patients with complete follow-up information. The correlation between GNAS expression and clinical features was assessed. CCK8, EdU incorporation, flow cytometry, wound healing, transwell, western blot and tumor formation assays were carried out in nude mice to study the biological function of GNAS and the underlying molecular mechanism in breast cancer by silencing GNAS using a specific siRNA.
RESULTS: High GNAS expression showed a close correlation with a reduced overall survival (p = 0.021), frequent distal metastasis (p = 0.026), advanced clinical stage (p = 0.001), stronger cell proliferation (ki67

We explored the biologic significance and preclinical efficacy of Axl inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in sorafenib-naive and resistant HCC.
METHODS: We evaluated Axl expression in sorafenib-naive and resistant (SR) clones of epithelial (HuH7) and mesenchymal origin (SKHep-1) using antibody arrays and confirmed tissue expression. We tested the effect of Axl inhibition with RNA-interference and pharmacologically with R428 on a number of phenotypic assays.
RESULTS: Axl mRNA overexpression in cell lines (n = 28) and RNA-seq tissue datasets (n = 373) correlated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Axl was overexpressed in HCC compared to cirrhosis and normal liver. We confirmed sorafenib resistance to be associated with EMT and enhanced motility in both HuH7-SR and SKHep-1-SR cells documenting a 4-fold increase in Axl phosphorylation as an adaptive feature of chronic sorafenib treatment in SKHep-1-SR cells. Axl inhibition reduced motility and enhanced sensitivity to sorafenib in SKHep-1SR cells. In patients treated with sorafenib (n = 40), circulating Axl levels correlated with shorter survival.

Isolation of a cell-surface protease system for lung cancer metastasis is an important issue for mechanistic studies and therapeutic target identification.
METHODS: Immunohistochemistry of a tissue array (n = 64) and TCGA database (n = 255) were employed to assess the correlation between serine protease inhibitors (SPIs) and lung adenocarcinoma progression. The role of SPI in cell motility was examined using transwell assays. Pulldown and LC/MS/MS were performed to identify the SPI-modulated novel protease(s). A xenografted mouse model was harnessed to demonstrate the role of the SPI in lung cancer metastasis.
RESULTS: Hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-2 (HAI-2) was identified to be downregulated following lung cancer progression, which was related to poor survival and tumour invasion. We further isolated a serum-derived serine protease, plasmin, to be a novel target of HAI-2. Downregulation of HAI-2 promotes cell surface plasmin activity, EMT, and cell motility. HAI-2 can suppress plasmin-mediated activations of HGF and TGF-β1, EMT and cell invasion. In addition, downregulated HAI-2 increased metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma via upregulating plasmin activity.

In in vitro analysis, associated indices for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration, and proliferation of 4T1 cells were evaluated. The results show that HO-1 inhibits EMT, migration, and proliferation of 4T1 cells. In addition, the Notch1/Slug pathway is found to mediate an antimetastasis role of HO-1 in mouse mammary carcinoma.

There are various E3 ligases mediating its degradation, but the deubiquitinating enzyme reversed Snail degradation is not fully understood. In this study, we screened a DUB library and found USP26 is a potent deubiquitinase mediating Snail stabilization. We also identified that USP26 is a booster of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cell migration and invasion, and it is highly expressed in ESCC samples.

30760238,Hypoxia-induced cancer stemness acquisition is associated with CXCR4 activation by its aberrant promoter demethylation.,"BACKGROUND: A hypoxic microenvironment leads to an increase in the invasiveness and the metastatic potential of cancer cells within tumors via the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stemness acquisition. However, hypoxia-induced changes in the expression and function of candidate stem cell markers and their possible molecular mechanism is still not understood.
METHODS: Lung cell lines were analyzed in normoxic or hypoxic conditions. For screening among the stem cell markers, a transcriptome analysis using next-generation sequencing was performed. For validation, the EMT and stem cell characteristics were analyzed. To determine whether an epigenetic mechanism was involved, the cell lines were treated with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (AZA), and methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing were performed.
RESULTS: Next-generation sequencing revealed that the CXCR4 expression was significantly higher after the hypoxic condition, which functionally resulted in the EMT and cancer stemness acquisition. The acquisition of the EMT and stemness properties was inhibited by treatment with CXCR4 siRNA. The CXCR4 was activated by either the hypoxic condition or treatment with AZA.

30755582,PAK4 signaling in health and disease: defining the PAK4-CREB axis.,"p21-Activated kinase 4 (PAK4), a member of the PAK family, regulates a wide range of cellular functions, including cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and survival. Dysregulation of its expression and activity thus contributes to the development of diverse pathological conditions. PAK4 plays a pivotal role in cancer progression by accelerating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, and metastasis. Therefore, PAK4 is regarded as an attractive therapeutic target in diverse types of cancers, prompting the development of PAK4-specific inhibitors as anticancer drugs; however, these drugs have not yet been successful. PAK4 is essential for embryonic brain development and has a neuroprotective function. A long list of PAK4 effectors has been reported. Recently, the transcription factor CREB has emerged as a novel effector of PAK4. This finding has broad implications for the role of PAK4 in health and disease because CREB-mediated transcriptional reprogramming involves a wide range of genes. In this article, we review the PAK4 signaling pathways involved in prostate cancer, Parkinson's disease, and melanogenesis, focusing in particular on the PAK4-CREB axis.",Exp. Mol.

30755531,Dynamically stiffened matrix promotes malignant transformation of mammary epithelial cells via collective mechanical signaling.,"Breast cancer development is associated with increasing tissue stiffness over years. To more accurately mimic the onset of gradual matrix stiffening, which is not feasible with conventional static hydrogels, mammary epithelial cells (MECs) were cultured on methacrylated hyaluronic acid hydrogels whose stiffness can be dynamically modulated from ""normal"" (<150 Pascals) to ""malignant"" (>3,000 Pascals) via two-stage polymerization. MECs form and remain as spheroids, but begin to lose epithelial characteristics and gain mesenchymal morphology upon matrix stiffening. However, both the degree of matrix stiffening and culture time before stiffening play important roles in regulating this conversion as, in both cases, a subset of mammary spheroids remained insensitive to local matrix stiffness. This conversion depended neither on colony size nor cell density, and MECs did not exhibit ""memory"" of prior niche when serially cultured through cycles of compliant and stiff matrices. Instead, the transcription factor Twist1, transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), and YAP activation appeared to modulate stiffness-mediated signaling; when stiffness-mediated signals were blocked, collective MEC phenotypes were reduced in favor of single MECs migrating away from spheroids. These data indicate a more complex interplay of time-dependent stiffness signaling, spheroid structure, and soluble cues that regulates MEC plasticity than suggested by previous models.",Proc. Natl.

Considered the pivotal role of epithelial-tomesenchymaltransition (EMT) in carcinoma progression, including prostate cancer (PCa), weaimed at investigating the effect of the 3D arrangement on the expression of some key markers ofEMT in cultured human prostate cancer (PCa) cells, to better understand PCa cell behavior. PC3 andDU145 PCa cells were cultured in RPMI cell culture medium either in 2D-monolayers or in 3Dspheroids.The main EMT markers E-cadherin, N-cadherin, α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA),vimentin, Snail, Slug, Twist and Zeb1 were evaluated by confocal microscopy, real-time PCR andWestern blot. Confocal microscopy revealed that E-cadherin was similarly expressed at the cellboundaries on the plasma membrane of PCa cells grown in 2D-monolayers, as well as in 3Dspheroids,but resulted up-regulated in 3D-spheroids, compared to 2D-monolayers, at the mRNAand protein level. Moreover, markers of the mesenchymal phenotype were expressed at very lowlevels in 3D-spheroids, suggesting important differences in the phenotype of PCa cells grown in 3Dspheroidsor in 2D-monolayers.

A total of 305 lung adenocarcinoma tissues and four human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (i.e. Calu‑3, NCI‑H1975, A549 and NCI‑H23) were used. pcDNA3.1‑H19, short interfering RNA (si‑)H19, miR‑29b‑3p mimic, miR‑29b‑3p inhibitor and negative control (NC) were transfected into the cells, and the proliferation, viability and apoptosis of the cells were determined using a Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay, colony formation assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The results indicated that highly expressed H19 and poorly expressed miR‑29b‑3p could serve as predictors for the poor prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients. Additionally, si‑H19 and miR‑29b‑3p mimic significantly increased the apoptosis of lung adenocarcinoma cells, and decreased the survival rate and viability of cells. Simultaneously, expression of epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT)‑specific proteins was significantly altered, i.e. increased epithelial cadherin expression, as well as decreased vimentin, Snail and Slug expression. Furthermore, miR‑29b‑3p was verified to be targeted and regulated by H19, and STAT3 was targeted and modified by miR‑29b‑3p. Ultimately, STAT3 was identified to decrease lung adenocarcinoma cell viability, survival, apoptosis and EMT imposed by miR‑29b‑3p. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that lncRNA H19/miR‑29b‑3p/STAT3 signaling was involved in the development of lung adenocarcinoma, which may be critical for developing effective diagnostic and treatment strategies for lung adenocarcinoma.",Int.

30745850,SMARCAD1 Promotes Pancreatic Cancer Cell Growth and Metastasis through Wnt/β-catenin-Mediated EMT.,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most lethal diseases, characterized by early metastasis and high mortality. Subunits of the SWI/SNF complex have been identified in many studies as the regulators of tumor progression, but the role of SMARCAD1, one member of the SWI/SNF family, in pancreatic cancer has not been elucidated. Based on analysis of GEO database and immunohistochemical detection of patient-derived pancreatic cancer tissues, we found that SMARCAD1 is more highly expressed in pancreatic cancer tissues and that its expression level negatively correlates with patients' survival time. With further investigation, it shows that SMARCAD1 promotes the proliferation, migration, invasion of pancreatic cancer cells. Mechanistically, we first demonstrate that SMARCAD1 induces EMT via activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer. Our results provide the role and potential mechanism of SMARCAD1 in pancreatic cancer, which may prove useful marker for diagnostic or therapeutic applications of PC disease.",Int. J. Biol.

30745575,PKNOX2 suppresses gastric cancer through the transcriptional activation of IGFBP5 and p53.,"Promoter methylation plays a vital role in tumorigenesis through transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressive genes. Using genome-wide methylation array, we first identified PBX/Knotted Homeobox 2 (PKNOX2) as a candidate tumor suppressor in gastric cancer. PKNOX2 mRNA expression is largely silenced in gastric cancer cell lines and primary gastric cancer via promoter methylation. Promoter methylation of PKNOX2 was associated with poor survival in gastric cancer patients. A series of in vitro and in vivo functional studies revealed that PKNOX2 functions as a tumor suppressor. Ectopic PKNOX2 expression inhibited cell proliferation in GC cell lines and suppressed growth of tumor xenografts in mice via induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest; and suppressed cell migration and invasion by blocking epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. On the other hand, knockdown PKNOX2 in normal gastric epithelial cells triggered diverse malignant phenotypes. Mechanistically, PKNOX2 exerts its tumor suppressive effect by promoting the up-regulation of Insulin like Growth Factor Binding Protein 5 (IGFBP5) and TP53. PKNOX2 binds to the promoter regions of IGFBP5 and TP53 and transcriptionally activated their expression by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR assay. IGFBP5 knockdown partly abrogated tumor suppressive effect of PKNOX2, indicating that the function(s) of PKNOX2 are dependent on IGFBP5. IGFBP5 promoted PKNOX2-mediated up-regulation of p53. As a consequence, p53 transcription target genes were coordinately up-regulated in PKNOX2-expressing GC cells, leading to tumor suppression. In summary, our results identified PKNOX2 as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer by activation of IGFBP5 and p53 signaling pathways. PKNOX2 promoter hypermethylation might be a biomarker for the poor survival of gastric cancer patients.",Oncogene,2019,"['Zhang L', 'Li W', 'Cao L', 'Xu J', 'Qian Y', 'Chen H', 'Zhang Y', 'Kang W', 'Gou H', 'Wong CC', 'Yu J']",
30744655,Axl kinase drives immune checkpoint and chemokine signalling pathways in lung adenocarcinomas.,"Axl receptor tyrosine kinase is involved in the growth and metastasis and is an indicator of poor prognosis in several cancers including lung cancers. Although a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program are critical, molecular mechanisms underlying the Axl-driven cancer progression have not been fully elucidated. We aimed to identify molecules up-regulated by Axl kinase in lung adenocarcinomas. Through the global gene expression analysis and the functional annotation clustering, we found that AXL expression positively correlated with mRNA expressions of immune checkpoint molecules and chemokine receptors in non-small-cell lung cancers. Validation cohorts including our biobank confirmed that the AXL expression significantly correlated with expression of genes encoding programmed death-ligand1 (PD-L1) and CXC chemokine receptor 6 (CXCR6) in lung adenocarcinoma, especially in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive adenocarcinoma. Pharmacological inhibition of Axl kinase activity decreased mRNA expressions of PD-L1 and CXCR6 in EGFR mutation-positive cell lines. Our data indicates the novel role of Axl kinase as a driver of immune checkpoint molecules and chemokine signalling pathways in the progression of lung adenocarcinomas.

30742939,Hypoxia induces actin cytoskeleton remodeling by regulating the binding of CAPZA1 to F-actin via PIP2 to drive EMT in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Studies have shown that hypoxia can induce cytoskeletal injury and remodeling through the activation of the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway by hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). Our previous study confirmed that CAPZA1 can modulate EMT by regulating actin cytoskeleton remodeling. However, the relationship between HIF-1α and CAPZA1 has not been illustrated. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the mechanism by which hypoxia induces the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton by regulating CAPZA1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. In the present study, we showed that the low expression of CAPZA1 promotes HCC cell invasion and migration in vitro and in vivo by regulating actin cytoskeleton remodeling to drive EMT. Furthermore, we found that the combination of PIP2 and CAPZA1 enables CAPZA1 to be released from the barbed end of F-actin, which in turn drives the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. Finally, we confirmed that hypoxia increases PIP2 levels and its binding to CAPZA1 in HCC cells via the HIF-1α/RhoA/ROCK1 pathway. Thus, CAPZA1 and PIP2 could be therapeutic targets to inhibit the invasion and migration promoted by hypoxia in HCC cells.",Cancer Lett.,2019,"['Huang D', 'Cao L', 'Xiao L', 'Song JX', 'Zhang YJ', 'Zheng P', 'Zheng SG']",

Emerging evidence indicates that it is also involved in the control of mammary stem-cell activity and biogenesis of platelets in the bone marrow, and exerts an important function in the immune response. Podoplanin expression is upregulated in different cell types, including fibroblasts, macrophages, T helper cells, and epithelial cells, during inflammation and cancer, where it plays important roles. Podoplanin is implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases, such as psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis, promotes inflammation-driven and cancer-associated thrombosis, and stimulates cancer cell invasion and metastasis through a variety of strategies. To accomplish its biological functions, podoplanin must interact with other proteins located in the same cell or in neighbor cells. The binding of podoplanin to its ligands leads to modulation of signaling pathways that regulate proliferation, contractility, migration, epithelial⁻mesenchymal transition, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix.

30736337,Control of the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition and Cancer Metastasis by Autophagy-Dependent SNAI1 Degradation.,"Autophagy, an intracellular degradation process, is essential for maintaining cell homeostasis by removing damaged organelles and proteins under various conditions of stress. In cancer, autophagy has conflicting functions. It plays a key role in protecting against cancerous transformation by maintaining genomic stability against genotoxic components, leading to cancerous transformation. It can also promote cancer cell survival by supplying minimal amounts of nutrients during cancer progression. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying how autophagy regulates the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer metastasis are unknown. Here, we show that starvation-induced autophagy promotes Snail (SNAI1) degradation and inhibits EMT and metastasis in cancer cells. Interestingly, SNAI1 proteins were physically associated and colocalized with LC3 and SQSTM1 in cancer cells. We also found a significant decrease in the levels of EMT and metastatic proteins under starvation conditions.

30735730,Encapsulated human mesenchymal stem cells (eMSCs) as a novel anti-cancer agent targeting breast cancer stem cells: Development of 3D primed therapeutic MSCs.,"Breast cancer is a leading cause of mortality in women across the globe. The major reason for its recurrence and high mortality is due to the presence of a drug refractory and self-renewing population of cells, the cancer stem cells (CSCs). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have recently emerged as a promising cell-based therapeutic agent for the treatment of different cancer types. However, the anti-tumor effect of MSCs has been indicated to be substantially reduced by their in vivo tumor-trophic migration property and direct cell-to-cell integration with tumor stromal elements. To address this drawback, the present study uses a biomaterial, sodium alginate, for the encapsulation of MSCs from the perinatal tissue, Wharton's jelly (WJMSCs) into microbeads, to study the effect of WJMSCs beads on breast CSCs derived from two breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF7. Encapsulation with sodium alginate facilitated the prevention of direct cell-to-cell interaction and these microbeads provided a three-dimensional (3D) microenvironment for the encapsulated WJMSCs (eWJMSCs). Compared to two dimensional (2D) culture, eWJMSC increased proliferation of WJMSCs with an increase in pluripotency genes, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), immune-modulation, and angiogenesis. Interestingly, the tumor invasion suppressor protein E-cadherin was highly expressed in eWJMSCs as shown by Western blot analysis. In addition, eWJMSCs had an increased secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines VEGF, TGF-β, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-10 and -6, and IL-3β when compared to 2D culture. Treatment of CSCs with eWJMSCs reduced cell viability, inhibited migration, and exerted an anti-angiogenic effect. eWJMSCs treatment of CSCs increased caspase 3/7 activity, nitric oxide production, and reactive oxygen species production, suggesting its anti-tumorigenic activity. Gene expression analysis revealed that CSCs treated with eWJMSCs had a downregulation of pro-proliferation markers, drug transporters, epithelial-mesenchymal transition-associated markers, and angiogenesis related genes. The mode of anti-proliferative action of WJMSCs beads was possibly through inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway as indicated by the upregulation of the Wnt antagonists sFRP4 and DKK1. These data suggest that alginate-encapsulated WJMSCs could be an efficient cell contact-free system for developing stem cell-based therapies for CSCs.",Int. J. Biochem.

30732622,Cathepsin L activated by mutant p53 and Egr-1 promotes ionizing radiation-induced EMT in human NSCLC.,"BACKGROUND: Ionizing radiation (IR) is one of the major clinical therapies of cancer, although it increases the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), unexpectedly. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this role are not completely understood.
METHODS: We used NSCLC cell lines as well as tumor specimens from 78 patients with NSCLC to evaluate p53, Cathepsin L (CTSL) and EMT phenotypic changes. Xenograft models was also utilized to examine the roles of mutant p53 (mut-p53) and CTSL in regulating IR-induced EMT of NSCLC.
RESULTS: Expression of CTSL was markedly increased in human NSCLC tissues with mutant p53 (mut-p53), and p53 mutation positively correlated with metastasis of NSCLC patients. In human non-small cell lung cancer cell line, H1299 cells transfected with various p53 lentivirus vectors, mut-p53 could promote the invasion and motility of cells under IR, mainly through the EMT. This EMT process was induced by elevating intranuclear CTSL which was regulated by mut-p53 depending on Early growth response protein-1 (Egr-1) activation. In the subcutaneous tumor xenograft model, IR promoted the EMT of the cancer cells in the presence of mut-p53, owing to increase expression and nuclear transition of its downstream protein CTSL.

JPYZXZ, which is ""Qi-invigorating, spleen-strengthening and stasis-removing,"" can improve the quality of life of gastric cancer patients and prolong their survival; however, the exact mechanism underlying the antitumor effects of this compound is still not clear.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study is to clearly define the effect of JPYZXZ and its components, Jianpi Yangzheng Decoction (JPYZ) and Xiao Zheng San Jie Decoction (XZSJ), on inhibiting the progression of gastric cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of JPYZXZ and its components on the motility of gastric cancer MGC-803 cells was measured by MTT, adhesion, transwell assays and wound-healing assays. JPYZXZ, JPYZ and XZSJ were administered to 615 mice with gastric cancer xenografts, and their effect on the inhibition of subcutaneous transplantation was analyzed. THP-1 monocyte cells were used to establish tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) models. The polarized state of the TAMs was detected by Flow Cytometry, ELISA and Immunohistochemistry. The mRNA and protein expression of tumor epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and TAM-related genes was determined by Real-time PCR and Western Blot, respectively.
RESULTS: We determined that both JPYZXZ and its components inhibited the progress of gastric cancer in vitro, and JPYZXZ was clearly more effective than JPYZ or XZSJ. The in vivo results demonstrated that the JPYZXZ and XZSJ group exhibited a significant decrease in the tumor weight compared to the control group. Further analysis indicated that JPYZXZ was more active than JPYZ or XZSJ in inhibiting the gastric cancer EMT transformation both in vivo and in vitro. However, JPYZ was more effective compared with JPYZXZ for inducing the phenotypic change in macrophages from M2 to M1.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that both JPYZXZ and its components prevent the progress of gastric cancer. JPYZXZ inhibits the gastric cancer EMT more effectively than JPYZ and XZSJ, but JPYZ primarily works to regulate the phenotypic change in macrophages from M2 to M1.",J Ethnopharmacol,2019,"['Wu J', 'Zhang XX', 'Zou X', 'Wang M', 'Wang HX', 'Wang YH', 'Li CY', 'Zhao LG', 'Chen M', 'Pei LX', 'Liu SL', 'Sun QM']",

This study focuses on the role of GPC1 in the promotion of cell proliferation and motility in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).
METHODS: The expression and distribution of GPC1 were measured in tumor tissues from 248 ESCC patients using immunohistochemical (IHC) assays. Cell counting (kit-8), flow cytometry, Transwell, wound healing, IHC, and Western blotting assays were performed to examine the molecular mechanisms that underlie how GPC1 enhances cell proliferation and motility.
RESULTS: The level of GPC1 was higher in ESCC tumor samples than in para-tumor tissues (IHC score: 5.42 ± 2.15 vs. 0.86 ± 0.96). Ectopic overexpression of GPC1 in EC9706 cells promoted cell growth and the G1/S phase transition; conversely, GPC1 knockdown in Eca109 cells attenuated cell proliferation and induced G2/M phase arrest. In addition, GPC1 upregulation enhanced ESCC cell motility and induced epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), as demonstrated by the aberrant expression of EMT markers. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that GPC1 increased levels of p-Akt and β-catenin and reduced PTEN expression in ESCC.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that GPC1 promotes the aggressive proliferation of ESCC cells by regulating the PTEN/Akt/β-catenin pathway. GPC1 may be a promising target for ESCC treatment.",Dig. Dis. Sci.,2019,"['Li J', 'Chen Y', 'Zhan C', 'Zhu J', 'Weng S', 'Dong L', 'Liu T', 'Shen X']",

Recent studies have demonstrated an oncogenic role of TRIM 14 in multiple human cancers; however, the importance of this protein in glioblastoma remains to be elucidated.
METHODS: The expression levels of TRIM14 were analyzed in a series of database and were examined in a variety of glioblastoma cell lines. Two independent TRIM14 shRNA were transfected into LN229 and U251 cells, and the effect of TRIM14 depletion was confirmed. Transwell assay and wound healing assay assay were carried out to assess the effect of TRIM14 depletion on glioblastoma cell invasion and migration. Western blotting was performed to screen the downstream gene of TRIM14. The stability analysis and Ubiquitylation assays and Orthotopic xenograft studies were also performed to investigate the role of TRIM14 and the relationship with downstream gene. Human glioblastoma tissues were obtained and immunohistochemical staining were carried out to confirm the clinical significance of TRIM14.
RESULTS: In this study, we showed that TRIM14 was upregulated in human glioblastoma specimens and cell lines, and correlated with glioblastoma progression and shorter patient survival times. Functional experiments showed that decreased TRIM14 expression reduced glioblastoma cell invasion and migration. Furthermore, we identified that zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2), a transcription factor involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, is a downstream target of TRIM14. Further investigation revealed that TRIM14 inactivation significantly facilitated ZEB2 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, which led to aggressive invasion and migration. Our findings provide insight into the specific biological role of TRIM14 in tumor invasion.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide insight into the specific biological role of TRIM14 in tumor invasion, and suggest that targeting the TRIM14/ZEB2 axis might be a novel therapeutic approach for blocking glioblastoma.",J.

Serum SDF-1α levels were measured in 23 patients with lung adenocarcinoma in Xuanwei, in 25 with lung adenocarcinoma outside Xuanwei, and in 22 with benign pulmonary lesions in Xuanwei.
RESULTS: SiNPs significantly promoted tumorigenesis and EMT, induced the release of SDF-1α, and activated AKT (ser473) in BEAS-2B cells. EMT and phosphorylated AKT (ser473) and glycogen synthase kinase-3β levels were decreased when blocked by SDF-1α antibody in BEAS-2B cells. SDF-1α was mainly secreted by THP-1 cells.
CONCLUSION: SiNPs combined with BPDE promote EMT of BEAS-2B cells via the AKT pathway by inducing release of SDF-1α from THP-1 cells.",J. Int. Med. Res.,2019,"['Guo C', 'You DY', 'Li H', 'Tuo XY', 'Liu ZJ']",
30720128,"SHIP1 inhibits cell growth, migration, and invasion in non‑small cell lung cancer through the PI3K/AKT pathway.","Src homology 2‑containing inositol‑5'‑phosphatase 1 (SHIP1) serves a vital role in the occurrence and development of hematological tumors, but there is limited knowledge regarding the role of SHIP1 in various solid tumors, including lung cancer. In the present study, the aim was to investigate the expression and functional mechanisms of SHIP1 in non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The Gene Expression Omnibus database demonstrated that SHIP1 had low expression in NSCLC. Further studies using fresh tissues and cell lines also confirmed this observation. Biological function analyses revealed that SHIP1 overexpression notably suppressed cell growth, migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo in NSCLC. Mechanistic analyses indicated that SHIP1 inactivated the phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway to suppress signals associated with the cell cycle and epithelial‑mesenchymal transition. In clinical specimens, reduced SHIP1 is an unfavorable factor and is negatively associated with the T classification, N classification and clinical stage. Furthermore, patients with low SHIP1 levels exhibited reduced survival rate, compared with patients with high levels of the protein. Notably, the promoter of the SHIP1 gene lacks CpG islands, and the suppression of SHIP1 expression is not associated with epidermal growth factor receptor or Kirsten rat sarcoma mutations. Thus, the present study demonstrated that SHIP1 inhibits cell growth, migration and invasion in NSCLC through the PI3K/AKT pathway. Additionally, reduced SHIP1 expression may be an unfavorable factor for NSCLC.",Oncol.

30720046,miR-135 regulated breast cancer proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition acts by the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.,"Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women around the world. microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) have been proved to be associated with the development and progression of breast cancer. In the present study, to elucidate the effects of dysregulated miR‑135 on cells and underlying mechanisms in BC, in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted. The biological functions of miR‑135 were studied using MTT, colony formation, wound healing, transwell assays as well as tumorigenicity analysis. Gain‑ and loss‑ of function of miR‑135 studies revealed that ectopic expression of miR‑135 in MDA‑MB‑468 and MCF‑7 cells significantly inhibited cell growth, migration, invasion and EMT, at least in part through inhibiting the activation of the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway. Moreover, this was reversed in cells which were transfected with miR‑135 inhibitors. Taken together, the results of the present study provided evidence that miR‑135 acted as a tumor suppressor in BC, which may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the diagnosis and prognosis of BC.",Int.

In this study, we undertook a systematic, genomewide, biomarker discovery approach to identify and validate key EMT-associated genes that may facilitate recurrence prediction in CRC. Genomewide RNA expression profiling results from two datasets (GSE17538; N = 173 and GSE41258; N = 307) were used for biomarker discovery. These results were independently validated in two, large, clinical cohorts (testing cohort; N = 201 and validation cohort; N = 468). We performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for understanding the function of the candidate markers, and evaluated their correlation with the mesenchymal CMS4 subtype. We identified integrin subunit beta like 1 (ITGBL1) as a promising candidate biomarker, and its high expression associated with poor overall survival (OS) in stage I-IV patients and relapse-free survival (RFS) in stage I-III patients. Subgroup validation in multiple independent patient cohorts confirmed these findings, and demonstrated that high ITGBL1 expression correlated with shorter RFS in stage II patients. We developed a RFS prediction model which robustly predicted RFS (the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC): 0.74; hazard ratio (HR): 2.72) in CRC patients. ITGBL1 is a promising EMT-associated biomarker for recurrence prediction in CRC patients, which may contribute to improved risk-stratification in CRC.",Mol.

However, acquired drug resistance invariably develops after its initial treatment.
METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect the expression of iNOS and hTERT, p-p65, Epcam, CD44, PCNA in mice with melanoma xenografts. The proliferation and migration of melanoma cells were detected by MTT, tumorsphere culture, cell cycle, cell apoptosis, AO/EB assay and colony formation, transwell assay and scratch assay in vitro, and tumor growth differences were observed in xenograft nude mice. Changes in the expression of key molecules in the iNOS/hTERT signaling pathways were detected by western blot. Nucleus-cytoplasm separation, and immunofluorescence analyses were conducted to explore the location of p50/p65 in melanoma cell lines. Flow cytometry assay were performed to determine the expression of CD44. Pull down assay and ChIP assay were performed to detect the binding ability of p65 at iNOS and hTERT promoters. Additionally, hTERT promoter-driven luciferase plasmids were transfected in to melanoma cells with indicated treatment to determine luciferase activity of hTERT.
RESULTS: Melatonin significantly and synergistically enhanced vemurafenib-mediated inhibitions of proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion and promoted vemurafenib-induced apoptosis, cell cycle arresting and stemness weakening in melanoma cells. Further mechanism study revealed that melatonin enhanced the antitumor effect of vemurafenib by abrogating nucleus translocation of NF-κB p50/p65 and their binding at iNOS and hTERT promoters, thereby suppressing the expression of iNOS and hTERT. The elevated anti-tumor capacity of vemurafenib upon co-treatment with melatonin was also evaluated and confirmed in mice with melanoma xenografts.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our results demonstrate melatonin synergizes the antitumor effect of vemurafenib in human melanoma by inhibiting cell proliferation and cancer-stem cell traits via targeting NF-κB/iNOS/hTERT signaling pathway, and suggest the potential of melatonin in antagonizing the toxicity of vemurafenib and augmenting its sensitivities in melanoma treatment.",J.

30717708,Impact of in vitro driven expression signatures of CD133 stem cell marker and tumor stroma on clinical outcomes in gastric cancers.,"BACKGROUND: The CD133 transmembrane protein is a well-recognized stem cell marker that has been used to isolate putative cancer stem cell populations from gastric cancers (GCs). However, the molecular features or biomarkers underlying CD133 are largely unknown in GCs.
METHODS: We performed gene expression profiling of CD133+ and CD133- cells sorted by flow cytometry from three GC cell lines to identify the CD133 expression signatures of GC. The CD133 expression signatures were investigated across publicly available expression profiles of multiple tumor types including GC and also for their relationship with patient survival.
RESULTS: The CD133 signature genes defined as 177 upregulated genes and 129 downregulated genes in CD133+ cells compared to CD133- cells were enriched with genes involving the cell cycle and cytoskeleton, implying that cancer stem cells with unlimited self-renewal play cancer-initiating roles. The CD133 expression signatures in GC expression profiles were positively correlated with those of brain tumors expressing CD133 and human embryonic stem cells, emphasizing the transcriptional similarities across stem cell-related expression signatures. We also found that these stem cell expression signatures were inversely correlated with those representing tumor infiltrating immune and stromal cells. Additionally, high CD133 expression signatures were found in intestinal subtypes and low tumor stage GCs as well as in those with microsatellite instabilities and high mutation burdens. As examined across 20 additional tumor types, both the expression signatures representing CD133 and stromal cells were unfavorable prognostic features; however, their impact were variable across tumor types.
CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptional activities of CD133 and those of stromal cells representing the activity of stem cells and level of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, respectively, may be inversely correlated with each other across multiple tumor types including GC. This relationship may be a confounding factor and should therefore be considered when evaluating the clinical relevance of stem cell-related markers.",BMC Cancer,2019,"['Kim TM', 'Ko YH', 'Ha SJ', 'Lee HH']",
30714183,Zinc promotes prostate cancer cell chemosensitivity to paclitaxel by inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition and inducing apoptosis.,"BACKGROUND: Paclitaxel (PTX) is a first-line chemotherapeutic drug for the treatment of prostate cancer. However, most patients develop resistance and metastasis, and thus new therapeutic approaches are urgently required. Recent studies have identified widespread anti-tumor effects of zinc (Zn) in various tumor cell lines, especially prostate cancer cells. In this study, we examined the effects of Zn as an adjuvant to PTX in prostate cancer cells.
METHODS: PC3 and DU145 cells were treated with different concentrations of Zn and/or PTX. MTT assay was used to detect cell viability. Real-time cell analysis (RTCA) and microscopy were used to observe morphological changes in cells. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins. qPCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) was used to examine changes in TWIST1 mRNA levels. Cell invasion and migration were detected by scratch and transwell assays. shRNA against TWIST1 was used to knockdown TWIST1. Colony formation assay was used to detect cell proliferation, while Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining was used to detect cell apoptosis.
RESULTS: Zn and PTX increased proliferation inhibition in a dose- and time-dependent manner in prostate cancer cells, while Zn increased prostate cancer cell chemosensitivity to PTX. Combined Zn and PTX inhibited prostate cancer cell invasion and migration by downregulating the expression of TWIST1. Furthermore, knockdown of TWIST1 increased the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to PTX. In addition, Zn and PTX reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that Zn and PTX combined therapy inhibits EMT by reducing the expression of TWIST1, which reduces the invasion and migration of prostate cancer cells. SiTWIST1 increased the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to PTX. In addition, with prolonged treatment, Zn and PTX inhibited proliferation and led to prostate cancer cell apoptosis. Therefore, Zn may be a potential adjuvant of PTX in treating prostate cancer and combined treatment may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer.",Prostate,2019,"['Xue YN', 'Yu BB', 'Liu YN', 'Guo R', 'Li JL', 'Zhang LC', 'Su J', 'Sun LK', 'Li Y']",

This article discusses how methods of reprogramming cancer cells to primitive cancer cell states, such as transcription factor reprogramming, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), conditional reprogramming, and hypoxia, may approach the CSC state and thus be relevant for drug screening purposes. This leads to the importance of recapitulating the stem cell niche in drug assays, which is enabled by recent advances in cell culture and tissue engineering. With the advent of these technologies, this article addresses the question of whether the stem cell phenotype should be targeted for drug screening.",Trends Pharmacol. Sci.,2019,['Wan ACA'],
30709379,GSK-3β regulates the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition via reciprocal crosstalk between NSCLC cells and HUVECs in multicellular tumor spheroid models.,"BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy used for patients with unresectable lung tumors remains largely palliative due to chemoresistance, which may be due to tumor heterogeneity. Recently, multiple studies on the crosstalk between lung cancer cells and their tumor microenvironment (TME) have been conducted to understand and overcome chemoresistance in lung cancer.
METHODS: In this study, we investigated the effect of reciprocal crosstalk between lung cancer cells and vascular endothelial cells using multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTSs) containing lung cancer cells and HUVECs.
RESULTS: Secretomes from lung cancer spheroids significantly triggered the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) process in HUVECs, compared to secretomes from monolayer-cultured lung cancer cells. Interestingly, expression of GSK-3β-targeted genes was altered in MCTSs and inhibition of this activity by a GSK-3β inhibitor induced reversion of EndMT in lung tumor microenvironments. Furthermore, we observed that HUVECs in MCTSs significantly increased the compactness of the spheroids and exhibited strong resistance against Gefitinib and Cisplatin, relative to fibroblasts, by facilitating the EndMT process in HUVECs. Subsequently, EndMT reversion contributed to control of chemoresistance, regardless of the levels of soluble transforming growth factor (TGF)-β. Using the MCTS xenograft mouse model, we demonstrated that inhibition of GSK-3β reduces lung cancer volume, and in combination with Gefitinib, has a synergistic effect on lung cancer therapy.
CONCLUSION: In summary, these findings suggest that targeting EndMT through GSK-3β inhibition in HUVECs might represent a promising therapeutic strategy for lung cancer therapy.",J. Exp. Clin. Cancer Res.,2019,"['Kim SH', 'Song Y', 'Seo HR']",

Stereotactic body radiation therapy preclinical modeling is now possible, and our aim was to develop a model of focal irradiation of the mouse lung and to investigate the impact of conditional hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) deletion in the endothelium on radiation-induced tissue damage.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: The Small Animal Radiation Research Platform was used to create a mouse model of focal irradiation of the lung using arc therapy. HIF-1α conditional deletion was obtained by crossing mice expressing Cre recombinase under the endothelial promoter VE-cadherin (VECad-Cre
RESULTS: Lung stereotactic arc therapy allows thoracic wall sparing and long-term studies. However, isodose curves showed that neighboring organs received significant doses of radiation, as revealed by ipsilateral lung acute red hepatization and major gene expression level modifications. Conditional HIF-1α deletion reduced acute lung edema and tended to diminish neutrophil infiltrate, but it had no impact on long-term global tissue damage.
CONCLUSIONS: Arc therapy for focal high-dose irradiation of mouse lung is an efficient model for long-term studies.

30696080,Novel Gastric Cancer Stem Cell-Related Marker LINGO2 Is Associated with Cancer Cell Phenotype and Patient Outcome.,"The expression of leucine-rich repeat and immunoglobulin-like domain-containing nogo receptor-interacting protein 2 (LINGO2) has been reported in Parkinson's disease; however, its role in other diseases is unknown. Gastric cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death. Cancer stem cells (CSC) are a subpopulation of cancer cells that contribute to the initiation and invasion of cancer. We identified LINGO2 as a CSC-associated protein in gastric cancers both in vitro and in patient-derived tissues. We studied the effect of LINGO2 on cell motility, stemness, tumorigenicity, and angiogenic capacity using cells sorted based on LINGO2 expression and LINGO2-silenced cells. Tissue microarray analysis showed that LINGO2 expression was significantly elevated in advanced gastric cancers. The overall survival of patients expressing high LINGO2 was significantly shorter than that of patients with low LINGO2. Cells expressing high LINGO2 showed elevated cell motility, angiogenic capacity, and tumorigenicity, while LINGO2 silencing reversed these properties. Silencing LINGO2 reduced kinase B (AKT)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/ERK kinase (MEK) phosphorylation and decreased epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated markers-N-Cadherin and Vimentin and stemness-associated markers- POU class 5 homeobox 1 (OCT4) and Indian hedgehog (IHH), and markedly decreased the CD44⁺ population. These indicate the involvement of LINGO2 in gastric cancer initiation and progression by altering cell motility, stemness, and tumorigenicity, suggesting LINGO2 as a putative target for gastric cancer treatment.",Int J Mol Sci,2019,"['Jo JH', 'Park SB', 'Park S', 'Lee HS', 'Kim C', 'Jung DE', 'Song SY']",

The level of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related markers was analyzed by immunofluorescent staining. RESULTS GOLM1 was overexpressed in BC cell lines and tissues. Overexpression of GOLM1 induced EMT and promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion of BC cells. Furthermore, overexpressing of GOLM1 markedly promoted the tumorigenicity and metastasis of BC cells in vivo, whereas knock-down of GOLM1 caused the opposite outcomes. Furthermore, we proved that GOLM1 promoted BC cell aggressiveness by regulating matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP13).

30692635,TGFβ promotes breast cancer stem cell self-renewal through an ILEI/LIFR signaling axis.,"FAM3C/Interleukin-like EMT Inducer (ILEI) is an oncogenic member of the FAM3 cytokine family and serves essential roles in both epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and breast cancer metastasis. ILEI expression levels are regulated through a non-canonical TGFβ signaling pathway by 3'-UTR-mediated translational silencing at the mRNA level by hnRNP E1. TGFβ stimulation or silencing of hnRNP E1 increases ILEI translation and induces an EMT program that correlates with enhanced invasion and migration. Recently, EMT has been linked to the formation of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) that confer both tumor cell heterogeneity as well as chemoresistant properties. Herein, we demonstrate that hnRNP E1 knockdown significantly shifts normal mammary epithelial cells to mesenchymal BCSCs in vitro and in vivo. We further validate that modulating ILEI protein levels results in the abrogation of these phenotypes, promoting further investigation into the unknown mechanism of ILEI signaling that drives tumor progression. We identify LIFR as the receptor for ILEI, which mediates signaling through STAT3 to drive both EMT and BCSC formation. Reduction of either ILEI or LIFR protein levels results in reduced tumor growth, fewer tumor initiating cells and reduced metastasis within the hnRNP E1 knock-down cell populations in vivo. These results reveal a novel ligand-receptor complex that drives the formation of BCSCs and represents a unique target for the development of metastatic breast cancer therapies.",Oncogene,2019,"['Woosley AN', 'Dalton AC', 'Hussey GS', 'Howley BV', 'Mohanty BK', 'Grelet S', 'Dincman T', 'Bloos S', 'Olsen SK', 'Howe PH']",

METHODS: The baseline expressions of MTBP in 3 different human prostate cancer cells lines (22RV1, DU145 and Lncap) were detected using Western blotting. The cells were transfected with a small interfering RNA (siRNA) for MTBP knockdown or MTBP plasmid for MTBP overexpression, and 48 h later, the cells were examined for MTBP expression with Western blotting; the changes in the migration abilities of the cells were evaluated using wound healing assay and Transwell assay, and the cell invasiveness was assessed using Matrigel Transwell assay. The expression of E-cadherin protein, a marker of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), was detected using Western blotting.
RESULTS: MTBP expression was the highest in DU145 cells followed by Lncap cells, and was the lowest in 22RV1 cells, indicating a positive correlation of MTBP expression with the level of malignancy of human prostate cancer cells. Transfection of the cells with siRNA or MTBP plasmids efficiently lowered or enhanced the expressions of MTBP in human prostate cancer cells.

30691517,Knockdown of FOXO3a induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition and promotes metastasis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma by activation of the β-catenin/TCF4 pathway through SPRY2.,"BACKGROUND: Early invasion and metastasis are responsible for the dismal prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is recognized as a crucial biological progress in driving tumor invasion and metastasis. The transcription factor FOXO3a is inactivated in various types of solid cancers and the loss of FOXO3a is associated with EMT and tumor metastasis. In this study, we sought to explore whether SPRY2, a regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, is involved in FOXO3a-mediated EMT and metastasis in PDAC.
METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was performed in 130 paired PDAC tissues and paracarcinomatous pancreatic tissues. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed by cell counting kit and flow cytometry, while cell migration and invasion were evaluated with wound healing and transwell assays. The changes in mRNA and protein levels were estimated by qRT-PCR and western blot. BALB/c nude mice xenograft model was established to evaluate tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo.
RESULTS: FOXO3a expression was remarkably reduced in PDAC tissues, and correlated with metastasis-associated clinicopathologic characteristics and poor prognosis in patients with PDAC. In addition to the promotion of proliferation and suppression of apoptosis, knockdown of FOXO3a or SPRY2 induced EMT and promoted the migration and invasion of PDAC cells via activation of the β-catenin/TCF4 pathway. Moreover, silencing of SPRY2 reversed the suppressor effects induced by FOXO3a overexpression on EMT-associated migration and invasion of PDAC cells, while blockade of β-catenin reversed the effects of SPRY2 loss. FOXO3a knockdown decreased SPRY2 protein stability, whereas SPRY2 knockdown enhanced β-catenin protein stability. In vivo, FOXO3a knockdown promoted the tumorigenic ability and metastasis of PDAC cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that knockdown of FOXO3a induces EMT and promotes metastasis of PDAC by activation of the β-catenin/TCF4 pathway through SPRY2.

30691509,Tobacco smoke induced hepatic cancer stem cell-like properties through IL-33/p38 pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoke (TS) critically contributes to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) induced by TS is an early event in the initiation of carcinogenesis. Tumor specific microenvironment including inflammatory factors is key mediator for maintaining the stemness of CSCs through various pathways such as p38 MAPK. However, the mechanisms of inflammatory factors in TS-induced acquisition of liver CSCs properties remain undefined. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of IL-33/p38 axis in long term TS-induced acquisition of hepatic CSCs properties in mouse liver tissues and human liver cells.
METHODS: BALB/c mice were exposed to TS for 12 weeks, along with or without 1 mg/kg SB203580 (p38 inhibitors) treatment. Histopathological analysis, alterations in the levels of IL-33, liver CSCs markers, EMT-like changes and p38 MAPK activation in liver tissues of mice were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining, immunofluorescence assay and Western blot analysis. Moreover, LO2 immortalized human liver cells were exposed to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and the tumorsphere formation ability was determined. LO2 cells were further treated with IL-33 or CSE and the expression of phosphorylated p38, liver CSCs markers and EMT-related proteins was examined.
RESULTS: Long term TS exposure increased the levels of CSCs markers, induced epithelial-to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and inflammatory factor IL-33 expression. Moreover, we showed that p38 MAPK modulated TS-stimulated hepatic CSC-like properties, as evidenced by the findings that long term TS exposure activated p38, and that TS-induced stemness was abolished by p38 inhibition. In addition, data from in vitro model showed that similar to cigarette smoke extract (CSE), IL-33 treatment promoted the activation of p38, increased the levels of liver CSCs markers expression and EMT-like changes.

Hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), the core element in generating the hypoxia response, induces invasion and metastasis by promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This study explored the underlying mechanism of hypoxia associated with the invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer (GC).
METHODS: Six methods were employed to assess the function of the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) prostate cancer gene expression marker 1 (PCGEM1) including gene silencing, RT-PCR, the separation of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, scrape motility assay, transwell migration assay, and Western-blot.
RESULTS: LncRNA PCGEM1 was overexpressed in GC cells and tissues, and was induced by hypoxia in GC cells. Additional experiments confirmed that the knockdown of PCGEM1 significantly repressed the invasion and metastasis of GC cells. SNAI1, a key transcription factor of EMT, was regulated by PCGEM1. Overexpression of SNAI1 rescued the inhibition of PCGEM1-knockdown during the invasion and metastasis of GC cells. In addition, PCGEM1 and SNAI1 jointly affected the biomarkers of EMT.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that PCGEM1 is a hypoxia-responsive lncRNA, and contributes to the invasion and metastasis of GC.

Finally, the tumoral expression of VEGF was measured by immunohistochemistry, and the expression of Ki67, PCNA, β-catenin, c-Myc, Cyclin D1, MMP2 and MMP7 was measured by Western blot analysis.
RESULTS: EST inhibited HCT-116 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot analysis revealed that EST decreased the expression of Ki67, PCNA, N-cadherin, E-cadherin, vimentin, fibronectin, β-catenin, c-Myc, Cyclin D1, MMP2 and MMP7. Furthermore, EST reduced the release of Wnt3a and VEGF into HCT-116 cells culture medium. After EST treatment, the tumor volume was significant smaller than that of the control group, and the tumoral levels of VEGF were decreased. Moreover, western blot analysis indicated that the expression of Ki67, PCNA, β-catenin, c-Myc, Cyclin D1, MMP2 and MMP7 were also significantly decreased after treated with EST. In addition, in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor results demonstrated that EST combined with 5-FU could increase the inhibitory effect of 5-FU on HCT-116 cells proliferation, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.
CONCLUSIONS: EST enhances the inhibitory effect of 5-FU on the proliferation, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of CRC.",Cancer Biomark,2019,"['Yan L', 'Yu HH', 'Liu YS', 'Wang YS', 'Zhao WH']",

MATERIAL AND METHODS Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect expression of TRIM55 in tissues samples of HCC patients. Transwell assay was used to study migration and invasion ability of HCC cells. Western blot and immunofluorescence (IF) were used to analyze mechanism of TRIM55 in cell migration and invasion. RESULTS We found TRIM55 was downregulated in HCC tissues and was associated with prognosis of HCC patients. Cox regression analysis showed that TRIM55 was an independent risk factor of prognosis of HCC patients. Overexpression of TRIM55 was associated with lower cell migration and invasion ability, and it led to high expression of E-cadherin and low expression of Vimentin and MMP2. CONCLUSIONS Our study found TRIM55 is an independent factor affecting the prognosis of HCC patients, and overexpression of TRIM55 inhibits migration and invasion of HCC cells through epithelial-mesenchymal transition and MMP2.",Med.

30684967,Aberrant methylation and downregulation of ZNF667-AS1 and ZNF667 promote the malignant progression of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: Dysregulated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the development of tumor. Aberrant methylation is one of the most frequent epigenetic alterations that regulate the expression of genes. The aim of this study was to determine the expression and methylation status of ZNF667-AS1 and ZNF667, elucidate their biological function in the development of LSCC, and identify a cis-regulation of ZNF667-AS1 to ZNF667.
METHODS: The expression and methylation status of ZNF667-AS1 and ZNF667 in laryngeal cancer cell lines and LSCC samples were tested respectively. The function of two laryngeal cancer cell lines with overexpression of ZNF667-AS1 or ZNF667 was detected. The regulation between ZNF667-AS1 and ZNF667 was determined.
RESULTS: Significant downregulation of ZNF667-AS1 was detected in laryngeal cancer cell lines and LSCC tumor tissues. The reduced expression of ZNF667-AS1 was associated with moderate/poor pathological differentiation of LSCC tumor tissues. Aberrant hypermethylation of the CpG sites of ZNF667-AS1, closing to the transcriptional start site (TSS), was more critical for gene silencing, and associated with moderate/poor pathological differentiation. In vitro hypermethylation of promoter region closing to TSS of ZNF667-AS1 decreased the luciferase reporter activity. Overexpression of ZNF667-AS1 reduced the proliferation, migration, and invasion ability of AMC-HN-8 and TU177 cells. The sense strand, ZNF667, was positively correlated with ZNF667-AS1 in expression and function. Overexpression of ZNF667-AS1 led to increased expression of ZNF667 in mRNA and protein level. ZNF667-AS1 and ZNF667 may be associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process.
CONCLUSIONS: ZNF667-AS1 and ZNF667 are both down-regulated by hypermethylation, and they serve as tumor suppressor genes in LSCC. ZNF667-AS1 regulates the expression of ZNF667 in cis.",J. Biomed. Sci.,2019,"['Meng W', 'Cui W', 'Zhao L', 'Chi W', 'Cao H', 'Wang B']",

We investigated miRNA fingerprints in four subgroups: mild (ESM) and aggressive (ESA) ES and ocular SCC (oSCC) and genital SCC (gSCC). Three tumours and three control samples were included in each of the four subgroups. Following next generation sequencing, miRNA differential expression analysis using DESeq2 was carried out. Pathways associated with the human mature homologues of identified dysregulated miRNAs were predicted using DIANA- miRPath v3.0. When comparing tumour vs control tissue, 57 miRNAs in ESM, six in ESA, 47 in oSCC and zero in gSCC were found to be differentially expressed and may thus serve as potential diagnostic tissue biomarkers. Whereas, ES lesions in general were associated with downregulation of the miR-200 family, which may trigger epithelial-mesenchymal transition, ESM lesions were associated with upregulation of the proposed tumour-suppressive miRNA cluster on equine chromosome 24. In contrast, the oSCC tumours showed downregulation of this cluster as well as downregulation of the miR-34 family, which may favour oSCC tumour cell metabolism. To further validate the proposed diagnostic miRNA fingerprints and their suggested biological effects, further miRNA studies need to be carried out in larger study cohorts.",Vet Comp Oncol,2019,"['Bogedale K', 'Jagannathan V', 'Gerber V', 'Unger L']",

More than 90% of cancer patients died from tumor metastasis, instead of primary tumor growth. The canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway plays essential roles in promoting tumor formation, yet its function in regulating tumor metastasis and the underlying mechanisms remain controversial. Here we employed well-established Drosophila tumor models to investigate the regulating mechanism of Wingless (Wg) pathway in tumor invasion.

METHODS: The correlations between claudin-1 expression and clinicopathological characteristics, including survival rates, were assessed using immunohistochemistry on 260 archival, paraffin-embedded CRC tissues. In addition, the correlations between cludin-1 and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were investigated.
RESULTS: Claudin-1 expression was markedly lost in 42.7% of the 260 CRCs analyzed. Loss of claudin-1 expression significantly correlated with larger tumor size, vascular invasion, higher pT stage, and high metastatic lymph node ratio. In addition, loss of claudin-1 expression significantly correlated with NF-κB activation (P < 0.001), high SNAI (P < 0.001), and low E-cadherin (P < 0.001) expressions. Patients with high immunoscores showed significantly lower rates of claudin-1 expression loss (P = 0.020). In detail, loss of claudin-1 expression were frequently found in CRCs low CD3- and CD8-positive lymphocytes. There were significant correlations between claudin-1 expression loss and poor overall and recurrence-free survivals (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results suggest that the loss of claudin-1 expression significantly correlates with aggressive tumor behaviors, high SNAI expression, lower immunoscore, and poor prognoses.",Pathol. Res. Pract.,2019,"['Kim NY', 'Pyo JS', 'Kang DW', 'Yoo SM']",

However, the expression level and clinicopathological significance of FAM3C in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has not been thoroughly elucidated to date. We performed immunohistochemical staining on human OSCC specimens with FAM3C, co-inhibitory immune checkpoints, EMT markers, and cancer stem cells (CSCs) markers to analyze the expression levels and clinicopathological features of FAM3C in OSCC. There were 210 primary OSCC specimens, 69 oral epithelial dysplasia and 42 normal oral mucosae in our human OSCC tissue microarrays cohort. We observed that FAM3C expression was upregulated in OSCC compared with normal mucosa and epithelial dysplasia (P <  0.001). Moreover, patients with higher FAM3C expression levels had a worse prognosis than those with lower expression levels (P < 0.05). Also, FAM3C expression was positively correlated with the immune checkpoints PD-L1, VISTA, and B7-H4, the EMT marker Slug and the CSC markers SOX2 and ALDH1.

Recent researches have reported that microRNA-150-5p (miR-150-5p) is up-regulated in diverse carcinomas containing cervical carcinoma. The purpose of this study was to further investigate the potential role of miR-150-5p in the progress of cervical carcinoma cells including proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).The ability of miR-150-5p to promote carcinogenesis was analyzed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot assays, respectively. Bioinformatics analyses predicted and identified whether SRC kinase signaling inhibitor 1 (SRCIN1) was served as a potential target of miR-150-5p. C-33A and HeLa cells were utilized to determine the function of miR-150-5p through targeting SRCIN1. Among the aberrantly expressed miRNAs, miR-150-5p was significantly revealed differential expression in cervical carcinoma cell lines and was closely relevant to cell growth regulation. Furthermore, we found that SRCIN1 overexpression could obviously inhibit the proliferation and EMT of cervical cancer cells triggered by miR-150-5p mimics as well as accelerated the apoptosis of cervical carcinoma cells. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that miR-150-5p could promote the proliferation and EMT of cervical carcinoma cells via targeting SRCIN1.

However, the mechanism underlying tumor development and progression due to aberrant FZD2 expression is poorly defined. Here, we provide evidence that FZD2 is a driver for EMT, cancer stem cell properties, and vasculogenic mimicry (VM) in HCC. We found that FZD2 was highly expressed in two cohorts of Chinese hepatitis B virus-related HCC patients, and that high FZD2 expression was associated with poor prognosis. Concerning the mechanism, gain- and loss-of-function experiments showed the oncogenic action of FZD2 in HCC cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. Further investigations in vitro and in vivo suggested that FZD2 promotes the EMT process, enhances stem-like properties, and confers VM capacity to HCC cells. Notably, integrative RNA sequencing analysis of FZD2-knockdown cells indicated the enrichment of Hippo signaling pathway. Taken together, our data suggest for the first time that FZD2 could promote clinically relevant EMT, CD44",Cancer Sci.,2019,"['Ou H', 'Chen Z', 'Xiang L', 'Fang Y', 'Xu Y', 'Liu Q', 'Hu Z', 'Li X', 'Huang Y', 'Yang D']",
30677079,Deletion of the p16INK4a tumor suppressor and expression of the androgen receptor induce sarcomatoid carcinomas with signet ring cells in the mouse prostate.,"The tumor suppressor p16Ink4a, encoded by the INK4a gene, is an inhibitor of cyclin D-dependent kinases 4 and 6, CDK4 and CDK6. This inhibition prevents the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), resulting in cellular senescence through inhibition of E2F-mediated transcription of S phase genes required for cell proliferation. The p16Ink4a plays an important role in tumor suppression, whereby its deletion, mutation, or epigenetic silencing is a frequently observed genetic alteration in prostate cancer. To assess its roles and related molecular mechanisms in prostate cancer initiation and progression, we generated a mouse model with conditional deletion of p16Ink4a in prostatic luminal epithelium. The mice underwent oncogenic transformation and developed prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) from eight months of age, but failed to develop prostatic tumors. Given the prevalence of aberrant androgen signaling pathways in prostate cancer initiation and progression, we then generated R26hARL/wt:p16L/L: PB-Cre4 compound mice, in which conditional expression of the human AR transgene and deletion of p16Ink4a co-occur in prostatic luminal epithelial cells. While R26hARL/wt:PB-Cre4 mice showed no visible pathological changes, R26hARL/wt:p16L/L: PB-Cre4 compound mice displayed an early onset of high-grade PIN (HGPIN), prostatic carcinoma, and metastatic lesions. Strikingly, we observed tumors resembling human sarcomatoid carcinoma with intermixed focal regions of signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) in the prostates of the compound mice. Further characterization of these tumors showed they were of luminal epithelial cell origin, and featured characteristics of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) with enhanced proliferative and invasive capabilities.

This study was designed to investigate the mechanism of HOXB8 regulating colorectal cancer cell proliferation and invasion in vivo and in vitro. MATERIAL AND METHODS HOXB8 shRNA, HOXB8 overexpression, and negative control vector were designed and stably transfected into HCT116 cells. MTT assays were performed to detect cell proliferation. Western blot was utilized to detect HOXB8 expression level in HCT116 stable cells. The invasive and migration abilities were detected by Transwell assay and wound-healing assay. RESULTS HOXB8 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation. The invasiveness of HCT116 cells was significantly reduced following HOXB8 depletion compared with that in the shRNA control group, whereby the rates were reduced by 67% in HOXB8 knockdown group. The wound-healing rate of HOXB8 over-expression cells was significantly increased comparing with that of cells in the blank control group (P<0.05). HOXB8 knockdown promotes apoptosis of HCT116 cells. The expression of E-cadherin was restrained in the HOXB8 over-expression group and increased in the HOXB8 knockdown group. CONCLUSIONS Knock-down of HOXB8 prohibits the proliferation and migration of colorectal cancer cells via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and the downregulation of various factors, such as MMP2, c-Myc, CyclinD1,and vimentin.

Breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 were transfected with shRNA (short hairpin RNA) that specifically targeting HOTTIP. We observed a remarkable decrease in migration and invasiveness in these two breast cancer cell lines after knock-down of HOTTIP by shHOTTIP. We also demonstrated that the EMT of these two breast cell lines was suppressed after HOTTIP knock-down, as evidenced by increased E-cadherin levels, and decreased levels of N-cadherin, Snail, and Twist. Moreover, HOTTIP silencing also suppressed tumor metastasis in nude mice in vivo. In addition, we found that the expression of β-catenin was significantly decreased in breast cancer cells after knock-down of HOTTIP. In a further rescue experiment using overexpression of β-catenin, the rates of cell migration, invasiveness, and EMT of HOTTIP-silenced breast cancer cells were promoted, disclosing a potential role of the Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway in this process.

Cav-1 expression was significantly lower in tumorspheres than in adherent cells. The silencing of Cav-1 enhanced stemness of MDA-MB-231 cells. Mechanistically, Cav-1 silencing was accompanied by enhanced expression of Bmi-1, which is a representative self-renewal regulator, and promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In a CSC-like state, reduced Cav-1 depends on its destabilization through ubiquitin-proteasome degradation. We further found that Src-mediated phosphorylation of Cav-1 at the Tyr 14 residue is essential for its degradation.

30671168,Oncogenic Metabolism Acts as a Prerequisite Step for Induction of Cancer Metastasis and Cancer Stem Cell Phenotype.,"Metastasis is a major obstacle to the efficient and successful treatment of cancer. Initiation of metastasis requires epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that is regulated by several transcription factors, including Snail and ZEB1/2. EMT is closely linked to the acquisition of cancer stem cell (CSC) properties and chemoresistance, which contribute to tumor malignancy. Tumor suppressor p53 inhibits EMT and metastasis by negatively regulating several EMT-inducing transcription factors and regulatory molecules; thus, its inhibition is crucial in EMT, invasion, metastasis, and stemness. Metabolic alterations are another hallmark of cancer. Most cancer cells are more dependent on glycolysis than on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation for their energy production, even in the presence of oxygen. Cancer cells enhance other oncogenic metabolic pathways, such as glutamine metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway, and the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol. Metabolic reprogramming in cancer is regulated by the activation of oncogenes or loss of tumor suppressors that contribute to tumor progression. Oncogenic metabolism has been recently linked closely with the induction of EMT or CSC phenotypes by the induction of several metabolic enzyme genes.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are known to contribute to poor outcome by conferring therapy resistance to various cancer types, but this has not been explored in EAC. Importantly, a targeted strategy to circumvent CAF-induced resistance has yet to be identified. By using EAC patient-derived CAFs, organoid cultures, and xenograft models we identified IL-6 as the stromal driver of therapy resistance in EAC. IL-6 activated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in cancer cells, which was accompanied by enhanced treatment resistance, migratory capacity, and clonogenicity. Inhibition of IL-6 restored drug sensitivity in patient-derived organoid cultures and cell lines. Analysis of patient gene expression profiles identified ADAM12 as a noninflammation-related serum-borne marker for IL-6-producing CAFs, and serum levels of this marker predicted unfavorable responses to neoadjuvant chemoradiation in EAC patients.

Although microRNA (miR)-506-3p has been demonstrated to act as a tumor suppressor in OS, its role in regulating the EMT process and autophagy remains unknown. The results showed that miR-506-3p directly inhibited the expression of sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) in 143B and SaOS-2 cells. The invasive capability of OS cells was reduced following miR-506-3p mimics transfection, and restored when SPHK1 was overexpressed simultaneously. Further, miR-506-3p mimics initiated mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) - E-cadherin expression was upregulated, whilst vimentin and fibronectin were downregulated. The basal autophagy flux (LC3II/I) was suppressed by miR-506-3p mimics. The alterations induced by miR-506-3p mimics were partly reversed by SPHK1 overexpression or treatment of rapamycin.

30668428,p73 induction by Abrus agglutinin facilitates Snail ubiquitination to inhibit epithelial to mesenchymal transition in oral cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key step in oral cancer progression, is associated with invasion, metastasis, and therapy resistance, thus targeting the EMT represents a critical therapeutic strategy for the treatment of oral cancer metastasis. Our previous study showed that Abrus agglutinin (AGG), a plant lectin, induces both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis to activate the tumor inhibitory mechanism.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the role of AGG in modulating invasiveness and stemness through EMT inhibition for the development of antineoplastic agents against oral cancer.
METHODS: The EMT- and stemness-related proteins were studied in oral cancer cells using Western blot analysis and fluorescence microscopy. The potential mechanisms of Snail downregulation through p73 activation in FaDu cells were evaluated using Western blot analysis, immunoprecipitation, confocal microscopy, and molecular docking analysis. Immunohistochemical staining of the tumor samples of AGG-treated FaDu-xenografted nude mice was performed.
RESULTS: At the molecular level, AGG-induced p73 suppressed Snail expression, leading to EMT inhibition in FaDu cells. Notably, AGG promoted the translocation of Snail from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in FaDu cells and triggered its degradation through ubiquitination. In this setting, AGG inhibited the interaction between Snail and p73 in FaDu cells, resulting in p73 activation and EMT inhibition. Moreover, in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated FaDu cells, AGG abolished the upregulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 that plays a pivotal role in the upregulation of Snail to regulate the EMT phenotypes. In immunohistochemistry analysis, FaDu xenografts from AGG-treated mice showed decreased expression of Snail, SOX2, and vimentin and increased expression of p73 and E-cadherin compared with the control group, confirming EMT inhibition as part of its anticancer efficacy against oral cancer.

Studies have shown that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical step in tumor progression and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) signaling has been shown to play a crucial role in EMT. Here, we investigate the inhibition effect of Ginsenoside Rb2, main bioactive component of ginseng, in human colorectal cancer cells via TGF-β1.
PURPOSE: The current study aims to study the inhibitory effect of Ginsenoside Rb2 on HCT116 and SW620 cells and its anti-tumor mechanism.
METHODS: Histomorphological analysis and western blot analysis were performed to evaluate expression of TGF-β1 in human cancerous colon samples and the adjacent normal samples. The docking simulation assay were performed to explore the potential mode of binding of Ginsenoside Rb2 to the TGF-β1 protein. CCK8, adhesion and invasion assay were used to assess the effects of Ginsenoside Rb2 in HCT116 and SW620 cells. RT-PCR, Western blot and Immunohistochemical staining were employed to detect the TGF-β1-related signaling pathways in the colon cancer cells and/or xenograft mice.
RESULTS: The expression of TGF-β1 in human cancerous colon samples was significantly increased compared with the adjacent normal samples. Ginsenoside Rb2 inhibit the growth, adhesion, EMT and metastasis of human colorectal cancer cells. The docking simulation assay confirmed that Ginsenoside Rb2 bound to the hydrophobic pocket of TGF-β1, which partially overlaps with the binding sites on TGF-β1, and thus disrupted TGF-β1 dimerization. Western Blot analysis further confirmed that Ginsenoside Rb2 could inhibit the expression of TGF-β1 in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, Ginsenoside Rb2 could inhibit the expression of Smad4 and phosphorylated Smad2/3.

Recently, MIF was detected in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC). However, its functional effect in perineural invasion (PNI) of SACC remained unknown. To illuminate the effect of MIF in genesis of PNI in SACC, we examined the expression of MIF, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related markers, and Schwann cell markers by immunohistochemical analysis in 158 cases of SACC samples. Meanwhile, the correlation between MIF and PNI of SACC species was analyzed. Our data indicated that MIF expression was associated with PNI of SACC significantly. In vitro, the silence and overexpression experiments of MIF were performed in SACC cell lines. The ability of migration, invasion and PNI could be inhibited significantly by siRNA-mediated MIF silence, and the occurrence of EMT and Schwann-like cell differentiation was also inhibited by MIF silence in SACC-LM cells. Overexpression of MIF in SACC-83 cells using expressive plasmid showed the opposite effects. Our findings identified that an association between PNI and MIF expression existed. MIF may promote PNI of SACC by participating in cytoskeletal reorganization and pseudo foot formation induced by EMT and the Schwann-like cell differentiation of SACC cells.",Mol.

30664792,Snail-induced claudin-11 prompts collective migration for tumour progression.,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a pivotal mechanism for cancer dissemination. However, EMT-regulated individual cancer cell invasion is difficult to detect in clinical samples. Emerging evidence implies that EMT is correlated to collective cell migration and invasion with unknown mechanisms. We show that the EMT transcription factor Snail elicits collective migration in squamous cell carcinoma by inducing the expression of a tight junctional protein, claudin-11. Mechanistically, tyrosine-phosphorylated claudin-11 activates Src, which suppresses RhoA activity at intercellular junctions through p190RhoGAP, maintaining stable cell-cell contacts. In head and neck cancer patients, the Snail-claudin-11 axis prompts the formation of circulating tumour cell clusters, which correlate with tumour progression. Overexpression of snail correlates with increased claudin-11, and both are associated with a worse outcome. This finding extends the current understanding of EMT-mediated cellular migration via a non-individual type of movement to prompt cancer progression.",Nat.

30664186,Muscleblind‑like 1 destabilizes Snail mRNA and suppresses the metastasis of colorectal cancer cells via the Snail/E‑cadherin axis.,"RNA‑binding proteins (RBPs) play a fundamental role in the recurrence and metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we identified muscleblind‑like 1 (MBNL1), an RBP implicated in developmental control, as a robust suppressor of CRC cell metastasis in vitro. By using a scratch assay coupled with time‑lapse live cell imaging, our findings revealed that the knockdown of MBNL1 induced epithelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition (EMT)‑like morphological changes in the HCT‑116 cells, accompanied by an enhanced cell motility, and by the downregulation of E‑cadherin and the upregulation of Snail expression. By contrast, the ectopic overexpression of MBNL1 suppressed EMT, characterized by the upregulation of E‑cadherin and the downregulation of Snail expression. Mechanistically, Snail rather than E‑cadherin, was identified as a direct downstream target gene of MBNL1. The ectopic the overexpression of MBNL1 markedly enhanced the recruitment of Snail transcripts to processing bodies (P‑bodies), leading to the increased degradation of Snail mRNA and consequent translational silencing. Furthermore, the effect of MBNL1 on CRC cell migration was confirmed in additional CRC cell lines. SW480 and HT‑29 cells exhibited similar changes in migratory capacity and the expression of Snail/E‑cadherin to those observed in HCT‑116 cells. On the whole, this study demonstrates that MBNL1 destabilizes Snail transcripts and, in turn, suppresses the EMT of CRC cells through the Snail/E‑cadherin axis in vitro. Therefore, this EMT‑related MBNL1/Snail/E‑cadherin axis may prove to be a novel therapeutic target for CRC metastasis.",Int. J. Oncol.,2019,"['Tang L', 'Zhao P', 'Kong D']",

The present study demonstrated that miR‑3653 expression was significantly decreased in HCC tissues and cells using qRT‑PCR. A decreased miR‑3653 level was associated with unfavorable clinical features and poor prognosis of HCC patients. MTT, BrdU, Transwell and western blot assays showed that miR‑3653 overexpression inhibited the growth, migration, invasion and epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) of HCCLM3 cells while its knockdown promoted the growth and metastatic ability of Hep3B cells. In vivo experiments showed that miR‑3653 overexpression inhibited the subcutaneous and the lung metastasis of HCCLM3 cells in nude mice. Mechanistically, integrin‑β1 (ITGB1) was identified to be the downstream target of miR‑3653 in HCC.

Moreover, SULT2B1b interference suppressed the EMT and attenuated the migration and invasion abilities of human hepatocarcinoma BEL-7402 cells by inhibiting the activation of the β-catenin/MMP-7 pathway. In summary, SULT2B1b enhanced the EMT of hepatocytes and promoted the migration and invasion abilities of BEL-7402 cells by activing the β-catenin/MMP-7 pathway.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of women who underwent surgery for uterine mesenchymal tumors at our hospital.
RESULTS: Among 487 operated cases, 447 tumors occurred in the premenopausal period and 40 occurred in the postmenopausal period. Uterine sarcomas were observed in 5 cases (1.1%) during the premenopausal period and in 11 cases (28%) during the postmenopausal period. Among the postmenopausal patients, age, age at menopause, body mass index (BMI), tumor size, incidence of abnormal vaginal bleeding, serum tumor marker levels (cancer antigen 125, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, and carcinoembryonic antigen), and serum lactate dehydrogenase values were not significantly different between patients with benign tumors and those with malignant tumors. On the other hand, the incidence to have abnormal signal on MRI was significantly higher in patients with malignant tumors than in patients with benign tumors.
CONCLUSION: In our hospital, the incidence of malignant tumors in women with uterine corporeal mesenchymal tumors was much higher in postmenopausal patients than in premenopausal patients. Because it is generally not easy to diagnose uterine sarcomas before surgery, surgery should be positively considered when uterine sarcomas cannot be ruled out for patients in the postmenopausal period.",BMC Womens Health,2019,"['Ishidera Y', 'Yoshida H', 'Oi Y', 'Katayama K', 'Miyagi E', 'Hayashi H', 'Shigeta H']",
30657636,Metabolic reprogramming in breast cancer results in distinct mitochondrial bioenergetics between luminal and basal subtypes.,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is a key feature of cancer and is frequently associated with increased aggressiveness and metastatic potential. Recent evidence has brought to light a metabolic rewiring that takes place during the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that drives the invasive capability of malignant tumors, and highlights a mechanistic link between mitochondrial dysfunction and EMT that has been only partially investigated. In this study, we characterized mitochondrial function and bioenergetic status of cultured human breast cancer cell lines, including luminal-like and basal-like subtypes. Through a combination of biochemical and functional studies, we demonstrated that basal-like cell lines exhibit impaired, but not completely inactive, mitochondrial function, and rely on a consequent metabolic switch to glycolysis to support their ATP demand. These altered metabolic activities are linked to modifications of key electron transport chain proteins and a significant increase in levels of reactive oxygen species compared to luminal cells. Furthermore, we observed that the stable knockdown of EMT markers caused functional changes in mitochondria that result in acquisition of a hybrid glycolysis/OXPHOS phenotype in cancer cells as a means to sustain their metabolic demand.",FEBS J.,2019,"['Lunetti P', 'Di Giacomo M', 'Vergara D', 'De Domenico S', 'Maffia M', 'Zara V', 'Capobianco L', 'Ferramosca A']",
30657059,The functional role of integrins during intra- and extravasation within the metastatic cascade.,"Formation of distant metastases is by far the most common cause of cancer-related deaths. The process of metastasis formation is complex, and within this complex process the formation of migratory cells, the so called epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), which enables cancer cells to break loose from the primary tumor mass and to enter the bloodstream, is of particular importance. To break loose from the primary cancer, cancer cells have to down-regulate the cell-to-cell adhesion molecuIes (CAMs) which keep them attached to neighboring cancer cells. In contrast to this downregulation of CAMS in the primary tumor, cancer cells up-regulate other types of CAMs, that enable them to attach to the endothelium in the organ of the future metastasis. During EMT, the expression of cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix adhesion molecules and their down- and upregulation is therefore critical for metastasis formation. Tumor cells mimic leukocytes to enable transmigration of the endothelial barrier at the metastatic site. The attachment of leukocytes/cancer cells to the endothelium are mediated by several CAMs different from those at the site of the primary tumor. These CAMs and their ligands are organized in a sequential row, the leukocyte adhesion cascade. In this adhesion process, integrins and their ligands are centrally involved in the molecular interactions governing the transmigration. This review discusses the integrin expression patterns found on primary tumor cells and studies whether their expression correlates with tumor progression, metastatic capacity and prognosis. Simultaneously, further possible, but so far unclearly characterized, alternative adhesion molecules and/or ligands, will be considered and emerging therapeutic possibilities reviewed.",Mol.

Here, we have analyzed STK17A in colorectal cancer and demonstrated decreased expression of STK17A in primary tumors, which is further reduced in metastatic lesions, indicating a potential role in regulating the metastatic cascade.

30654768,"Podoplanin (PDPN) affects the invasiveness of thyroid carcinoma cells by inducing ezrin, radixin and moesin (E/R/M) phosphorylation in association with matrix metalloproteinases.","BACKGROUND: Podoplanin (PDPN) is a mucin-type transmembrane glycoprotein specific to the lymphatic system. PDPN expression has been found in various human tumors and is considered to be a marker of cancer. We had previously shown that PDPN expression contributes to carcinogenesis in the TPC1 papillary thyroid cancer-derived cell line by enhancing cell migration and invasiveness. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of PDPN down-regulation in another thyroid cancer-derived cell line: BcPAP.
METHODS: In order to determine the effects of PDPN on malignant features of BcPAP cells (harboring the BRAFV600E mutated allele) and TPC1 cells (carrying the RET/PTC1 rearrangement), we silenced PDPN in these cells using small interfering RNA (siRNA). The efficacy of PDPN silencing was confirmed by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Then, we tested the motility and invasiveness of these cells (using scratch test and Transwell assay), their growth capacities F(cell cycle analysis, viability, clonogenic activity) and apoptosis assays), adhesion-independent colony-formation capacities, as well as the effect of PDPN silencing on MMPs expression and activity (zymography).
RESULTS: We found that PDPN-induced cell phenotype depended on the genetic background of thyroid tumor cells. PDPN down-regulation in BcPAP cells was negatively correlated with the migration and invasion, in contrast to TPC1 cells in which PDPN depletion resulted in enhanced migration and invasiveness. Moreover, our results suggest that in BcPAP cells, PDPN may be involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through regulating the expression of the ezrin, radixin and moesin (E/R/M) proteins, MMPs 9 and MMP2, remodeling of actin cytoskeleton and cellular protrusions. We also demonstrated that PDPN expression is associated with the MAPK signaling pathway. The inhibition of the MAPK pathway resulted in a decreased PDPN expression, increased E/R/M phosphorylation and reduced cell migration. Additionally, PDPN depleted BcPAP cells treated with inhibitors of MEK1/2 kinases (U0126) or of the BRAF V600E protein (PLX4720) had reduced motility, similar to that previously observed in TPC1 cells after PDPN knock-down.
CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our data suggest that PDPN may play an important role in the control of invasion and migration of papillary thyroid carcinoma cells in association with the E/R/M, MMPs and MAPK kinases.",BMC Cancer,2019,"['Sikorska J', 'Gaweł D', 'Domek H', 'Rudzińska M', 'Czarnocka B']",
30654452,Epigenetic Modifications of the Liver Tumor Cell Line HepG2 Increase Their Drug Metabolic Capacity.,"Although human liver tumor cells have reduced metabolic functions as compared to primary human hepatocytes (PHH) they are widely used for pre-screening tests of drug metabolism and toxicity. The aim of the present study was to modify liver cancer cell lines in order to improve their drug-metabolizing activities towards PHH. It is well-known that epigenetics is strongly modified in tumor cells and that epigenetic regulators influence the expression and function of Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes through altering crucial transcription factors responsible for drug-metabolizing enzymes. Therefore, we screened the epigenetic status of four different liver cancer cell lines (Huh7, HLE, HepG2 and AKN-1) which were reported to have metabolizing drug activities. Our results showed that HepG2 cells demonstrated the highest similarity compared to PHH. Thus, we modified the epigenetic status of HepG2 cells towards 'normal' liver cells by 5-Azacytidine (5-AZA) and Vitamin C exposure. Then, mRNA expression of Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker SNAIL and CYP enzymes were measured by PCR and determinate specific drug metabolites, associated with CYP enzymes by LC/MS. Our results demonstrated an epigenetic shift in HepG2 cells towards PHH after exposure to 5-AZA and Vitamin C which resulted in a higher expression and activity of specific drug metabolizing CYP enzymes. Finally, we observed that 5-AZA and Vitamin C led to an increased expression of Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) and E-Cadherin and a significant down regulation of Snail1 (SNAIL), the key transcriptional repressor of E-Cadherin. Our study shows, that certain phase I genes and their enzyme activities are increased by epigenetic modification in HepG2 cells with a concomitant reduction of EMT marker gene SNAIL. The enhancing of liver specific functions in hepatoma cells using epigenetic modifiers opens new opportunities for the usage of cell lines as a potential liver in vitro model for drug testing and development.",Int J Mol Sci,2019,"['Ruoß M', 'Damm G', 'Vosough M', 'Ehret L', 'Grom-Baumgarten C', 'Petkov M', 'Naddalin S', 'Ladurner R', 'Seehofer D', 'Nussler A', 'Sajadian S']",

Here, we report that Bach1 expression was significantly higher in human epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) tissues than in normal ovarian tissues and that higher levels of Bach1 were associated with tumor stage and poorer overall and progression-free survival. We found that Bach1 enhanced the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes, including Slug and Snail, and promoted cell migration by recruiting HMGA2 in the human EOC cell line A2780. Bach1 overexpression enhanced and Bach1 knockout reduced the expression of Slug and the metastasis of EOC cells in a tumor metastasis mouse model. Bach1 expression was positively correlated with Slug and HMGA2 expression in human ovarian cancer tissues. In addition, Bach1 activated p-AKT and p-p70S6K, increased the expression of cyclin D1, and promoted the growth of ovarian cancer cells in vitro and tumor xenografts in vivo. Together, our findings reveal that Bach1 enhances tumor growth and recruits HMGA2 to promote EMT and ovarian cancer metastasis.",Cancer Lett.,2019,"['Han W', 'Zhang Y', 'Niu C', 'Guo J', 'Li J', 'Wei X', 'Jia M', 'Zhi X', 'Yao L', 'Meng D']",

During metastasis, tumor cells enter the circulation to gain access to distant tissues, but how this fluid microenvironment influences cancer cell biology is poorly understood.

CONCLUSION: Fluid shear stress experienced during systemic circulation of human breast tumor cells can lead to specific acquisition of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-like potential that promotes EMT, mesenchymal-epithelial transition, and metastasis to distant organs. Our data revealed that biomechanical forces appeared to be important microenvironmental factors that not only drive hematopoietic development but also lead to acquisition of CSLCs/TIC potential in cancer metastasis.

30649699,Therapeutic implications of cancer epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).,"The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) comprises an essential biological process involving cancer progression as well as initiation. While the EMT has been regarded as a phenotypic conversion from epithelial to mesenchymal cells, recent evidence indicates that it plays a critical role in stemness, metabolic reprogramming, immune evasion and therapeutic resistance of cancer cells. Interestingly, several transcriptional repressors including Snail (SNAI1), Slug (SNAI2) and the ZEB family constitute key players for EMT in cancer as well as in the developmental process. Note that the dynamic conversion between EMT and epithelial reversion (mesenchymal-epithelial transition, MET) occurs through variable intermediate-hybrid states rather than being a binary process. Given the close connection between oncogenic signaling and EMT repressors, the EMT has emerged as a therapeutic target or goal (in terms of MET reversion) in cancer therapy.

30648319,TGFβ1-induced cell motility but not cell proliferation is mediated through Cten in colorectal cancer.,"Cten (C-terminal tensin-like) is a member of the tensin protein family found in complex with integrins at focal adhesions. It promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell motility. The precise mechanisms regulating Cten are unknown, although we and others have shown that Cten could be under the regulation of several cytokines and growth factors. Since transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) regulates integrin function and promotes EMT/cell motility, we were prompted to investigate whether TGF-β1 induces EMT and cell motility through Cten signalling in colorectal cancer. TGF-β1 signalling was modulated by either stimulation with TGF-β1 or knockdown of TGF-β1 in the CRC cell lines SW620 and HCT116. The effect of this modulation on expression of Cten, EMT markers and on cellular function was tested. The role of Cten as a direct mediator of TGF-β1 signalling was investigated in a CRC cell line in which the Cten gene had been deleted (SW620",Int J Exp Pathol,2018,"['Asiri A', 'Raposo TP', 'Alfahed A', 'Ilyas M']",
30646925,Downregulation of miRNA-214 in cancer-associated fibroblasts contributes to migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells through targeting FGF9 and inducing EMT.,"BACKGROUND: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), one of the principal constituents of the tumor microenvironment, have a pivotal role in tumor progression. Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) in CAFs contributes to the tumor-promoting ability of CAFs. However, the mechanism underlying the involvement of miRNAs in CAFs of gastric cancer (GC) is not fully understood. This study aimed to explore the effects of miRNA-214 in CAFs on GC migration and invasion.
METHODS: The primary CAFs and corresponding normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated. Cell counting kit-8, EdU cell proliferation staining and Transwell assays were used to determine the role of miRNA-214 in GC progression. Real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, and dual-luciferase reporter assay were performed to verify the target genes of miRNA-214. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis were applied to detect the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization were implemented to analyze the fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) and miRNA-214 expression in human GC tissues, respectively. Finally, to assess its prognostic relevance, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was conducted.
RESULTS: MiRNA-214 was significantly downregulated in CAFs of GC compared with NFs. The upregulation of miRNA-214 in CAFs inhibited GC cell migration and invasion in vitro but failed to affect proliferation. Moreover, GC cells cultured with conditioned medium from CAFs transfected with miR-214 mimic showed increased expression of E-cadherin and decreased expression of Vimentin, N-cadherin and Snail, indicating the suppression of EMT of GC cells. Furthermore, FGF9 was proved to be a direct target gene of miR-214. The expression of FGF9 was higher in CAFs than that in tumor cells not only in primary tumor but also in lymph node metastatic sites (30.0% vs 11.9%, P < 0.01 and 32.1% vs 12.3%, P < 0.01, respectively). Abnormal expression of FGF9 in CAFs of lymph node metastatic sites was significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients with GC (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that miR-214 inhibited the tumor-promoting effect of CAFs on GC through targeting FGF9 in CAFs and regulating the EMT process in GC cells, suggesting miRNA-214/FGF9 in CAFs as a potential target for therapeutic approaches in GC.",J.

Delineation of the molecular pathways underlying such trans-differentiation has motivated a combination therapy with MEK inhibitors and the anti-diabetic drug Rosiglitazone in various mouse models of murine and human breast cancer in vivo.

METHODS: We identified CTCs for expression of the epithelial cell marker cytokeratin or epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) (E-CTC), the mesenchymal cell markers vimentin and twist (M-CTC), or both (E/M-CTC) using the CanPatrol system. Between July 2014 and July 2016, 107 patients with PDAC were enrolled for CTC evaluation. CTC enumeration and classification were correlated with patient clinicopathological features and outcomes.
RESULTS: CTCs were detected in 78.5% of PDAC patients. The number of total CTCs ranged from 0 to 26 across all 107 patients, with a median value of six. CTC status correlated with lymph node metastasis, TNM stage, distant metastasis, blood lymphocyte counts, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with ≥ 6 total CTCs had significantly decreased overall survival and progression-free survival compared with patients with < 6 total CTCs.

30643193,Increased type III TGF-β receptor shedding decreases tumorigenesis through induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.,"The type III TGF-β receptor (TβRIII) is a TGF-β co-receptor that presents ligand to the type II TGF-β receptor to initiate signaling. TβRIII also undergoes ectodomain shedding to release a soluble form (sTβRIII) that can bind ligand, sequestering it away from cell surface receptors. We have previously identified a TβRIII extracellular mutant that has enhanced ectodomain shedding (""super shedding (SS)""-TβRIII-SS). Here, we utilize TβRIII-SS to study the balance of cell surface and soluble TβRIII in the context of lung cancer. We demonstrate that expressing TβRIII-SS in lung cancer cell models induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and that these TβRIII-SS (EMT) cells are less migratory, invasive and adhesive and more resistant to gemcitabine. Moreover, TβRIII-SS (EMT) cells exhibit decreased tumorigenicity but increased growth rate in vitro and in vivo.

By activating α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7-nAChRs) in these tumors nicotine and its tobacco-derived nitrosamine, NNK, contribute to these oncogenic processes. Here, we investigated whether the human-specific duplicated form of the α7-nAChR subunit (dupα7) behaves as an endogenous negative regulator of α7-nAChR-mediated tumorigenic activity induced by tobacco in NSCLC cells, similarly to its influence on other α7-nAChR-controlled functions in non-tumor cells.

METHODS: Modified murine and human osteosarcoma cell lines were evaluated for cell adhesion, aggregation (spheroid), motility (wound healing assay), phenotypic markers expression (RT-qPCR, western blot). Cell-derived xenograft FFPE samples and patients samples (TMA) were assessed by IHC.
RESULTS: CYR61 levels controlled the expression of markers related to an Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like process, allowing tumor cells to migrate acquiring a competent morphology, and to be able to invade the surrounding stroma. This phenotypic shift indeed correlated with tumor grade and aggressiveness in patient samples and with the metastatic dissemination potential in cell-derived xenograft models. Unlike EGFR or PDGFR, IGF1Rβ levels correlated with CYR61 and N-cadherin levels, and with the aggressiveness of osteosarcoma and overall survival. The expression levels of IGF1Rβ/IGF1 axis were controlled by CYR61, and anti-IGF1 neutralizing antibody prevented the CYR61-induced phenotypic shift, aggregation, and motility abilities.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study provides new evidence that CYR61 acts as a key inducing factor in the metastatic progression of osteosarcoma by playing a critical role in primary tumor dissemination, with a process associated with IGF1/IGFR stimulation. This suggests that CYR61 may represent a potential pivotal target for therapeutic management of metastases spreading in osteosarcoma, in correlation with IGF1/IGFR pathway.",BMC Cancer,2019,"['Habel N', 'Stefanovska B', 'Carène D', 'Patiño-Garcia A', 'Lecanda F', 'Fromigué O']",
30641937,PPP3CB Inhibits Migration of G401 Cells via Regulating Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition and Promotes G401 Cells Growth.,"PPP3CB belongs to the phosphoprotein phosphatases (PPPs) group. Although the majority of the PPP family play important roles in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of tumor cells, little is known about the function of PPP3CB in the EMT process. Here, we found PPP3CB had high expression in kidney mesenchymal-like cells compared with kidney epithelial-like cells. Knock-down of PPP3CB downregulated epithelial marker E-cadherin and upregulated mesenchymal marker Vimentin, promoting the transition of cell states from epithelial to mesenchymal and reorganizing the actin cytoskeleton which contributed to cell migration. Conversely, overexpression of PPP3CB reversed EMT and inhibited migration of tumor cells. Besides, in vitro and in vivo experiments indicated that the loss of PPP3CB suppressed the tumor growth. However, the deletion of the phosphatase domain of PPP3CB showed no effect on the expression of E-cadherin, migration, and G401 cell proliferation. Together, we demonstrate that PPP3CB inhibits G401 cell migration through regulating EMT and promotes cell proliferation, which are both associated with the phosphatase activity of PPP3CB.",Int J Mol Sci,2019,"['Chen L', 'He Q', 'Liu Y', 'Wu Y', 'Ni D', 'Liu J', 'Hu Y', 'Gu Y', 'Xie Y', 'Zhou Q', 'Li Q']",

30641414,Daurinoline suppressed the migration and invasion of chemo-resistant human non-small cell lung cancer cells by reversing EMT and Notch-1 and sensitized the cells to Taxol.,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most common malignancies, and Taxol is a cornerstone in the treatment. However, taxol-resistance eventually limits the clinical effects and applications. Daurinoline could restore the sensitivity of resistant MCF-7/adr and KBv200 cells. Whereas, the effect of daurinoline on the chemo-resistant NSCLC cells and the mechanism has not been elucidated. In this study, daurinoline was firstly demonstrated that inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT phenotype of chemo-resistant NSCLC cells. And these effects were associated with EMT and Notch-1 reversal. Moreover, daurinoline could significantly enhance the anti-tumor effect of Taxol rather than epirubicin, adriamycin and cisplatin. And the reverse fold (RF) value of daurinoline was greater than terfenadine reported before. There are little cytotoxic effects of daurinoline and its derivatives reported by L.W. Fu, et al. (2001). Therefore, daurinoline may be a potential anti-tumor agent or chemosensitizer for chemo-resistant NSCLC patients.",Environ. Toxicol.

30639194,Silencing of long noncoding RNA LINC00958 prevents tumor initiation of pancreatic cancer by acting as a sponge of microRNA-330-5p to down-regulate PAX8.,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) represents a relatively rare but severe malignancy worldwide. Accumulated studies have emphasized the potential of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) as therapeutic strategies for several human cancers. Thus, we aimed to investigate whether a novel non-coding RNA regulatory circuitry involved in PC. Aberrantly expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were screened out of microarray database. Following the determination of RNA expression, PANC-1 and BxPC-3 PC cells were adopted, after which the expression of miR-330-5p, PAX8 and LINC00958 were subsequently altered. RNA crosstalk was validated by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. In order to detect whether LINC00958 could act as ceRNA to competitively sponge miR-330-5p and regulate PAX8, subcellular location of LINC00958 and interaction between LINC00958 and miR-330-5p were measured by FISH and RNA pull down respectively. The epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, cell invasion, and tumor growth were determined in vitro and in vivo. LINC00958 and PAX8 were up-regulated, while miR-330-5p was down-regulated during PC. LINC00958 mainly expressed in the cytoplasm and LINC00958 competitively sponged miR-330-5p. Upregulated miR-330-5p or downregulated PAX8 inhibited the EMT process as well as the invasion and metastasis ability of the PC cells. Moreover, the results indicated that miR-330-5p negatively targeted PAX8, and LINC00958 ultimately showcasing its ability to bind to miR-330-5p through its interaction with AGO2. Therefore, silencing of LINC00958 may bind to miR-330-5p to inhibit PAX8 in a competitive fashion, thereby preventing the progression of PC.",Cancer Lett.,2019,"['Chen S', 'Chen JZ', 'Zhang JQ', 'Chen HX', 'Qiu FN', 'Yan ML', 'Tian YF', 'Peng CH', 'Shen BY', 'Chen YL', 'Wang YD']",

In the present study, we observed that the expression levels of PFN1 were significantly decreased in HCC tissues and cell lines. Low PFN1 expression was significantly correlated with aggressive clinicopathological characteristics and poor prognosis of HCC patients. Further in vitro experiments demonstrated that overexpression of PFN1 remarkably inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT of HCC cells. Moreover, we also found that PFN1 was a direct target gene of miR-19a-3p, and in HCC tissues, and there was a significantly inverse correlation between PFN1 mRNA and miR-19a-3p expression.

30635820,LncRNA ZEB2-AS1 contributes to the tumorigenesis of gastric cancer via activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.,"Studies have shown that long noncoding RNA Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 antisense RNA 1 (ZEB2-AS1) is involved in the progression of lung cancer, bladder cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, its role in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer remains unknown. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway contributes to the development of gastric cancer. ZEB2-AS1 expression was firstly detected in the gastric carcinoma tissue samples as well as in gastric cancer cells. Knockdown of ZEB2-AS1 was performed by ZEB2-AS1-shRNA, and the viability, migration, invasion, and apoptosis of gastric cancer cells were determined by CCK-8, scratch assay, transwell, and flow cytometry, respectively. Furthermore, levels of Ki-67, PCNA, VEGF, MMP9, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (E-cadherin, Vimentin and ZEB2), cleaved caspase 3/8/9 and PARP, active β-catenin, c-Myc, cyclinD1, and AXIN2 were assayed by Western blot or real-time PCR. Additionally, the role and mechanism of ZEB2-AS1 were confirmed in a xenograft nude mouse model. We found ZEB2-AS1 expression was increased in gastric carcinoma samples, and it was correlated with tumor progression. Also, its expression was elevated in gastric cancer cells. Knockdown of ZEB2-AS1 reduced the proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT, but increased the apoptosis of gastric carcinoma cells. Furthermore, ZEB2-AS1 downregulation remarkably suppressed the expression of Ki-67, PCNA, VEGF and MMP9, and the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, whereas elevated the levels of cleaved caspase 3/8/9 and PARP in gastric cancer cells. And ZEB2 overexpression reversed the effects of ZEB2-AS1 downregulation on the proliferation, EMT and inactivation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Additionally, ZEB2-AS1 knockdown inhibited tumor growth, Ki-67 staining, and the expression of VEGF, MMP9, active β-catenin, c-Myc, cyclinD1, and AXIN2 in mice. In conclusion, ZEB2-AS1 promotes the tumorigenesis of gastric carcinoma that is related to the upregulation of ZEB2 and the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.",Mol. Cell.

30635656,"B591, a novel specific pan-PI3K inhibitor, preferentially targets cancer stem cells.","Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been implicated in metastasis, relapse, and therapeutic resistance of cancer, so successful cancer therapy may therefore require the development of drugs against CSCs or combining anti-CSCs drugs with conventional therapies. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway is one of the most frequently activated signaling pathways in human cancer, playing a central role in tumorigenesis as well as the maintenance of CSCs. Here, we designed and identified B591, a dihydrobenzofuran-imidazolium salt, as a novel specific pan-PI3K inhibitor with potent inhibitory activity against class I PI3K isoforms, which showed effective inhibition of cellular PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway and robust antitumor activity in a set of cancer cell lines. Notably, compared with bulk tumor cell populations, B591 exhibited more potency in suppressing CSCs survival and inducing CSCs apoptosis, and presence of B591 effectively eliminated paclitaxel-enriched CSCs. B591 diminished self-renewal capacity and decreased the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers of CSCs. In vivo, B591 preferentially decreased CSCs levels in mouse xenograft model of human breast cancer as evidenced especially by remarkable reduction of tumor-initiating ability. Consistent with the preferential targeting of CSCs, B591 effectively inhibited breast tumor metastasis and delayed tumor regrowth following paclitaxel treatment. Taken together, our findings establish B591, a novel PI3K inhibitor, as a strong candidate for clinical evaluation as a CSCs targeting agent.",Oncogene,2019,"['Zhou H', 'Yu C', 'Kong L', 'Xu X', 'Yan J', 'Li Y', 'An T', 'Gong L', 'Gong Y', 'Zhu H', 'Zhang H', 'Yang X', 'Li Y']",

However, the effects on EMT in gastric cancer and its precise molecular mechanism in gastric cancer remain unclear.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: RT-qPCR was performed to evaluate the expression level of miR-129-5p and HMGB1 in cell lines. Cell proliferation was detected via CCK-8. The epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) related proteins and the expression of HMGB1 were detected by western blot analysis. Luciferase assays were used to validate binding seeds between miR-129-5p and HMGB1.
RESULTS: miR-129-5p was downregulated in gastric cancer cells compared with GES-1. At the same time EMT was promoted in gastric cancer cells compared to GES-1. Overexpression of miR-129-5p inhibited EMT and proliferation. MiR-129-5p negatively and directly targeted HMGB1. HMGB1 was upregulated in gastric cancer cells and HMGB1 knocked-down inhibited EMT and cell proliferation.

30631151,Sumoylation of Flotillin-1 promotes EMT in metastatic prostate cancer by suppressing Snail degradation.,"Flotillin-1 (Flot-1) has been shown to regulate cancer progression, but the regulatory role of post-translational modifications of Flot-1 on cancers remains elusive. Herein, we show that up-regulated E2 conjugating enzyme UBC9 sumoylates Flot-1 at Lys-51 and Lys-195 with small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-2/3 modification in metastatic prostate cancer. Mitogen induced the sumoylation and nuclear translocation of Flot-1. The nuclear-targeted Flot-1 physically interacted with Snail, and inhibited Snail degradation through the proteasome in a sumoylation-dependent manner, thereby promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Sumoylation of Flot-1 by up-regulated UBC9 in human metastatic prostate cancer tissues and prostate cancer cells with high metastatic potential positively correlated with the stabilization of Snail and the induction of Snail-mediated EMT genes in the metastatic prostate cancer. Our study reveals a new mechanism of sumoylated Flot-1-mediating Snail stabilization, and identifies a novel sumoylated Flot-1-Snail signaling axis in EMT of metastatic prostate cancer.",Oncogene,2019,"['Jang D', 'Kwon H', 'Choi M', 'Lee J', 'Pak Y']",

Retention in endoplasmic reticulum 1 (RER1) is an important retention factor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, it remains elusive whether RER1 is involved in the retention of disease-related proteins.
METHODS: We analyzed the expression level of RER1 in PC and adjacent tissues, and also employed Kaplan-Meier's analysis to identify the correlation between RER1 expression and overall survival rate. Cell proliferation, colony formation, tumor formation, scratch test, and transwell invasion assays were performed in RER1 knockdown cells and negative control cells.
RESULTS: We hereby reported the important functions of RER1 in tumorigenesis and metastasis of PC, evidenced by inhibitory effects of RER1 knockdown on PC cell proliferation, migration and aggressiveness. Tumor formation was also significantly repressed in RER1 knockdown cells compared to control. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α was found to be an upstream regulator of RER1. Knockdown HIF-1α cells exhibited similar repressive impact on cell proliferation as RER1, and showed diminished migratory and invasive abilities under hypoxic condition.
CONCLUSION: The present study has demonstrated that RER1 enhances the progression of PC through promoting cell proliferation, migration and aggressiveness.",J. Exp. Clin.

However, it is unknown whether KCa3.1 plays a role in the genesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide with a very poor prognosis. In our study, we found that the expression of KCa3.1 was significantly elevated in poorly differentiated HCC tissues compared to adjacent noncancerous tissues. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that KCa3.1 could promote cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC. Mechanistically, KCa3.1 promoted cell cycle progression and migration and invasion of HCC cells by activating S-phase protein kinase 2 (SKP2) to trigger the degradation of p21 and p27 and targeting Reelin (RELN) to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), respectively.

Cisplatin (DDP) is the first line treatment for ovarian cancer. However, initiation of EMT confers insensitivity to chemotherapy. The present study aimed to verify and examine the mechanisms underlying the effects of BMP9 on treatment with DDP for ovarian cancer. Prior to treatment with DDP, ovarian cancer cells were exposed to BMP9 for 3 days. Following this, cell viability, apoptosis rate and the extent of DNA damage were evaluated to compare the effects of DDP on BMP9‑pretreated and non‑pretreated ovarian cancer cells. In addition, EMT marker expression was evaluated by western blotting and immunofluorescence. The results demonstrated that BMP9 pretreatment inhibited the cytotoxicity of DDP on ovarian cancer cells. Additionally, BMP9‑pretreated ovarian cancer cells had downregulated expression of the epithelial marker E‑cadherin, which was accompanied by an upregulation of the mesenchymal markers N‑cadherin, Snail, Slug, and Twist. Taken together, the findings of the present study indicated that BMP9 conferred resistance to DDP in ovarian cancer cells by inducing EMT. The present study provided valuable insight into the mechanisms of chemotherapy in ovarian cancer and highlighted the potential of BMP9 as a novel therapeutic target for improving cisplatin chemosensitivity.",Mol Med Rep,2019,"['Wang Y', 'Yang B', 'Zhao J', 'Yu X', 'Liu X', 'Zhang L', 'Zhang Y', 'Li X', 'Zhai Z']",

Dysregulation of miRNAs has been reported in numerous cancer types, including lung cancer. In the present study, the role of miR‑505 in non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells was investigated. miR‑505 served a tumor suppressor role in NSCLC cells. By reverse transcriptase‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction detection, it was demonstrated that miR‑505 was downregulated in NSCLC tissues and cell lines, which is negatively associated with large tumor size, Tumor‑Node‑Metastasis stage and distant metastasis in patients with NSCLC. Functional studies revealed that miR‑505 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial‑mesenchymal transition progress in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Mechanically, mitogen‑activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3 (MAP3K3) was identified as a direct target of miR‑505 by binding to its 3'untranslated region and demonstrated to mediate the tumor suppressor roles of miR‑505 in NSCLC cells. The effect of miR‑505 on the activation of AKT/nuclear factor‑κB (NFκB) pathway, which was downstream targets of MAP3K3, was further analyzed by western blot analysis and immunofluorescence analyses. The data demonstrated the inhibition of the AKT/NFκB pathway upon overexpressing miR‑505 and the activation of AKT/NFκB pathway upon silencing miR‑505. Collectively, the data revealed the novel role and target of miR‑505 in NSCLC cells, which may provide novel insights regarding its role in the carcinogenesis of NSCLC and its potential values for clinical applications.",Int.

30628651,MicroRNA-200b and -301 are associated with gemcitabine response as biomarkers in pancreatic carcinoma cells.,"Chemotherapy resistance (congenital or acquired) is one of the principal challenges for the treatment of pancreatic carcinoma. Recent evidence has demonstrated that epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is associated with chemoresistance in pancreatic carcinoma cells. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the development of chemoresistance remains unknown, and limited therapeutic options are available. Therefore, to anticipate individual chemosensitivity or acquired chemoresistance for patients with pancreatic carcinoma, predictive biomarkers are urgently required. Extensive evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) serve a crucial role in regulating EMT. The aim of this study was to examine the potential role of miRNA (miR)‑200b and miR‑301 in predicting the chemo‑responses to treatment for pancreatic carcinoma. The present results demonstrate that miR‑200b expression predicted chemo‑sensitivity and may have potential as a biomarker. In six different pancreatic carcinoma cell lines (Capan‑1, Capan‑2, Panc‑1, MIAPaCa‑2, BxPC‑3 and PL45 cells), the expression of miR‑200b correlated positively with chemosensitivity. Moreover, the enhanced expression of miR‑200b increased chemosensitivity and induced mesenchymal to epithelial transition. Conversely, miR‑301 modulated gemcitabine resistance and induced EMT through the downregulation of cadherin 1 expression. In addition, gemcitabine‑resistant cells (Capan‑2 and Panc‑1) exhibited upregulated miR‑301 expression and downregulated gemcitabine‑induced apoptosis. In summary, these two miRNAs may serve roles as biomarkers in pancreatic carcinoma, miR‑200b expression may predict chemosensitivity, and elevated miR‑301 expression may have potential applications in the prediction of acquired gemcitabine resistance.",Int.

30628646,Long non‑coding RNA FOXD2‑AS1/miR‑150‑5p/PFN2 axis regulates breast cancer malignancy and tumorigenesis.,"Breast cancer (BC) is a common cancer and leading cause of cancer‑associated mortality in women. Abnormal expression of long non‑coding RNA FOXD2 adjacent opposite strand RNA 1 (FOXD2‑AS1) was associated with the development of a number of tumors. However, whether FOXD2‑AS1 is dysregulated in BC and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, it was identified that FOXD2‑AS1 expression was upregulated in BC tissue, cell lines and sphere subpopulation. Additionally, the abnormal upregulation of FOXD2‑AS1 predicted poor prognosis in patients with BC. Furthermore, downregulation of FOXD2‑AS1 decreased cell proliferation, and migratory and invasive abilities in BC cells, and decreased the growth of transplanted tumors in vivo. Downregulation of FOXD2‑AS1 decreased the percentage of CD44 antigen+/signal transducer CD24- in breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) cells, and decreased the expression of numerous stem factors, including Nanog, octamer‑binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4), and sex determining region Y‑box 2 (SOX2), and inhibited the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition process. FOXD2‑AS1 was identified to be primarily located in the cytoplasm. Using bioinformatics analysis, a reporter gene assay and reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction assays, it was demonstrated that microRNA (miR)‑150‑5p was able to bind directly with the 3'‑untranslated region of FOXD2‑AS1 and PFN2 mRNA. miR‑150‑5p mimics decreased the cell proliferation, migration and invasion of BC cells. FOXD2‑AS1 knockdown significantly inhibited the miR‑150‑5p inhibitor‑induced increase in Nanog, Oct4 and SOX2 expression. The miR‑150‑5p inhibitor‑induced increase in N‑cadherin, and decrease in E‑cadherin and vimentin was inhibited by FOXD2‑AS1 knockdown. Profilin 2 (PFN2) expression was significantly upregulated in BC tissues. Additionally, the abnormal upregulation of PFN2 was associated with poor prognosis in patients with BC. FOXD2‑AS1 and PFN2 expression was positively correlated. Collectively, the present results demonstrated the role of the FOXD2‑AS1/miR‑150‑5p/PFN2 axis in the development of BC, and provides novel targets for the treatment of BC, and potential biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of BC.",Int.

30626935,The miR-29c-KIAA1199 axis regulates gastric cancer migration by binding with WBP11 and PTP4A3.,"Gastric cancer (GC) is the second leading cause of death among patients with cancer in China. The primary reason of GC treatment failure is metastasis. Therefore, identifying metastatic biomarkers and clarifying the regulatory mechanisms involved in the GC metastatic process are important. Here, we found that KIAA1199, a cell migration-inducing protein, was significantly overexpressed in GC and correlated with lymph node metastasis and poorer patient survival. Additionally, the introduction of KIAA1199 dramatically promoted GC cell proliferation and migration in vitro and in vivo, and the inhibition of KIAA1199 suppressed GC cell growth and migration and induced GC cell apoptosis. Cell migration is a functional consequence of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In this study, we found that KIAA1199 inhibition or overexpression regulated the expression of E-cadherin and N-cadherin through KIAA1199 binding to WW domain binding protein 11 (WBP11) and protein tyrosine phosphatase type IVA, member 3 (PTP4A3) and through the subsequent activation of the FGFR4/Wnt/β-catenin and EGFR signaling pathways. More importantly, ectopic expression of WBP11 or PTP4A3 blocked the stimulatory effects of KIAA1199 on GC cell proliferation and migration. Meanwhile, we illustrated that KIAA1199 was a target gene of miR-29c-3p and that miR-29c-3p overexpression led to decreased migration of GC cells in vitro and in vivo by suppressing the expression of KIAA1199 and several key proteins in the Wnt/β-catenin and EGFR signaling pathways (e.g., WBP11, FGFR4, and PTP4A3). Taken together, these data demonstrate that KIAA1199 promotes GC metastasis by activating EMT-related signaling pathways and that miR-29c-3p regulates GC cell migration in vitro and in vivo by regulating KIAA1199 expression and activating the FGFR4/Wnt/β-catenin and EGFR signaling pathways.

30625181,Metformin exhibited anticancer activity by lowering cellular cholesterol content in breast cancer cells.,"Metformin, a widely prescribed anti-diabetic drug, shows anticancer activity in various cancer types. Few studies documented that there was a decreased level of LDL and total cholesterol in blood serum of metformin users. Based on these views, this study aimed to determine if metformin exhibits anticancer activity by alleviating cholesterol level in cancer cells. The present study found that treatment of breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells with metformin significantly decreased cholesterol content with concomitant inhibition of various cholesterol regulatory genes (e.g., HMGCoR, LDLR and SREBP1). Metformin decreased cell viability, migration and stemness in metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells. Similarly, metformin treatment suppressed expressions of anti-apoptotic genes BCL2 and Bcl-xL, and mesenchymal genes vimentin, N-cadherin, Zeb1 and Zeb2 with simultaneous enhancement of apoptotic caspase 3 and Bax, and epithelial genes E-cadherin and keratin 19 expressions, confirming an inhibitory effect of metformin in tumorigenesis. Similar to metformin, depletion of cholesterol by methyl beta cyclodextrin (MBCD) diminished cell viability, migration, EMT and stemness in breast cancer cells. Moreover, metformin-inhibited cell viability, migration, colony and sphere formations were reversed back by cholesterol treatment. Similarly, cholesterol treatment inverted metformin-reduced several gene expressions (e.g., Bcl-xL, BCL2, Zeb1, vimentin, and BMI-1). Additionally, zymography data demonstrated that cholesterol upregulated metformin-suppressed MMP activity. These findings suggested that metformin revealed anticancer activity by lowering of cholesterol content in breast cancer cells. Thus, this study, for the first time, unravelled this additional mechanism of metformin-mediated anticancer activity.",PLoS ONE,2019,"['Sharma A', 'Bandyopadhayaya S', 'Chowdhury K', 'Sharma T', 'Maheshwari R', 'Das A', 'Chakrabarti G', 'Kumar V', 'Mandal CC']",

However, the relevance of MARCKS in gastric cancer (GC) needs to be elucidated. MATERIAL AND METHODS The abundance of MARCKS in GC tissues was assessed using techniques of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Moreover, the MARCKS expression profile in the TCGA database was analyzed through an online website analysis. We also investigated MARCKS function using cell wounding and Matrigel invasion assays. RESULTS TCGA analysis and our data suggest that transcript abundance and protein level of MARCKS was higher in GC tumor samples compared with peri-tumor tissues. There was a remarkable association of upregulated MARCKS with the cell differentiation (P<0.001), T stage (P=0.034), and N stage (P=0.002) followed by advanced TNM phase (P=0.008). Furthermore, it was predicted that higher expression of MARCKS is linked to poor overall survival (P=0.015) and disease-free survival (P=0.020), and that high levels of MARCKS function as an independent prognostic marker, as shown by multivariate Cox regression analysis in prediction of poor overall (HR=0.408; 95% confidence interval=0.247-0.674; P<0.001) and disease-free survival rates (HR=0.525; 95% confidence interval=0.216-0.584; P<0.001). GC cells showed significant reduction in cell migration and invasion upon depletion of MARCKS as noted through Matrigel invasion and cell wounding assays. Further analyses showed that silencing MARCKS impeded the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). CONCLUSIONS Our study indicates that elevated expression of MARCKS is significantly associated with metastatic capability of GC cells, and MARCKS overexpression can serve as a biomarker of GC poor prognosis.",Med.

30621694,Activation of LncRNA TINCR by H3K27 acetylation promotes Trastuzumab resistance and epithelial-mesenchymal transition by targeting MicroRNA-125b in breast Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab resistance followed by metastasis is a major obstacle for improving the clinical outcome of patients with advanced human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER-2+) breast cancer. While long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can modulate cell behavior, the contribution of these RNAs in trastuzumab resistance and metastasis of HER-2+ breast cancer is not well known. In this study, we sought to identify the regulatory role of lncRNA in trastuzumab resistance and accompanied Epithelial-mesenchymal Transition (EMT) process in advanced HER-2+ breast cancer.
METHODS: Trastuzumab-resistant SKBR-3-TR and BT474-TR cell lines were established by grafting SKBR-3 and BT474 cells into mouse models and subjected to trastuzumab treatment. LncRNA microarray followed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out to verify the differentially expressed lncRNAs. Western blotting, bioinformatics analysis, immunofluorescence assay and immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP and RIP) were performed to identify the involvement and functional interactions between H3K27 acetylation and terminal differentiation-induced non-coding RNA (TINCR) or between TINCR and its downstream genes including miR-125b, HER-2 and Snail-1. In addition, a series of in vitro and in vivo assays were performed to assess the functions of TINCR.
RESULTS: An increase in both, IC
CONCLUSION: TINCR could promote trastuzumab resistance and the accompanied EMT process in breast cancer. Therefore, TINCR might be a potential indicator for prognosis and a therapeutic target to enhance the clinical efficacy of trastuzumab treatment.",Mol.

30618144,"Biological and molecular effects of bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitors JQ1, IBET-151, and IBET-762 in OSCC cells.","BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) management, survival rates remain relatively low and novel anti-neoplastic agents are needed. Bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitors proved to be promising agents for cancer treatment. We investigated the effects of three BET inhibitors (JQ1, IBET-151, IBET-762) on SCC-25 cell line and primary oral cancer cell culture.
METHODS: Cell viability was evaluated by MTT. Protein levels of MCM5 and cleaved-PARP were estimated by Western blot. Clonogenic and migratory abilities were determined by colony forming and scratch assays. BET inhibitors effects on mRNA levels of E-Cadherin, Vimentin, SNAI1, SNAI2, CLU, SERPINI1, MCM5, c-Myc, E2F, IL7R, and PPARg were analyzed by qPCR.
RESULTS: BET inhibitors significantly reduced oral cancer cell viability. JQ1 showed the greatest effect reducing cell viability to 10%, both in SCC-25 and primary OSCC cultures (P < 0.001), compared to control cells. Cells treated with BET inhibitors displayed a reduction to 50% in colony forming capacity compared to control cells (P < 0.0001) and the colonies were smaller; they also had a 50%-60% reduction in migratory capacity (P < 0.05) compared to untreated cells. BET inhibitors had a significant impact on genes related to epithelial to mesenchymal transition and other cancer cell markers, notably on MCM5, a gene related to cell cycle control.
CONCLUSIONS: BET inhibitors induce both OSCC cell death and reduction of tumor aggressiveness. Molecular mechanisms of BET inhibition involve among others, MCM5 downregulation. Importantly, this study demonstrates for the first time the anti-tumoral effect of IBET-151 and IBET-762 in oral cancer.",J. Oral Pathol.

30616627,Tumor-associated neutrophils induce EMT by IL-17a to promote migration and invasion in gastric cancer cells.,"PURPOSE: Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) can contribute to gastric cancer (GC) progression and recurrence following therapy. Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) are associated with poor outcomes in a variety of cancers. However, it is not clear whether TANs interact with the EMT process during GC development.
METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was performed to examine the distribution and levels of CD66 + neutrophils in samples from 327 patients with GC. CD66b + TANs were isolated either directly from GC cell suspensions or were conditioned from healthy donor peripheral blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) stimulated with tumor tissue culture supernatants (TTCS) and placed into co-culture with MKN45 or MKN74 cells, after which migration, invasion and EMT were measured. Interleukin-17a (IL-17a) was blocked with a polyclonal antibody, and the STAT3 pathway was blocked with the specific inhibitor AG490.
RESULTS: Neutrophils were widely distributed in gastric tissues of patients with GC and were enriched predominantly at the invasion margin. Neutrophil levels at the invasion margin were an independent predictor of poor disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). IL-17a + neutrophils constituted a large portion of IL-17a-producing cells in GC, and IL-17a was produced at the highest levels in co-culture compared with that in TANs not undergoing co-culture. TANs enhanced the migration, invasion and EMT of GC cells through the secretion of IL-17a, which activated the Janus kinase 2/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK2/STAT3) pathway in GC cells, while deprivation of IL-17a using a neutralizing antibody or inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway with AG490 markedly reversed these TAN-induced phenotypes in GC cells induced by TANs.
CONCLUSIONS: Neutrophils correlate with tumor stage and predict poor prognosis in GC. TANs produce IL-17a, which promotes EMT of GC cells through JAK2/STAT3 signalling. Blockade of IL-17a signalling with a neutralizing antibody inhibits TAN-stimulated activity in GC cells. Therefore, IL-17a-targeted therapy might be used to treat patients with GC.",J. Exp. Clin.

30615851,ZEB1 mediates doxorubicin (Dox) resistance and mesenchymal characteristics of hepatocarcinoma cells.,"The acquired chemoresistance during long term chemotherapy is one of the most important factors to limit the application of Doxorubicin (Dox) on clinical treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Our present study found that Dox resistant HCC (HCC/Dox) cells had greater capability of in vitro migration and invasion compared to their parental cells. HCC/Dox cells exhibited mesenchymal characteristics, which was evidenced by the up regulation of fibronectin, vimentin while down regulation of E-Cadherin. Zeb1, one powerful epithelial mesenchymal transition related transcription factor (EMT-TF), was markedly upregulated in HCC/Dox cells. Targeted inhibition of Zeb1 via siRNA can suppress the cell migration and re-sensitized cells to Dox treatment. The upregulation of Zeb1 in HCC/Dox cells was due to the increasing protein and mRNA stability of Zeb1. In HCC/Dox cells, the down regulation of SIAH1 mediated the upregulation of protein stability of Zeb1, while decreased levels of miR-3129-5p was responsible for the increasing mRNA stability of Zeb1. Collectively, our data suggested that SIAH1 and miR-3129-5p induced upregulation of Zeb1 mediated the Dox resistance of HCC cells. Targeted inhibition of Zeb1 might be helpful to overcome of Dox resistance of HCC.",Exp. Mol. Pathol.,2019,"['Long L', 'Xiang H', 'Liu J', 'Zhang Z', 'Sun L']",
30614803,MicroRNA-124-3p suppresses cell migration and invasion by targeting ITGA3 signaling in bladder cancer.,"BACKGROUND: A growing body of studies have demonstrated the aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) contributes to human tumor metastasis. MicroRNA-124-3p (miR-124-3p), which is down-regulated in various cancers, has been found to be involved in several signaling pathways relevant to tumor cell migration and invasion. However, the roles of miR-124-3p in human bladder cancer remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the functional significance of miR-124-3p and to understand how it targets the integrin receptor, and thus affects the progression of human bladder cancer.
METHODS: Clinical specimens from 36 patients and three human bladder cancer cell lines were analyzed for miR-124-3p and integrin α3 (ITGA3) . To investigate the effects of miR-124-3p and ITGA3 on proliferation of bladder cancer cells, the MTT assay, colon-formation assay and flow cytometry were performed. In addition, wound healing assay and transwell assay were carried out to examine the migration and invasion of the bladder cancer cells transfected with miR-124-3p mimics or si-ITGA3. The luciferase reporter assay, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot were applied to validate the miR-124-3p directly binding with ITGA3. Finally, western blot was used to examine the expression level of the proteins involved in FAK/PI3K/AKT and FAK/Src signal pathway as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process.
RESULTS: The down-regulation of miR-124-3p and up-regulation of ITGA3 were observed in clinical specimens and bladder cancer cell lines. Overexpression of miR-124-3p or silencing ITGA3 inhibited tumor cell migration and invasion. Luciferase assay confirmed miR-124-3p directly targets ITGA3, and western blot suggested that miR-124-3p plays a crucial role in the EMT and metastasis of human bladder cancer through FAK/PI3K/AKT and FAK/Src signaling mechanism. Also, by targeting ITGA3, miR-124-3p can modulate the expression of N- and E-cadherin, and thus inhibit the EMT.
CONCLUSIONS: By targeting ITGA3 and downstream FAK/PI3K/AKT and FAK/Src signaling pathways, miR-124-3p suppresses cell migration and invasion in bladder cancer. Our study reasonably speculates that miR-124-3p can be potentially developed as a therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker for bladder cancer.",Cancer Biomark,2019,"['Wang JR', 'Liu B', 'Zhou L', 'Huang YX']",
30614794,MiR-27a promotes EMT in ovarian cancer through active Wnt/𝜷-catenin signalling by targeting FOXO1.,"BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer (OC) is the fifth most common type of cancer in women worldwide. MiR-27a plays an important role in the development of ovarian cancer. However, the exact function and molecular mechanism of miR-27a in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has not been thoroughly elucidated to date.
METHODS: Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to determine the expression of miR-27a and FOXO1 mRNA in ovarian tissues and cells. The function of miR-27a in ovarian cancer was investigated through overexpression and knockdown of miR-27a in vitro. Wound healing and Transwell assays were performed to evaluate the migration and invasive capacity of the cells. A luciferase reporter assay was conducted to confirm the interaction between miR-27a and FOXO1. Western blotting was used to evaluate FOXO1, EMT and Wnt/β-catenin relative protein expression.
RESULTS: In our study, we found that the mRNA expression level of miR-27a was significantly higher in ovarian cancer tissues and in HO8910 and OV90 cells. Functional experiments showed that miR-27a overexpression potentiated the migration and invasion of HO8910 and OV90 cells, while miR-27a inhibition reduced the cells' migration and invasion. Moreover, miR-27a upregulated the expression of mesenchymal cell markers and downregulated the expression of epithelial cell markers, which were restored via silencing of miR-27a expression. Subsequently, miR-27a was found to directly target and suppress the expression of FOXO1. Finally, we demonstrated that miR-27a promoted the progression of ovarian cancer cells and induced the process of EMT via the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway through inhibition of FOXO1.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results indicate that targeting miR-27a and FOXO1 could represent a strategy for anticancer therapy in ovarian cancer.",Cancer Biomark,2019,"['Zhang LY', 'Chen Y', 'Jia J', 'Zhu X', 'He Y', 'Wu LM']",

30611621,miR-124 regulates EMT based on ZEB2 target to inhibit invasion and metastasis in triple-negative breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is highly invasive and aggressive and lacks specific molecular targets to improve the prognosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) serve a role in promoting and suppressing tumors in various types of malignant cancer, including TNBC. However, the regulatory mechanism of miR-124 in TNBC has still remains unclear.
METHODS: Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to detect the expression of miR-124. Cell viability was analyzed with CCK-8 assay. Cell colony formation ability was detected with colony formation assay. Cell invasion was measured with transwell assay. Dual luciferase reporter assay was conducted to verify whether ZEB2 is a target gene of miR-124. The mRNA and protein expression levels of ZEB2 and EMT markers were detected by quantitative real time PCR and western blot, respectively.
RESULTS: Our results showed that miR-124 was down-regulated in TNBC tissues and cells. Overexpression of miR-124 inhibited the proliferation, metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of TNBC cells. Furthermore, ZEB2 3'UTR was considered to be a direct target of miR-124 with luciferase reporter assay. Rescue experiments confirmed that EMT was regulated by miR-124 via suppression of ZEB2.
CONCLUSION: miR-124 suppresses EMT and metastasis via ZEB2. Therefore, miR-124 may represent a potential therapeutic target for TNBC.",Pathol. Res. Pract.,2019,"['Ji H', 'Sang M', 'Liu F', 'Ai N', 'Geng C']",
30610808,MiR-199b-5p promotes malignant progression of osteosarcoma by regulating HER2.,"PURPOSE: MicroRNAs (miRs) are endogenous, noncoding small RNAs that play a key role in regulating biological and pathological processes. The oncogenic properties of miR-199b-5p have been demonstrated in previous studies but the effect of miR-199b-5p on osteosarcoma (OS) has not yet been clarified. This study aimed to investigate the effect of miR-199b-5p on OS and the relationship between this miR and the pathological parameters and prognosis of OS.
METHODS: MiR-199b-5p expression in 57 pairs of OS tissues, corresponding adjacent normal tissues and OS cells was measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).The relationship between miR-199b-5p and the pathological features and prognosis of OS patients was examined. We constructed small interfering (si) RNA to knock down miR-199b-5p expression in OS cell lines MG63 and U2OS. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), cell cloning assay and Transwell cell migration and invasion assay were applied for investigating the biological function of miR-199b-5p, respectively. Finally, western blot was used for exploring its underlying mechanism.
RESULTS: MiR-199b-5p expression in OS was significantly higher than that of normal tissues. Compared to patients w\sith low expression of miR-199b-5p, patients with high expression level tended to be with younger age, higher incidence of distant metastases and lower overall survival. Compared with interference sequence negative control (si-NC) group, the abilities of proliferation, invasion and metastasis of cells transfected with si-miR-199b-5p were significantly decreased. Western blot analysis indicated that expressions of key proteins related to epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) signaling pathway, including N-cadherin, Vimentin, β-catenin and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), were significantly decreased after transfection with si-miR-199b-5p. Furthermore, we found that miR-199b-5p promoted the progression of OS mainly through regulating HER2.
CONCLUSIONS: Upregulated miR-199b-5p is significantly related with stage, distant metastasis and poor prognosis of OS. This MiR may promote progression of OS through regulating HER2.",J BUON,2018,"['Chen Z', 'Zhao G', 'Zhang Y', 'Ma Y', 'Ding Y', 'Xu N']",
30610799,UNC119 promoted cell growth and migration by Wnt/β-catenin signal and TGF-β/EMT signal pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"PURPOSE: UNC119 was reported to be significantly up-regulated in hepatic cancer cells. However, the clinical significance of target UNC119 to reduce UNC119 expression and mechanisms in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are not well understood. Our purpose was to study how UNC119 is expressed in HCC and its connection with HCC progression.
METHODS: UNC119 expression was assessed with quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), western blot and immunohistochemical analyses in HCC cell lines and in tissues. The biological function of UNC119 for proliferation, growth and cell cycle of tumor cells were also analyzed both in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: UNC119 expression was up-regulated both in HCC cell lines as well as in tissues through comparison with normal liver cells and tissues. Higher concentration level of UNC119 not only promoted proliferation, but also enhanced migration and invasion of HCC cells. UNC119 promoted the progression of cell cycle and significantly promoted HCC cells growth through Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway and enhanced tumor migration and invasion via TGF-β/epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. Antibody for UNC119 (Anti-UNC119) efficiently inhibited HCC cells proliferation, migration and invasion by blocking Wnt/β-catenin and TGF-β/EMT signal pathway, respectively. Anti-UNC119 was not only beneficial for tumor remission, but also contributed to long-term survival of HCC-bearing mice.
CONCLUSION: UNC119 is significantly up-regulated and promoted cell growth and migration in hepatic cancer cells and tissues via Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway and TGF-β/EMT signal pathway, respectively. Anti-UNC119 treatment inhibited cell proliferation, growth, migration and invasion through inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin and GF-β/EMT signal pathway, respectively.",J BUON,2018,"['Liu ZH', 'Zhang YF', 'Xu ZD', 'Z H L', 'Y F Z', 'Z D X']",

METHODS: 30 pairs of human CRC and cancer-adjacent normal tissue samples were collected. The expression of miR-421 was detected in CRC tissues and cells. On-line target gene prediction software was applied to screen metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1), the potential downstream target gene of miR-421. The role of miR-421 in regulating MTA1 and its effect on the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (E-cadherinand Vimentin) were detected.
RESULTS: Compared with that in adjacent normal tissues and normal human intestinal epithelial cells, the miR-421expression level in CRC tissues and cells was significantly reduced. The potential target of miR-421 was analyzed by three public databases, in which we found that MTA1 was a direct target of miR-421, and miR-421 inhibited the proliferation, invasion, migration and EMT of CRC cells through the targeted regulation of the expression of target gene MTA1, thus effectively suppressing the ability of CRC cells.

30610554,Roles of Pin1 as a Key Molecule for EMT Induction by Activation of STAT3 and NF-κB in Human Gallbladder Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Despite developments in multidisciplinary treatment, the prognosis for advanced gallbladder cancer (GBC) still is poor because of its rapid progression. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a central role in promoting tumor invasion and metastasis in malignancies thorough signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation. Whereas Pin1 mediates STAT3 and NF-κB activation, the involvement of Pin1 in GBC progression is unclear.
METHODS: Factors regulating Pin1-related STAT3 and NF-κB activation were evaluated using surgical specimens collected from 76 GBC patients, GBC cells, and orthotopic GBC xenograft mice.
RESULTS: In the patients with GBC, high Pin1 expression in GBC was associated with aggressive tumor invasion and increased tumor metastasis, and was an independent factor for a poor prognosis. Pin1 expression was correlated with phosphorylation of STAT3(Ser727) and NF-κB-p65(Ser276), thereby activating STAT3 and NF-κB in GBC. Pin1-mediated STAT3 and NF-κB activation induced EMT in GBC. When Pin1 knockdown was performed in GBC cells, the phosphorylation of STAT3(Ser727) and NF-κB-p65(Ser276) was inhibited, and STAT3 and NF-κB activation was suppressed. Inactivation of STAT3 and NF-κB in Pin1-depleted cells decreased snail and zeb-2 expression, thereby reducing the rate of mesenchymal-like cells, suggesting that EMT was inhibited in GBC cells. PiB, a Pin1-specific inhibitor, inhibited EMT and reduced tumor cell invasion by inactivating STAT3 and NF-κB in vitro. Moreover, PiB treatment inhibited lymph node metastasis and intrahepatic metastasis in orthotopic GBC xenograft tumor in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: Pin1 accelerates GBC invasion and metastasis by activating STAT3 and NF-κB. Therefore, Pin1 inhibition by PiB is an excellent therapy for GBC by safely inhibiting its metastasis.",Ann.

30610490,Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition status of primary breast carcinomas and its correlation with metastatic behavior.,"BACKGROUND: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been implicated as an important step in the development of distant metastases. We therefore wished to study EMT status of primary breast carcinomas from patients who during follow-up developed distant metastases.
METHODS: mRNA expression profiles of primary breast carcinoma samples (n = 151) from patients who developed metastatic disease were analyzed and EMT status was designated using a previously described EMT-core signature. EMT status of the primary tumor was correlated to clinicopathological characteristics, molecular subtypes, metastasis pattern, chemotherapy response and survival outcomes. In addition, using immunohistochemistry, the expression levels of several proteins implicated in EMT were studied (CDH1, CDH2, NAT1, SNAI2, TWIST1, VIM, and ZEB1) compared with the designated EMT status and survival.
RESULTS: Utilizing the 130-gene-EMT-core signature, 66.2% of the primary tumors in the current study was assessed as EMT-activated. In contrast to our expectations, analyses revealed that 84.6% of Luminal A tumors, 65.1% of Luminal B tumors, and 55.6% of HER2-like had an activated EMT status, compared to only 25% of the basal-type tumors (p < 0.001). EMT status was not correlated to the pattern of metastatic disease, metastasis-specific survival, and overall survival. Similarly, there was not a significant association between EMT status of the primary tumor and chemotherapy response in the metastatic setting. Immunostaining for NAT1 and TWIST1 correlated with the EMT status (p 0.003 and p 0.047, respectively). Multivariate analyses showed that NAT1 and TWIST1 staining was significantly associated with EMT status regardless of the estrogen receptor status of the tumors (p values: 0.020 and 0.027, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The EMT status of breast cancers, as defined by the presence of a core EMT gene expression signature is associated with non-basal-type tumors, but not with the pattern of distant metastasis. Of several potential immunohistochemical EMT markers, only NAT1 and TWIST1 expression levels were associated with the gene expression-based EMT status.",Breast Cancer Res.

We selected six candidates (miR-126, 133b, 143, 203, 338-3p, 655) of tumour suppressor miRNAs in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) by a systematic review of NCBI database. Of these, miR-655 levels were significantly down-regulated in plasma of ESCC patients compared to healthy volunteers by test- and validation-scale analyses. Low levels of plasma miR-655 were significantly associated with lymphatic invasion, lymph node metastasis and advanced stage. Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that the low level of plasma miR-655 was an independent risk factor of lymphatic progression and a poor prognostic factor. Overexpression of miR-655 in ESCC cells inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Increased plasma miR-655 levels by the subcutaneous injection significantly inhibited lymph node metastasis in mice.

30609805,Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition in Human Mesothelial Cells Exposed to Asbestos Fibers: Role of TGF-β as Mediator of Malignant Mesothelioma Development or Metastasis via EMT Event.,"Asbestos exposure increases the risk of asbestosis and malignant mesothelioma (MM). Both fibrosis and cancer have been correlated with the Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)-an event involved in fibrotic development and cancer progression. During EMT, epithelial cells acquire a mesenchymal phenotype by modulating some proteins. Different factors can induce EMT, but Transforming Growth Factor β (TGF-β) plays a crucial role in promoting EMT. In this work, we verified if EMT could be associated with MM development. We explored EMT in human mesothelial cells (MeT-5A) exposed to chrysotile asbestos: we demonstrated that asbestos induces EMT in MeT-5A cells by downregulating epithelial markers E-cadherin, β-catenin, and occludin, and contemporarily, by upregulating mesenchymal markers fibronectin, α-SMA, and vimentin, thus promoting EMT. In these cells, this mechanism is mediated by increased TGF-β secretion, which in turn downregulates E-cadherin and increases fibronectin. These events are reverted in the presence of TGF-β antibody, via a Small Mother Against Decapentaplegic (SMAD)-dependent pathway and its downstream effectors, such as Zinc finger protein SNAI1 (SNAIL-1), Twist-related protein (Twist), and Zinc Finger E-Box Binding Homeobox 1 (ZEB-1), which downregulate the ",Int J Mol Sci,2019,"['Turini S', 'Bergandi L', 'Gazzano E', 'Prato M', 'Aldieri E']",

Expression levels of the TRIM 11 protein and the TRIM11 gene in prostate cancer, normal prostate tissue, and human prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 and DU145, were measured by Western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), respectively. Transfection with TRIM11 small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in gene knockdown. Transfection with a miR-5193 mimic resulted in overexpression of miR-5193. Proliferation and invasion assays were performed for PC3 and DU145 cells in vitro. RESULTS TRIM11 expression was upregulated in prostate cancer specimens compared with normal prostate tissue and was significantly correlated with reduced outcome. In human prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 and DU145, TRIM11 overexpression promoted cell proliferation. Upregulation of miR-5193 downregulated the expression of TRIM11. CONCLUSIONS TRIM11 was upregulated in prostate cancer tissue and was associated with reduced prognosis. TRIM11 expression increased cell proliferation in vitro and was downregulated by miR-5193.",Med. Sci. Monit.,2019,"['Pan Y', 'Zhang R', 'Chen H', 'Chen W', 'Wu K', 'Lv J']",
30607788,CEP55 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition in renal cell carcinoma through PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.,"PURPOSE: To study the detailed mechanisms of tumorigenesis and clinical outcomes of centrosomal protein 55 (CEP55) overexpression in renal cell carcinoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Microarray analysis was performed to explore differentially expressed genes in five pairs of RCC tissues. Data of CEP55 expression and corresponding clinical information for 532 RCC patients of TCGA database were downloaded from cBioPortal. The expression of CEP55 in RCC tissues and cells was determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Cells were transfected with siRNAs or lentivirus to regulate the expression of CEP55. The effects of CEP55 on proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of RCC cells were determined by MTS, migration and invasion assay and Western blot analysis.
RESULTS: CEP55, one of the most upregulated genes in microarray analysis, was overexpressed in RCC tissues and cells. CEP55 expression was significantly correlated with poor outcome including neoplasm disease stage, histologic grade and TNM status, as well as survival status of patients. In vitro experiments showed that downregulation of CEP55 could dramatically inhibit RCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion, while overexpression of CEP55 could promote these biological behaviors. We further demonstrated that CEP55 knockdown suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which was mediated via upregulation of E-cadherin and downregulation of N-cadherin and ZEB1, through PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. In contrast, overexpression of CEP55 could promote EMT in RCC cells via the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Importantly, inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway reduced the effects of CEP55 on the migration, invasion and EMT of RCC cells.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that CEP55 could promote EMT through PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and might be an effective prognostic marker in RCC.",Clin Transl Oncol,2019,"['Chen H', 'Zhu D', 'Zheng Z', 'Cai Y', 'Chen Z', 'Xie W']",
30606259,The prognostic and therapeutic implications of circulating tumor cell phenotype detection based on epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers in the first-line chemotherapy of HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is implicated in the metastatic process and presents a challenge to epithelial cell adhesion molecule-based detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), which have been demonstrated to be a prognostic indicator in metastatic breast cancer. Although evidence has indicated that heterogeneity of CTCs based on EMT markers is associated with disease progression, no standard recommendations have been established for clinical practice. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of dynamic CTC detection based on EMT for metastatic breast cancer patients.
METHODS: We enrolled 108 human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer patients from the prospective phase III CAMELLIA study and applied the CanPatrol CTC enrichment technique to identify CTC phenotypes (including epithelial CTCs, biphenotypic epithelial/mesenchymal CTCs, and mesenchymal CTCs) in peripheral blood samples. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses of total CTC count and the proportion of mesenchymal CTCs for predicting the 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate were conducted to determine the optimal cut-off values, and Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis were performed to investigate the prognostic value of the cut-off values of both total CTC count and the proportion of mesenchymal CTCs in combination.
RESULTS: For predicting the 1-year PFS rate, the optimal cut-off value of total CTC count was 9.5 (Area under the curve [AUC] = 0.538, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.418-0.657), and that of the proportion of mesenchymal CTCs was 10.7% (AUC = 0.581, 95% CI = 0.463-0.699). We used the two cut-off values in combination to forecast PFS in which the total CTC count was equaled to or exceeded 10/5 mL with the proportion of mesenchymal CTCs surpassed 10.7%. Patients who met the combined criteria had significantly shorter median PFS than did those who did not meet the criteria (6.2 vs. 9.9 months, P =0.010). A nomogram was constructed based on the criteria and significant clinicopathological characteristics with a C-index of 0.613 (P = 0.010).
CONCLUSIONS: The criteria, which combine the total CTC count and the proportion of mesenchymal CTCs, may be used to monitor therapeutic resistance and predict prognosis in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

30601064,Long Noncoding RNA-ATB Impairs the Function of Tumor Suppressor miR-126-Mediated Signals in Endometrial Cancer for Tumor Growth and Metastasis.,"OBJECTIVE: Long non-coding RNA-ATB (Lnc-ATB) have been reported to promote tumor proliferation and metastasis via regulation of tumor suppressive miRNA-related signals. Patients with endometrial cancer (EC) have advanced stage disease or metastasis have poor prognosis. We here investigated the role of Lnc-ATB in endometrial cancer.
METHODS: Endometrial cancer tissues and normal tissues (n = 35) were collected to determine the expression and clinical significance of Lnc-ATB, and bioinformatics analysis was used to predict the miRNA target. siRNA was used to estimate the function of Lnc-ATB in EC cell lines and in vivo.
RESULT: The expression of Lnc-ATB is up-regulated in tumor tissues and EC cell lines. Patients with high expressed Lnc-ATB have high FIGO stage and poor tumor differentiation. The tumor suppressor miR-126 interacted with Lnc-ATB. Down-regulated miR-126 negative correlated with FIGO stage and tumor differentiation. Knockdown of Lnc-ATB in RL95 and HEC1A cell lines increased the miR-126 level and impaired the cell vitality, induced caspase-3-related tumor apoptosis and G1/S arrest. However, abrogation of miR-126 by its inhibitors counteracted Lnc-ATB knockdown-induced tumor inhibition via regulation of miR-126 target gene PIK3R2 and Sox2-related apoptosis and cell cycle pathway. Meanwhile, Lnc-ATB knockdown also suppressed the migration and invasion and inhibited TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype via miR-126. Knockdown of Lnc-ATB in vivo remarkably induced tumor regression via restoration of tumor suppressor miR-126, leading to deceased tumor volume, reduced expression of PCNA and PIK3R2/Sox2 signals and EMT phenotype in tumor tissues.
CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate the tumorigenic role of Lnc-ATBs in endometrial cancer via abrogation of tumor suppressor miR-126 signals.",Cancer Biother. Radiopharm.,2019,"['Zheng X', 'Liu M', 'Song Y', 'Feng C']",
30600477,Plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI2) inhibits invasive potential of hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro via uPA- and RB/E2F1-related mechanisms.,"BACKGROUND: Plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI2) has been shown to be associated with invasive phenotypes and prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its biological roles and underlying mechanisms in invasion of HCC have not been explored. The present study aimed to address the issues.
METHODS: First, sub-lines in that PAI2 was stably overexpressed and silenced were established based on MHCC97H and BEL7402 cell lines, respectively. Wound-healing and transwell assays were applied to evaluate cell migration and invasion. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) activity was measured using an ELISA kit. Real-time RT-PCR and western blotting were used to show gene expression at mRNA and protein levels. E2F1 expression in human specimens was determined by tissue microarray-based immunohistochemical staining.
RESULTS: The sub-lines, MHCC97H-PAI2 and BEL7402-siPAI2, were successfully established. The two sub-lines carried much lower and higher migration and invasion powers, respectively, in contrast to the controls. In MHCC97H-PAI2 sub-line, intra-medium uPA activity was significantly decreased, while RB expression was obviously elevated, compared with the controls. The BEL7402-siPAI2 sub-line presented the opposite trend. To identify the role of RB/E2F1 pathway, we transiently overexpressed E2F1 in MHCC97H-PAI2 sub-line, and largely reversed the inhibitory effects of PAI2 on cell migration and invasion, through regulating multiple matrix metalloproteinases and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In HCC specimens, E2F1 expression was much higher in tumor than in non-tumor tissues, and was significantly related to Edmondson-Steiner grade, overall as well as tumor-free survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that PAI2 inhibits invasive potential of HCC cells via uPA- and RB/E2F1-related mechanisms.",Hepatol Int,2019,"['Jin Y', 'Liang ZY', 'Zhou WX', 'Zhou L']",

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been documented to increase motility and invasiveness of cancer cells, which promotes cancer metastasis.
PURPOSE: This study aims to investigate the inhibitory effects and mechanisms of the dinorditerpenoids and norditerpenoids isolated from the seeds of Podocarpus nagi against transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1-induced EMT.
METHODS: A series of dinorditerpenoids and norditerpenoids were isolated from the seeds of P. nagi. Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR assays were performed to determine the expression levels of relative proteins and mRNA, along with immunofluorescence, Smad-binding element (SBE)-luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays for the mechanism study. Transwell assays were conducted to determine the effect of the compounds on cell migration and invasion.
RESULTS: Nagilactone E (NLE) showed the superior inhibitory effect against TGF-β1-induced EMT. NLE treatment dramatically inhibited TGF-β1-induced expression of EMT markers in A549 cells. Mechanism study indicated that NLE markedly suppressed TGF-β1-induced Smad2 and Smad3 activation and nuclear translocation. SBE-luciferase and ChIP assays showed that NLE inhibited the combining of Smad3 to SBE in the promoters of the cell signaling factors. NLE co-treatment attenuated TGF-β1-induced up-regulation of the protein and mRNA levels of TGF-β receptor TβRI. Furthermore, NLE inhibited TGF-β1-stimulated cell migration and invasion, as well as up-regulation of the key signaling proteins related with migration and invasion.
CONCLUSION: NLE inhibited TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, thereafter suppressed TGF-β1-induced EMT, migration and invasion in NSCLC A549 cells.",Phytomedicine,2019,"['Zhang LL', 'Jiang XM', 'Huang MY', 'Feng ZL', 'Chen X', 'Wang Y', 'Li H', 'Li A', 'Lin LG', 'Lu JJ']",

In the present study, our data showed that lncRNA MAF BZIP Transcription Factor G Antisense RNA 1 (MAFG-AS1) was over-expressed in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of MAFG-AS1 promoted the migration, invasion and enhanced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of NSCLC cell. In addition, miR-339-5p was predicted to be a target of MAFG-AS1 and the level of miR-339-5p was down-regulated in NSCLC. Over-expression of MAFG-AS1 significantly decreased the level of miR-339-5p in NSCLC cell. Moreover, the matrix metalloproteinase 15 (MMP15) was identified to be a target of miR-339-5p. The level of MMP15 was negatively regulated by miR-339-5p whereas positively controlled by MAFG-AS1. In addition, up-regulation of miR-339-5p neutralized the promoting impact of MAFG-AS1 on the migration, invasion and EMT of NSCLC cell. Finally, the xenograft model suggested that MAFG-AS1 promoted the metastasis of NSCLC cell in vivo. Altogether, we proved that MAFG-AS1-miR-339-5p-MMP15 axis might be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of patients with NSCLC.",Cell Biol.

30597907,Transforming Growth Factor-β Promotes Morphomechanical Effects Involved in Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition in Living Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"The epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a physiological multistep process involving epithelial cells acquiring a mesenchymal-like phenotype. It is widely demonstrated that EMT is linked to tumor progression and metastasis. The transforming growth factor (TGF)-β pathways have been widely investigated, but its role in the hepatocarcinoma EMT is still unclear. While the biochemical pathways have been extensively studied, the alteration of biomechanical behavior correlated to cellular phenotype and motility is not yet fully understood. To better define the involvement of TGF-β1 in the metastatic progression process in different hepatocarcinoma cell lines (HepG2, PLC/PRF/5, HLE), we applied a systematic morphomechanical approach in order to investigate the physical and the structural characteristics. In addition, we evaluated the antitumor effect of LY2157299, a TGF-βR1 kinase inhibitor, from a biomechanical point of view, using Atomic Force and Confocal Microscopy.

30597648,Integrative analysis of copy number and gene expression data identifies potential oncogenic drivers that promote mammary tumor recurrence.,"Tumor recurrence represents a significant clinical challenge in the treatment and management of breast cancer. To investigate whether copy number aberrations (CNAs) facilitate the re-emergence of tumor growth from residual disease, we performed array comparative genomic hybridization on primary and recurrent mammary tumors from an inducible mouse model of type-I insulin-like growth factor receptor driven breast cancer. This genome-wide analysis revealed primary and recurrent tumors harbored distinct CNAs with relapsed tumors containing an increased number of gene-level gains and losses. Remarkably, high-level CNAs detected in primary tumors were largely devoid of annotated cancer genes while the vast majority of recurrent tumors harbored at least one CNA containing a known oncogene or tumor suppressor. Specifically, 38% of recurrent tumors carried gains at 6qA2 and 9qA2 which encode the Met and Yap1 oncogenes, respectively. The most frequent CNA, occurring in 63% of recurrent tumors, was a focal deletion at 4qC5 involving the Cdkn2a/b tumor suppressor genes. Integrative analysis revealed positive correlations between gene copy number and mRNA expression suggesting Met, Yap1, and Cdkn2a/b may serve as potential drivers that promote tumor recurrence. Accordingly, cross-species analysis revealed gene-level murine CNAs were present in a subset of human breast cancers with high MET and YAP1 mRNA predictive of decreased relapse-free survival in basal-like breast cancers. Together, these findings indicate that tumor recurrence is facilitated by the acquisition of CNAs with oncogenic potential and provide a framework to dissect the molecular mechanisms that mediate tumor escape from dormancy.",Genes Chromosomes Cancer,2019,"['Jones RA', 'Moorehead RA']",
30594557,TNF-α is a potential therapeutic target to overcome sorafenib resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: The role of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in targeted therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains largely unknown. The current study aimed to clarify the mechanistic effects of targeting TNF-α to overcome sorafenib resistance in HCC.
METHODS: A correlation of TNF-α expression with the prognosis was analyzed in 62 HCC patients who underwent surgical resection and subsequent received adjuvant sorafenib treatment. The relation of TNF-α expression and sorafenib sensitivity was determined in different HCC cell lines. The combined therapeutic effects of sorafenib and ulinastatin, which could inhibit TNF-α expression, on HCC were examined in vitro and in vivo.
FINDINGS: High TNF-α expression was correlated with poor outcomes in HCC patients who received adjuvant sorafenib after surgery. In vitro experiments showed that TNF-α promotes HCC cell resistant to sorafenib through inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Notably, the current study revealed that sorafenib has no significant influence on the expression and secretion of TNF-α, and sorafenib had limited effectiveness on reversing EMT in HCC cells with high TNF-α expression. Inhibiting the expression of TNF-α with ulinastatin significantly enhanced the anti-tumor effect of sorafenib on HCC cells with high expression of TNF-α in vitro and in vivo.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that TNF-α may serve as a novel predictor of sorafenib sensitivity in HCC patients. Sorafenib combined with ulinastatin may improve the effectiveness of treatment of HCC in patients with high expression of TNF-α.

In cancer, EMT is associated with tumor initiation, invasion, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. Recently, it has been demonstrated that EMT is not a binary process, but occurs through distinct cellular states. Here, we review the recent studies that demonstrate the existence of these different EMT states in cancer and the mechanisms regulating their functions. We discuss the different functional characteristics, such as proliferation, propagation, plasticity, invasion, and metastasis associated with the distinct EMT states.

30592286,miR‑498 inhibits the growth and metastasis of liver cancer by targeting ZEB2.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in the growth, metastasis and therapeutic resistance of liver cancer. Accumulating evidence suggests that miR‑498 is aberrantly expressed in several human malignancies. However, the role and underlying mechanism of miR‑498 in liver cancer remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the potential roles and clinical value of miR‑498 in liver cancer. We found that the miR‑498 expression level was significantly lower in liver cancer patient tissues than that in healthy control tissues. The expression of miR‑498 was also decreased in liver cancer cell lines compared to that noted in a normal human normal liver cell line. miR‑498 overexpression markedly inhibited liver cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. miR‑498 overexpression induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis while it suppressed epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) in liver cancer cells. Bioinformatic analysis and luciferase reporter assay further identified zinc finger E‑box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) as a novel target of miR‑498. Furthermore, ZEB2 knockdown recapitulated the inhibitory effects of miR‑498 overexpression in liver cancer cells. ZEB2 overexpression rescued the inhibition of liver cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by miR‑498, indicating that ZEB2 acts as a downstream effector of miR‑498 in liver cancer cells. Thus, we demonstrated that miR‑498 suppresses the growth and metastasis of liver cancer cells, partly at least, by directly targeting ZEB2, suggesting that miR‑498 may serve as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and therapy of liver cancer.",Oncol.

The present study demonstrated that CCL18 expression was significantly associated with advanced clinical stages of BC. Furthermore, exogenous CCL18 promoted cell invasion and migration, and induced cell epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) in BC cells. Western blotting demonstrated that E‑cadherin, an epithelial marker, was decreased, whereas matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)‑2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)‑C were increased in CCL18‑treated cells. Blocking CCR8 via a small molecule inhibitor or short hairpin (sh)RNA mitigated the decrease in E‑cadherin, and increase in MMP‑2 and VEGF‑C, caused by human recombinant (r)CCL18. CCR8 knockdown by shRNA reversed rCCL18‑induced cancer cell invasion, migration and EMT.

However, the mechanism underlying the role of the lncRNA and miRNA‑101 in OS remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, through reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, it was first found that the lncRNA SNHG1 was upregulated and miRNA‑101‑3p was downregulated in OS tissues and cell lines. Second, the knockdown of lncRNA SNHG1 induced cell apoptosis and maintained the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase, which decreased the overall cell viability. Furthermore, according to a dual‑luciferase assay and western blot analysis, miRNA‑101‑3p was found to be a target of the lncRNA SNHG1 in OS, which further regulated the expression of Rho‑associated coiled‑coil‑containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1). It was found that the phosphoinositide 3‑kinase/ATK pathway was inactivated and that epithelial‑mesenchymal transition was activated in OS cell lines with overexpression of the lncRNA SNHG1. Taken together, in OS cell lines, the lncRNA SNHG1 acted as an oncogene, and miRNA‑101‑3p was considered a tumor suppressor.

30591423,Tumor Initiation Capacity and Therapy Resistance Are Differential Features of EMT-Related Subpopulations in the NSCLC Cell Line A549.,"Cell lines are essential tools to standardize and compare experimental findings in basic and translational cancer research. The current dogma states that cancer stem cells feature an increased tumor initiation capacity and are also chemoresistant. Here, we identified and comprehensively characterized three morphologically distinct cellular subtypes in the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 and challenge the current cancer stem cell dogma. Subtype-specific cellular morphology is maintained during short-term culturing, resulting in the formation of holoclonal, meroclonal, and paraclonal colonies. A549 holoclone cells were characterized by an epithelial and stem-like phenotype, paraclone cells featured a mesenchymal phenotype, whereas meroclone cells were phenotypically intermediate. Cell-surface marker expression of subpopulations changed over time, indicating an active epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), in vitro and in vivo. EMT has been associated with the overexpression of the immunomodulators PD-L1 and PD-L2, which were 37- and 235-fold overexpressed in para- versus holoclone cells, respectively. We found that DNA methylation is involved in epigenetic regulation of marker expression. Holoclone cells were extremely sensitive to cisplatin and radiotherapy in vitro, whereas paraclone cells were highly resistant. However, inhibition of the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL, whose expression is associated with an EMT, specifically targeted the otherwise highly resistant paraclone cells. Xenograft tumor formation capacity was 24- and 269-fold higher in holo- than mero- and paraclone cells, respectively.

Nowadays, molecular targeted therapy has been the first-line treatment for NSCLC.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a biological phenomenon in which epithelial cells are transformed into mesenchymal cells. EMT promoted metastasis, invasion of lung cancer and conferred characteristic of stem cell on cancer cells. Meanwhile, EMT is one of an important cause of EGFR-TKIs resistance in NSCLC. The recent studies have found that resistant cells restored the sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs by reversing EMT which suggested that the target of EMT may contribute to inhibit or even reverse the resistance of EGFR-TKIs.

30590004,KIF11 Functions as an Oncogene and Is Associated with Poor Outcomes from Breast Cancer.,"PURPOSE: The study aimed to search and identify genes that were differentially expressed in breast cancer, and their roles in cancer growth and progression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Gene Expression Omnibus (Oncomine) and The Cancer Genome Atlas databases (https://cancergenome.nih.gov/) were screened for genes that were expressed differentially in breast cancer and were closely related to a poor prognosis. Gene expressions were verified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and genes were knocked down by a lentivirus-based system. Cell growth and motility were evaluated and in vivo nude mice were used to confirm the in vitro roles of genes. Markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and the associations of KIF11 with the classical cancer signaling pathways were detected by Western blot.
RESULTS: A series of genes expressed differentially in patients with breast cancer. The prognosis associated with high KIF11 expression was poor, and the expression of KIF11 increased significantly in high stage and malignant tumor cells. Inhibiting KIF11 expression in lentivirus-suppressed cells revealed that KIF11 inhibition significantly reduced cell viability and colony formation, inhibited migration and invasion, but promoted apoptosis. The sizes and weights of KIF11-inhibited tumors in nude mice were significantly lower than in the negative controls. Western blot showed that E-cadherin in breast cancer was significantly upregulated in KIF-inhibited cells and tumor tissues, whereas N-cadherin and vimentin were significantly downregulated. BT549 and MDA231 cells with KIF11 knockdown exhibited decreased ERK, AMPK, AKT, and CREB phosphorylation.

30589983,Phosphorylation status at Smad3 linker region modulates transforming growth factor-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer progression.,"Smad3, a major transcription factor in transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling, plays critical roles in both tumor-suppressive and pro-oncogenic functions. Upon TGF-β stimulation, the C-terminal tail of Smad3 undergoes phosphorylation that is essential for canonical TGF-β signaling. The Smad3 linker region contains serine/threonine phosphorylation sites and can be phosphorylated by intracellular kinases, such as the MAPK family, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) family and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). Previous reports based on cell culture studies by us and others showed that mutation of Smad3 linker phosphorylation sites dramatically intensifies TGF-β responses as well as growth-inhibitory function and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), suggesting that Smad3 linker phosphorylation suppresses TGF-β transcriptional activities. However, recent discoveries of Smad3-interacting molecules that preferentially bind phosphorylated Smad3 linker serine/threonine residues have shown a multitude of signal transductions that either enhance or suppress TGF-β responses associated with Smad3 turnover or cancer progression. This review aims at providing new insight into the perplexing mechanisms of TGF-β signaling affected by Smad3 linker phosphorylation and further attempts to gain insight into elimination and protection of TGF-β-mediated oncogenic and growth-suppressive signals, respectively.",Cancer Sci.,2019,"['Ooshima A', 'Park J', 'Kim SJ']",

Here, we show through a mechanism-based dynamical model that the diffusion of EMT-inducing signals such as TGF-β, together with noncell autonomous control of EMT and CSC decision making via the Notch signaling pathway, can explain experimentally observed disparate localization of subsets of CSCs with varying EMT phenotypes in the tumor. Our simulations show that the more mesenchymal CSCs lie at the invasive edge, while the hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) CSCs reside in the tumor interior. Further, motivated by the role of Notch-Jagged signaling in mediating EMT and stemness, we investigated the microenvironmental factors that promote Notch-Jagged signaling. We show that many inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 that can promote Notch-Jagged signaling can (",Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

30587496,The Functional Role of Prostate Cancer Metastasis-related Micro-RNAs.,"The mortality of patients with hormone-resistant prostate cancer can be ascribed to a large degree to metastasis to distant organs, predominantly to the bones. In this review, we discuss the contribution of micro-RNAs (miRs) to the metastatic process of prostate cancer. The criteria for selection of miRs for this review were the availability of preclinical in vivo metastasis-related data in conjunction with prognostic clinical data. Depending on their function in the metastatic process, the corresponding miRs are up- or down-regulated in prostate cancer tissues when compared to matching normal tissues. Up-regulated miRs preferentially target suppressors of cytokine signaling or tumor suppressor-related genes and metastasis-inhibitory transcription factors. Down-regulated miRs promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition or mesenchymal-epithelial transition and diverse pro-metastatic signaling pathways. Some of the discussed miRs exert their function by simultaneously targeting epigenetic pathways as well as cell-cycle-related, anti-apoptotic and signaling-promoting targets. Finally, we discuss potential therapeutic options for the treatment of prostate cancer-related metastases by substitution or inhibition of miRs.",Cancer Genomics Proteomics,2019,"['Weidle UH', 'Epp A', 'Birzele F', 'Brinkmann U']",
30586675,"TGF-β as Multifaceted Orchestrator in HCC Progression: Signaling, EMT, Immune Microenvironment, and Novel Therapeutic Perspectives.","Therapeutic attempts to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) frequently result in a poor response or treatment failure. The efficacy of approved drugs and survival expectancies is affected by an ample degree of variability that can be explained at least in part by the enormous between-patient cellular and molecular heterogeneity of this neoplasm. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is hyperactivated in a large fraction of HCCs, where it influences complex interactive networks covering multiple cell types and a plethora of other local soluble ligands, ultimately establishing several malignancy traits. This cytokine boosts the invasiveness of cancerous epithelial cells through promoting the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition program, but also skews the phenotype of immune cells toward a tumor-supporting status. Here, we discuss recent strategies pursued to offset TGF-β-dependent processes that promote metastatic progression and immune surveillance escape in solid cancers, including HCC. Moreover, we report findings indicating that TGF-β reduces the expression of the proinflammatory factors CCL4 and interleukin-1β (IL-1β in human ex vivo treated HCC tissues. While this is consistent with the anti-inflammatory properties of TGF-β, whether it is an outright tumor promoter or suppressor is still a matter of some debate. Indeed, IL-1β has also been shown to support angiogenesis and cell invasiveness in some cancers. In addition, we describe an inhibitory effect of TGF-β on the secretion of CCL2 and CXCL1 by HCC-derived fibroblasts, which suggests the existence of an indirect stroma-mediated functional link between TGF-β and downstream immunity.",Semin.

DPP-4 has been widely recognized as a therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes mellitus but is also implicated in the development of human malignancies. Here, we show that inhibition of DPP-4 accelerates breast cancer metastasis via induction of CXCL12/CXCR4, which activates mTOR to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In cultured cells, DPP-4 knockdown induced EMT and cell migration.

In this study, we found that Med19 was obviously elevated in human breast cancer tissues, which was significantly associated with larger tumors, high-grade malignant features and poor prognosis. Furthermore, Med19 enhanced breast cancer cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion and migration in vitro and in vivo. Med19 interacted with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and increased EGFR expression. Moreover, Med19 activated the EGFR/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and exerted its oncogenic activity in an EGFR signaling-mediated manner. In addition, Med19 expression was regulated by miR-101-3p and miR-422a. Med19 expression positively correlated with EGFR expression and negatively correlated with miR-101-3p and miR-422a expression in human breast cancer tissues. Med19 mediated the crosstalk between miR-101-3p/miR-422a and the EGFR/MEK/ERK signaling pathway.

30583038,MicroRNA Biomarkers for Patients With Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer Undergoing Selective Bladder-Sparing Trimodality Treatment.,"PURPOSE: Trimodality therapy with maximal transurethral resection of bladder tumor and definitive chemoradiation reserving cystectomy for salvage of local recurrence is an accepted treatment alternative to upfront cystectomy for selected patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer. There is a need for molecular biomarkers to predict which patients will respond to bladder preservation therapy.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: We sought to identify biomarkers with the ability to predict response to chemoradiation and survival after selective bladder preservation therapy in a cohort of 40 patients using a microRNA profiling approach. In vitro experiments were performed using transitional cell carcinoma lines CRL1749, HTB5, and HTB4.
RESULTS: We identified a panel of microRNAs associated with overall survival in our bladder preservation cohort and in the TCGA cohort. We also identified several microRNAs, including miR-23a and miR-27a, microRNAs of the miR-23a cluster, to be suggestively associated with complete response to chemoradiation therapy. The microRNAs were significantly associated with overall survival in The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort. In vitro studies suggest that the functional roles of miR-23a and miR-27a involve targeting the SFRP1 protein, a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway. The upregulation of β-catenin in the Wnt signaling pathway mediated proliferation, migration, invasion, and sensitivity to radiation and cisplatin treatment in bladder cancer cells.

Alpha-enolase (ENO1), as a prominent glycolytic enzyme, is upregulated in multiple cancers and its overexpression is involved in tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the potential role of ENO1 in the development and progression of gastric cancer (GC). Here, we found that ENO1 expression was upregulated in human GC and was associated with Lauren type, lymph node metastasis (LNM) and TNM stage. Knockdown of ENO1 attenuated GC cell proliferation and metastasis and reversed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progress in vitro while ENO1 overexpression did the opposite. ENO1 could modulate AKT signaling pathway in GC cells and the enhanced proliferation and migration ability induced by ENO1 overexpression was impaired after incubation with PI3K inhibitor Ly294002 in SGC7901 cells.

30579335,Effect of RSK4 on biological characteristics of colorectal cancer.,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the expression of P90 Ribosomal Protein S6 kinase 4 (RSK4) in colorectal cancer cells and its biological function.
METHODS: We selected early SW480 and HCT116 colorectal cancer cell lines, using Lipofectamine™ 2000 transfection reagent carrying RSK4 gene transfected into cells to establish the colorectal cancer cell lines with high expression of RSK4. RT-PCR and western blot (WB) analysis confirmed RSK4 expression in SW480 and HCT116 cancer cell lines. We used methylthiazoltetrazolium (MTT) assay and flow cytometry to detect the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells. After transfection of RSK4, the effect of RSK4 on the RNA levels associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of colorectal cancer cells was analyzed by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR and the expression of EMT-related protein was detected by WB analysis.
RESULTS: After transfection of RSK4 overexpression, the MTT assay detected that RSK4 could significantly inhibit the growth of colorectal cancer cells in vitro; flow cytometry detected that S-phase cells decreased significantly, and G0/1 cells increased significantly (P < 0.05). The invasion ability of SW480 and HCT116 cells transfected with RSK4 was markedly lower than that in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Fluorescent quantitative PCR and WB analysis showed that the expression of EMT-associated molecular E-cadherin was remarkably increased and the expression of Snail was significantly decreased (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: RSK4 gene in colorectal cancer cell lines with low expression of RSK4 after transfection can inhibit the growth and invasion of tumor cells. RSK4 gene may inhibit EMT and inhibit metastasis of colorectal cancer cells, may be a potential tumor suppressor gene and inhibit tumor distant metastasis, and may provide the biological basis for new therapeutic targets.",World J Surg Oncol,2018,"['Ye Q', 'Wang X', 'Jin M', 'Wang M', 'Hu Y', 'Yu S', 'Yang Y', 'Yang J', 'Cai J']",
30579251,"Radio resistance in breast cancer cells is mediated through TGF-β signalling, hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal phenotype and cancer stem cells.","AIMS: A major obstacle for effective cancer treatment by radiation therapy is the development of radio-resistance and identification of underlying mechanisms and activated pathways will lead to better combination therapies.
MAIN METHODS: Irradiated MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines were characterised following different recovery periods. Proliferation was assessed by MTT, BrdU and clonogenic assays and apoptosis by Annexin V/ propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. Gene expression was monitored by real time PCR/ELISA/antibody labelling and migration using transwell inserts.
KEY FINDINGS: Breast cancer cell lines exposed to 6 Gy followed by recovery period for 7 days (D7-6 G) had increased ability for proliferation as well as apoptosis. D7-6 G from both cell lines had increased expression of transforming growth factor isoforms (TGF)-β1, β2 and β3, their receptors TGF-βR1 and TGF-βR2 which are known for such dual effects. The expression of downstream transcription factors Snail, Zeb-1 and HMGA2 also showed a differential pattern in D7-6 G cells with upregulation of at least two of these transcription factors. D7-6 G cells from both cell lines displayed hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal (E/M) phenotype with increased expression of E/M markers and migration. D7-6 G cells had increased expression of cancer stem cells markers Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog; aldehyde dehydrogenase expression and activity; proportion of CD44

30578966,A specific lipid metabolic profile is associated with the epithelial mesenchymal transition program.,"Several studies have identified a specific metabolic program that is associated with the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Whereas much is known about the association between glucose metabolism and EMT, the contribution of lipid metabolism is not still completely understood. Here, we studied epithelial and mesenchymal breast cancer cells by proteomic and lipidomic approaches and identified significant differences that characterised these models concerning specific metabolic enzymes and metabolites including fatty acids and phospholipids. Higher levels of monounsaturated fatty acids together with increased expression of enzymes of de novo fatty acid synthesis is the distinct signature of epithelial with respect to mesenchymal cells that, on the contrary, show reduced lipogenesis, higher polyunsaturated fatty acids level and increased expression of genes involved in the triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis and lipid droplets formation. In the mesenchymal model, the diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT)-1 appears to be the major enzyme involved in TAG synthesis and inhibition of DGAT1, but not DGAT2, drastically reduces the incorporation of labeled palmitate into TAG.

30577808,SIRT6 drives epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer via snail-dependent transrepression of KLF4.,"BACKGROUND: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to the invasion and metastasis of epithelial tumors. Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), an NAD-dependent deacetylase, is known to promote metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: In this work, we determined the role of SIRT6 in the EMT of NSCLC cells and identified the key EMT-related genes involved in the oncogenic activity of SIRT6.
RESULTS: We report that depletion of SIRT6 inhibits transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-induced EMT in A549 and H1299 NSCLC cells, which is rescued by ectopic expression of SIRT6. Knockdown of SIRT6 leads to a reduction in Snail protein without affecting the mRNA level. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate a physical association between SIRT6 and Snail. SIRT6 deacetylates Snail and prevents its proteasomal degradation. Silencing of Snail blunts SIRT6-induced NSCLC cell migration and invasion, while overexpression of Snail restores the invasion and EMT in SIRT6-depleted NSCLC cells. SIRT6 depletion leads to an upregulation of kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) and reduced Snail binding to the promoter of Klf4 in NSCLC cells. Knockdown of KLF4 rescues the invasive capacity in SIRT6-depleted NSCLC cells. Conversely, co-expression of KLF4 impairs SIRT6-induced aggressive behavior. In vivo data further demonstrate that SIRT6-induced NSCLC metastasis is antagonized by overexpression of KLF4.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide mechanistic insights into the pro-metastatic activity of SIRT6 and highlight the role of the SIRT6/Snail/KLF4 axis in regulating EMT and invasion of NSCLC cells.",J. Exp. Clin. Cancer Res.,2018,"['Li Z', 'Huang J', 'Shen S', 'Ding Z', 'Luo Q', 'Chen Z', 'Lu S']",
30577767,Semaphorin-5A maintains epithelial phenotype of malignant pancreatic cancer cells.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly aggressive disease, and the lethality of this disease stems from early metastatic dissemination where surgical removal cannot provide a cure. Improvement of the therapeutic outcome and overall survival of PC patients requires to understand the fundamental processes that lead to metastasis such as the gain of cellular migration ability. One such family of proteins, which are essential players of cellular migration, is Semaphorin. Previously, we have identified one of the Semaphorin family member, Semaphorin-5A (SEMA5A) to be involved in organ-specific homing during PC metastasis. We have also demonstrated that SEMA5A has a constitutive expression in PC cell lines derived from metastatic sites in comparison with low endogenous expression in the primary tumor-derived cell line. In this study, we examined whether constitutive SEMA5A expression in metastatic PC cells regulates tumor growth and metastatic potential.
METHODS: We generated SEMA5A knockdown in T3M-4 and CD18/HPAF cells and assessed their phenotypes on in vitro motility, tumor growth, and metastatic progression.
RESULTS: In contrary to our initial expectations, orthotopic injection of SEMA5A knockdown cells into nude mice resulted in a significant increase in both tumor burden and liver metastases in comparison with the Control cells. Similarly, we observed higher in vitro migratory potential with pronounced morphological changes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a decrease in the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin (E-Cad), increase in the expression of mesenchymal markers N-cadherin (N-Cad) and Snail and the activation of the Wnt-signaling pathway in SEMA5A knockdown cells. Furthermore, re-establishing SEMA5A expression with a knockdown resistant mouse Sema5A in SEMA5A knockdown cells resulted in a reversion to the epithelial state (mesenchymal-epithelial transition; MET), as indicated by the rescue of E-Cad expression and a decrease in N-Cad and Snail expression.

30577521,From Tumor Immunology to Immunotherapy in Gastric and Esophageal Cancer.,"Esophageal and gastric cancers represent tumors with poor prognosis. Unfortunately, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy have made only limited progress in recent years in improving the generally disappointing outcome. Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors is a novel treatment approach that quickly entered clinical practice in malignant melanoma and renal cell cancer, but the role in esophageal and gastric cancer is still poorly defined. The principal prognostic/predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy efficacy currently considered are PD-L1 expression along with defects in mismatch repair genes resulting in microsatellite instability (MSI-H) phenotype. The new molecular classification of gastric cancer also takes these factors into consideration. Available reports regarding PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2 expression and MSI status in gastric and esophageal cancer are reviewed to summarize the clinical prognostic and predictive role together with potential clinical implications.

SAR studies on the first-in-class AGPS inhibitor 1, discovered by our group, led to the 2,6-difluoro analog 2i which showed higher binding affinity than 1in vitro. In 231MFP cancer cells, 2i reduced ether lipids levels and cell migration rate. When tested in PC-3 and MDA-MB-231 cancer cells, 2i specifically impaired epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) by modulating E-cadherin, Snail and MMP2 expression levels. Moreover, the combination of siRNAs against AGPS and 2i provided no additive effect, confirming that the modulation of 2i on EMT specifically relies on AGPS inhibition.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 116 patients who had previously undergone complete resection of the tumor for LSCC were studied retrospectively. The ILK expression level in tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues were determined by immunohistochemistry. The changes of ILK expression from each group were assessed and correlated to the clinical parameters of the patients. Secondly, ILK antisense oligonucleotide (ILK-ASONS) was used to silence the ILK gene of LSCC cell from Hep-2 cell line. The expression of ILK, epithelial marker E-cadherin and mesenchymal marker Vimentin were evaluated by Western blotting. The proliferation of cells after transfection was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). The apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. The migration and invasion activity of Hep-2 cells was detected by Matrigel invasion and cell migration assays.
RESULTS: The expression of the ILK protein was significantly associated with tumor differentiation (p=0.046), lymph node metastasis (p=0.020) and pTNM stage (p=0.019). ILK ASONS-transfected cells showed a significant decrease in cell proliferation, cell migration and invasive activity compared to mock-transfected cells. ILK ASONS-transfected cells increased the expression of E-cadherin, whereas the expression of ILK and Vimentin decreased, compared with mock-transfected cells.
CONCLUSIONS: The expression of ILK was significantly correlated with differentiation and metastasis of the laryngeal carcinomas.

RESULTS: PODXL expression was significantly up-regulated in both CRC tissues and cell lines. In vitro experiments showed the knockdown of PODXL suppressed reduces CRC tumor growth, metastasis and EMT, and promoted apoptosis. Moreover, PODXL was predicted and confirmed to be a target of miR-138. In addition, ectopic expression of PODXL significantly reversed the suppression of cell proliferation and metastasis caused by the miR-138 over-expression.

30575817,Long noncoding RNA CRCMSL suppresses tumor invasive and metastasis in colorectal carcinoma through nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of HMGB2.,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are pervasive transcripts that play pivotal roles in regulating chromatin dynamics, gene and protein expression. Aberrant expression and mutations of lncRNAs represent a driving force behind tumor invasion and metastasis, making them attractive cancer targets. However, most of the lncRNAs are still being discovered and conclusive experimental evidence for their functional relevance is still lacking for most malignancies. In this study, a differentially expressed lncRNA, designated as lnc-CRCMSL, is identified by microarray-based screenings on non-metastatic and metastatic CRC specimens. Lnc-CRCMSL is verified as an anti-metastatic gene and negatively correlated with the poor prognosis of CRC patients. Lnc-CRCMSL overexpression restricts tumor growth and metastasis in vivo and in vitro. Instead, lnc-CRCMSL silencing accelerates CRC cell proliferation and migration. RNA-pulldown assay identifies high mobility group box 2 (HMGB2) as a downstream protein of lnc-CRCMSL. Mechanically, lnc-CRCMSL physically binds to HMGB2 and stabilizes the localization of HMGB2 in the cytoplasm. Notably, lnc-CRCMSL knockdown lead to the shift of HMGB2 into nuclear, in which it triggers epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) programming. Importantly, lnc-CRCMSL controls the cytoplasmic retention of HMGB2 and attenuates the interaction between HMGB2 and OCT4 to suppress EMT. Treatment of leptomycin B (LMB), a potent and specific nuclear export inhibitor, counteracts lnc-CRCMSL-mediated suppression of aggressive phenotypes and EMT process by accumulating the nuclear HMGB2. CONCLUSION: Our data highlight the anti-metastatic role of lnc-CRCMSL in stabilizing HMGB2 through lncRNA-protein interactions in the cytoplasm, and suggest that targeting lnc-CRCMSL may represent a therapeutic opportunity for managing metastatic CRC.",Oncogene,2019,"['Han Q', 'Xu L', 'Lin W', 'Yao X', 'Jiang M', 'Zhou R', 'Sun X', 'Zhao L']",

As TGF-β/Smad signaling is considered to play a key role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), we attempted to clarify the mechanism underlying LRG-related EMT in relation to metastasis in PDAC. We cultured LRG-overexpressing PDAC cells (Panc1/LRG) and evaluated the morphology, EMT-related molecules and TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway in these cells. We also assessed the LRG levels in plasma and resected specimens from patients with PDAC. Inflammatory cytokines induced LRG production in PDAC cells. A spindle-like shape was visualized more frequently than other shapes in Panc1/LRG with TGF-β1 exposure. The expression of E-cadherin in Panc1/LRG was decreased with TGF-β1 exposure. Invasion increased with TGF-β1 stimulation of Panc1/LRG. The phosphorylation of smad2 in Panc1/LRG was increased in comparison with parental Panc1 under TGF-β1 stimulation. In the plasma LRG-high group, the recurrence rate tended to be higher and the recurrence-free survival (RFS) tended to be worse in comparison with the plasma LRG-low group.

The prognosis of patients with ESCC is dismal with a 5-year survival of about 15%. Thus, identification of novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for ESCC patients is urgently needed. Here, we found that manipulation of I-branching N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GCNT2) expression had no effect on cell proliferation. Notably, overexpression of GCNT2 promoted the migration and invasion, and this effect was associated with increased expression of N-cadherin and vimentin and decreased expression of E-cadherin in KYSE30 and EC9706 cells. Knockdown of GCNT2 decreased the expression of N-cadherin and vimentin, increased the expression of E-cadherin, and inhibited the migration and invasion in KYSE150 and EC109 cells. The expression of GCNT2 was significantly higher in tumour tissues than in paratumour tissues through tissue microarray analysis. More importantly, overall survival was significantly lower in patients with high GCNT2 expression than those with low GCNT2 expression. Collectively, our findings establish GCNT2 as a novel regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and a candidate prognostic indicator of outcome in ESCC patients. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Our study suggested that GCNT2 was highly expressed in patients with ESCC and predicted adverse outcome.

In this study, we aimed to identify novel markers for CRC.
METHODS: We performed exome analysis of sporadic colorectal cancer (sCRC) coding regions to screen loss of function (LoF) mutation genes, and carried out systems-level approaches to confirm top rank gene in this study.
RESULTS: We identified loss of BMP5 is an early event in CRC. Deep sequencing identified BMP5 was mutated in 7.7% (8/104) of sCRC samples, with 37.5% truncating mutation frequency. Notably, BMP5 negative expression and its prognostic value is uniquely significant in sCRC but not in other tumor types. Furthermore, BMP5 expression was positively correlated with E-cadherin in CRC patients and its dysregulation play a vital role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), thus triggering tumor initiation and development.

30570852,MicroRNA-372-3p promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in breast carcinoma by activating the Wnt pathway.,"PURPOSE: To explore the role of microRNA (miR)-372-3p in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of breast carcinoma and its potential mechanism.
METHODS: The expression of miR-372-3p was detected by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) in 48 samples of breast carcinoma tissues, 30 samples of normal breast tissues, normal breast cells (MCF-10A) and breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and HCC38). Transfection efficacy of miR-372-3p mimic and miR-372-3p inhibitor was determined by RT-PCR. Cell viability and invasion were determined by CCK-8 assay and wound healing assay, respectively. The interaction between miR-372-3p and DDK1 was verified by the luciferase reporter assay. Expression levels of DDK1, Wnt3a, E-cadherin and N-cadherin in breast carcinoma cells transfected with miR-372-3p mimic, miR-372-3p inhibitor and DKK1 were detected by Western blot.
RESULTS: The expression of miR-372-3p in breast carcinoma tissues was higher than that of normal breast tissues. Correlation analysis revealed that the miR-372-3p expression was negatively correlated with the postoperative survival, but positively correlated with the tumor size and stage of patients with breast carcinoma. No significant correlation was observed between the miR-372-3p expression and age, gender or lymph node metastasis. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve indicated a high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for miR-372-3p. CCK-8 assay and wound healing assay illustrated that miR-372-3p increased the viability and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and HCC38 cells, respectively. Luciferase activity assay suggested that miR-372-3p was specifically bound to the 3'UTR of DKK1. Overexpressed miR-372-3p markedly increased the expressions of Wnt3a and N-cadherin, but decreased the expressions of DKK1 and E-cadherin, which were reversed by miR-372-3p knockdown. The protein expressions of E-cadherin and N-cadherin were remarkably increased in cells co-transfected with miR-372-3p mimic and DKK1 in comparison with those transfected with miR-372-3p mimic only.
CONCLUSIONS: MiR-372-3p is upregulated in breast carcinoma tissues, which promotes the viability and invasion of breast carcinoma cells through the Wnt pathway.",J BUON,2018,"['Fan X', 'Huang X', 'Li Z', 'Ma X']",
30570110,High PLK4 expression promotes tumor progression and induces epithelial‑mesenchymal transition by regulating the Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway in colorectal cancer.,"Polo‑like kinase 4 (PLK4) has been identified as an oncogene, which is overexpressed in various types of human cancer; however, its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) development remains unknown. The present study demonstrated that PLK4 protein expression was upregulated in CRC tissues compared with in normal tissues through western blotting. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis of 39 CRC specimens further demonstrated that PLK4 protein expression was upregulated in 64.1% (25/39) of samples. Increased PLK4 expression was closely associated with enhanced tumor size (P=0.031), lymph node metastasis (P=0.016) and TNM stage (P=0.001). Subsequently, cell viability, wound scratch, migration and invasion assays were conducted in vitro, and nude mice CRC xenograft models were generated. The results demonstrated that knockdown of PLK4 in CRC cells resulted in significant decreases in cell viability and proliferation, and decreased the protein expression levels of N‑cadherin and snail, which are biomarkers of epithelial‑mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, PLK4 knockdown inactivated the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway in CRC cells in vitro and in vivo, and suppressed the growth of xenograft tumors in nude mice. In conclusion, these results suggested that PLK4 may promote the carcinogenesis and metastasis of CRC, thus indicating that PLK4 may be considered a molecular target for CRC treatment.",Int. J.

30569446,"Biomarkers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in localized, surgically treated clear-cell renal cell carcinoma.","INTRODUCTION: It has been suggested that the metastatic potential of neoplastic cells can be predicted on the basis of their biological features, including expression of proteins involved in the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Therefore, the purpose of this work was to (1) evaluate the expression of EMT markers: ZEB2, vimentin, N-cadherin, TWIST, PTEN, survivin, E-cadherin, Ki-67 and GLUT-1, (2) assess mutation status of two genes: PIK3CA and KRAS, and (3) investigate the potential relationships between the studied biomarkers and clinicopathological factors in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Tumor tissue samples (embedded in paraffin blocks) from 159 patients undergoing radical nephrectomy were analyzed. Proteins expression was evaluated immunohistochemically. DNA mutations were analyzed on DNA isolated from tumor tissue and amplified by real-time PCR detection using suitable fluorescent labeled TaqMan assays.
RESULTS: One hundred and seven men and 52 women of mean age of 63.1years were enrolled. Fifty four cancers at pTNM stage I-II and 98 at pTNM III-IV stage were diagnosed. There were 30 Fuhrman grade G1, 61 Fuhrman G2, 49 Fuhrman G3 and 19 Fuhrman G4 tumors. A negative correlation between ZEB2 (p = 0.047, r = -0.172) or E-cadherin expression (p = 0.027, r = -0.191) and TNM was observed. Positive association between grade and Ki-67 (p < 0.001), survivin (p < 0.001), vimentin (p < 0.001) immunoreactivity and negative association between TWIST expression (p = 0.029) or PTEN expression (p = 0.013) were found. Ki-67 expression was positively correlated with survivin (p < 0.001, r = 0.617), vimentin (p = 0.001, r = 0.251) and N-cadherin (p = 0,009, r = 0.207) immunoreactivity which can suggest tumor aggressiveness. TWIST was negatively correlated with E-cadherin (p < 0.001, r = -0.284), vimentin (p < 0.001, r = -0.297) and N-cadherin (p < 0.002, r = -0.241). ZEB2 was not associated with ccRCC grade but was negatively correlated with E-cadherin (p = 0.055, r= -0.153) and PTEN (p = 0.006). GLUT-1 expression was inversely linked to E-cadherin expression (p = 0.022, r= -0.182). Mutations in PIK3CA and KRAS genes were not found in any of the studied ccRCC tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: Low-grade tumors showed higher expression of ZEB2 and TWIST proteins than high-grade tumors, which can suggest that EMT in ccRCC begins at early stages of tumor development and, therefore, evaluation of these proteins, together with other biomarkers, may be useful for assessment of the tumor metastatic potential.",Folia Histochem.

The expression of miR‑495 in 122 pairs of NSCLC tissues and matched paracarcinoma tissues, as well as in human lung cancer cell lines (A549, H460, H1650, H520 and SK‑MES‑1) and the normal human pulmonary bronchial epithelial cell line 16HBE was determined using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR). As predicted by bioinformatics analysis, high mobility group A2 (HMGA2) may be a potential target gene of miR‑495. In addition, the regulatory function of miR‑495 on its target gene HMGA2 was evaluated using a dual‑luciferase reporter assay, RT‑qPCR and western blotting. Furthermore, the effect of miR‑495 on the proliferation of A549 lung cancer cells was investigated using a Cell Counting Kit‑8 (CCK‑8) assay. The results demonstrated that the expression of miR‑495 in NSCLC tissues and cells was significantly downregulated compared with the control. In addition, downregulated expression of miR‑495 was associated with tumor differentiation, lymph node metastasis and tumor, node and metastasis staging. Additionally, a dual‑luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR‑495 could directly associated with the 3'‑untranslated region of HMGA2. Upregulated expression of miR‑495 significantly downregulated the mRNA and protein expression levels of HMGA2 in A549 cells. Furthermore, the results of CCK‑8 assay revealed that upregulated expression of miR‑495 significantly suppressed the proliferation of A549 cells; HMGA2 overexpression reversed this inhibition.

Several reports have shown that USP11 plays an important role in cancer development. Previous research has shown that USP11 is upregulated in breast cancer, but the function of USP11 in ovarian cancer has not been determined to date. In the present study, we observed that USP11 was upregulated in ovarian cancer tissues and cell lines. To determine the role of USP11 in ovarian cancer, we performed several functional experiments, including Transwell migration and invasion analysis, in vitro and in vivo deubiquitination assays, colony formation assays, and CCK‑8 assays. Notably, we observed that USP11 facilitated the epithelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is an important process in cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, we observed that USP11 regulated EMT through the regulation of Snail. Our results revealed that USP11 promoted EMT in ovarian cancer by deubiquitinating Snail, and USP11 may be a novel therapeutic target for ovarian cancer treatment.",Oncol.

30569142,Hsp70 (HSP70A1A) downregulation enhances the metastatic ability of cancer cells.,"Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70; also known as HSP70A1A) is one of the most induced proteins in cancer cells; however, its role in cancer has not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we proposed a hypothetical model in which the silencing of Hsp70 enhanced the metastatic properties of the HeLa, A549 and MCF7 cancer cell lines. We consider that the inability of cells to form cadherin‑catenin complexes in the absence of Hsp70 stimulates their detachment from neighboring cells, which is the first step of anoikis and metastasis. Under these conditions, an epithelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway is activated that causes cancer cells to acquire a mesenchymal phenotype, which is known to possess a higher ability for migration. Therefore, we herein provide evidence of the dual role of Hsp70 which, according to international literature, first establishes a cancerous environment and then, as suggested by our team, regulates the steps of the metastatic process, including EMT and migration. Finally, the trigger for the anti‑metastatic properties that are acquired by cancer cells in the absence of Hsp70 appears to be the destruction of the Hsp70‑dependent heterocomplexes of E‑cadherin/catenins, which function like an anchor between neighboring cells.",Int.

The formation of spheroid cells, and the results of reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses showed that metformin suppressed the ability to form spheroid cells and the expression of stemness markers in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. Additionally, metformin attenuated the EMT process, characterized by a decrease of mesenchymal marker Vimentin and an increase in the expression of an epithelial marker. Mechanistically, metformin inactivated the Wnt3a/β‑catenin signaling pathway, and reactivation of Wnt3a/β‑catenin signaling attenuated the inhibition of metformin on the stemness of HCT116 colorectal cancer cells and EMT. Finally, it was revealed that metformin re‑sensitized HCT116 sphere cells to 5‑fluorouracil resistance. These results suggest that metformin can attenuate stemness and EMT in colorectal cancer cells.",Mol Med Rep,2019,"['Zhang C', 'Wang Y']",
30569128,The role of ZBTB38 in promoting migration and invasive growth of bladder cancer cells.,"Bladder cancer is the most common malignancy of the urinary tract, and ~50% of patients with bladder cancer experience recurrence and metastasis. The results of mass spectrometry revealed that the expression of zinc finger and BTB domain‑containing 38 (ZBTB38) was higher in highly aggressive human bladder cancer 253J B‑V cells compared with in the less aggressive bladder cancer 253J cells. However, the association between ZBTB38 and bladder cancer is currently not well defined, and the association of ZBTB38 with migration and invasive growth of bladder cancer cells remains unclear. Previous studies have suggested that ZBTB38 may act as an oncogene, similar to Kaiso. Furthermore, analysis of a clinical database suggested that ZBTB38 expression may be associated with poor prognosis of patients with bladder cancer. Using cell proliferation, migration and invasion assays, and western blotting, the present study demonstrated that ZBTB38 promoted the migration and invasive growth of bladder cancer cells, but inhibited their proliferation. Further experiments suggested that ZBTB38 promoted epithelial‑mesenchymal transition and the expression levels of genes downstream of the Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway. Notably, further experiments using a xenograft tumor metastasis model revealed that ZBTB38 promoted bladder cancer lung metastasis in vivo. These findings suggested that ZBTB38 promoted migration and invasive growth of bladder cancer cells through facilitation of the Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal that ZBTB38 may promote migration and invasive growth of bladder cancer cells via modulation of the Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway.",Oncol.

One of the major virulence factors in H. pylori is the cytotoxin‑associated gene A (CagA). With the growing proportion of amoxicillin‑resistant H. pylori strains, the present study aimed to explore the effects of CagA‑ and penicillin‑binding protein 1A (PBP1A) mutation‑positive H. pylori (H. pyloriCagA+/P+) on GC cells, and its clinical significance. The clinical significance of H. pyloriCagA+/P+ infection was analyzed in patients with GC. In vitro, GC cells were infected with H. pyloriCagA+/P+ to investigate whether it was involved in the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) of SGC‑7901 cells using immunofluorescence and western blot analysis. The results of clinical analysis demonstrated that, although CagA‑negative H. pylori infection had no significant association with the characteristics of patients with GC, H. pyloriCagA+/P+ infection was significantly associated with various clinicopathological parameters, including invasion depth, lymphatic metastasis and distant metastasis. In vitro, the results indicated that H. pyloriCagA+/P+ promoted proliferation, invasion and EMT of SGC‑7901 cells. MicroRNA (miR)‑134 was downregulated in H. pyloriCagA+/P+ infected tissues compared with in those with H. pyloriCagA+/P‑ infection. miR‑134 overexpression significantly reversed H. pyloriCagA+/P+ infection‑associated cell proliferation, invasion and EMT. Furthermore, the results revealed that Forkhead box protein M1 (FoxM1) was a direct target of miR‑134, and FoxM1 knockdown impeded H. pyloriCagA+/P+‑induced EMT. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that miR‑134 may suppress the proliferation, invasion and EMT of SGC‑7901 cells by targeting FoxM1, and may serve a protective role in the process of H. pyloriCagA+/P+‑induced GC. These findings may lead to an improved understanding of H. pyloriCagA+/P+‑associated poor clinical characteristics in patients with GC.",Int. J. Oncol.,2019,"['Huang L', 'Wang ZY', 'Pan DD']",
30569117,PTEN downregulates WD repeat‑containing protein 66 in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma.,"Salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC) is one of the most common types of salivary gland cancer that causes substantial morbidity and mortality. Despite the substantial health burden of SACC, the molecular mechanisms underlying its development and progression remain poorly understood. We previously reported the loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression to be common among SACC tumors, and the PTEN deficiency to be correlated with enrichment of epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes based on expression array analysis. The aim of the present study was to investigate further the functional function of WD repeat‑containing protein 66 (WDR66), one of the enriched EMT genes, in the context of PTEN deficiency and SACC pathogenesis. WDR66 was identified to be required to maintain the EMT phenotype and the expression of cancer stem cell genes in the context of PTEN deficiency. Furthermore, knockdown of WDR66 decreased cellular proliferation, migration and invasion. Finally, WDR66 expression was identified to be inversely associated with PTEN expression and negatively correlated with the overall survival of patients with SACC. Collectively, the results of the present study revealed a novel function of WDR66 in mediating the progression of PTEN‑deficient SACCs, thereby suggesting WDR66 inhibition to be a potential therapeutic approach towards successful management of SACC disease progression, particularly against tumors with decreased PTEN expression levels.",Oncol.

The present study revealed that ERp29 was important to ERS and interfered with the malignant behaviors of colorectal cancer (CRC). Experiments in in vitro and in animal models revealed that ERS inhibited the cell growth and suppressed the metastatic capacity of CRC cells, but ERp29 counteracted these effects. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that ERp29 recovered the migration and metastatic behaviors of CRC cells suppressed by ERS, mediated only when it combined with cullin5 (CUL5). ERp29 also relied on CUL5 to promote epithelial‑mesenchymal transition. From the immunohistochemical examination of CRC tissues, the high expression of ERp29 was revealed to predict the poor prognosis of 457 CRC cases. The retrospective analysis of the clinicopathological data of patients with CRC was consistent with the results of the in vitro and in vivo experiments.

Trichosanthin is a promising agent for the treatment of cervical cancer. However, the exact effects and potential mechanism of TCS on cervical cancer are not well known.
METHOD: The cell viability of TCS on cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa and caski cells) were detected by a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Cell proliferation was measured by Ki-67 staining and cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. Cell migration and invasion were detected by wound assay and transwell assay, respectively. The levels of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Snail, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, p-STAT5, STAT5, p-C-myc, C-myc were detected by western blot.
RESULTS: The present study showed that TCS inhibited the proliferation of HeLa and caski cells and reduced Ki-67 and P-C-myc expression. In addition, flow cytometric analysis showed that TCS induced the apoptosis of HeLa and caski cells. The potent effect of TCS on cell apoptosis as determined by the increase the levels of caspase-3 and decrease the levels of Bcl-2. TCS also inhibited cervical cancer cell invasion, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Furthermore, TCS treatment markedly inhibited the activation of STAT5/C-myc signaling pathway.

The aim of the current study was to investigate the ability of microRNA-150 (miR-150) targeting transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4) to mediate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion, and metastasis through the β-catenin signaling pathway in PCa. Microarray analysis was performed to identify PCa-related differentially expressed genes, after which both the mirDIP and TargetScan databases were employed in the prediction of the miRNAs regulating TRPM4. Immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR were conducted to determine the expression pattern of miR-150 and TRPM4 in PCa. The relationship between miR-150 and TRPM4 expression was identified. By perturbing miR-150 and TRPM4 expression in PCa cells, cell proliferation, migration, invasion, cycle, and apoptosis as well as EMT markers were determined accordingly. Finally, tumor growth and metastasis were evaluated among nude mice. Higher TRPM4 expression and lower miR-150 expression and activation of the β-catenin signaling pathway as well as EMT stimulation were detected in the PCa tissues. Our results confirmed TRPM4 as a target of miR-150. Upregulation of miR-150 resulted in inactivation of the β-catenin signaling pathway. Furthermore, the upregulation of miR-150 or knockdown of TRPM4 was observed to suppress EMT, proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro in addition to restrained tumor growth and metastasis in vivo.

The purpose of the present study is to investigate the expression profile and functional role of microRNA-625 (miR-625) in LSCC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: LSCC tissues and adjacent normal tissues were collected from 86 LSCC patients. The expression levels of miR-625 and SOX4 mRNA in tissues and cells were detected by RT-qPCR analysis. The expression levels of SOX4 and EMT-related proteins were detected by western blot analysis. 
RESULTS: The results demonstrated that miR-625 is significantly down-regulated in clinical LSCC tissues, and its low expression may be closely associated with unfavorable clinicopathological characteristics of LSCC patients. Overexpression of miR-625 significantly suppressed the proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT of LSCC cells. Furthermore, SOX4 was validated as a direct target of miR-625 in LSCC cells, and rescue experiments suggested that restoration of SOX4 blocked the tumor suppressive role of miR-625 in LSCC cells.

30562757,High Expressions of CUL4A and TP53 in Colorectal Cancer Predict Poor Survival.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Cullin 4A (CUL4A) is vital in cell survival, development, growth and cell cycle, it plays an important role in chaperone-mediated ubiquitination and interacts with TP53 in carcinogenesis. However, the clinicopathologic significance of CUL4A expression in colorectal cancer is unknown; in particular, the prognostic value of CUL4A combined with TP53 expression has not been explored.
METHODS: We analyzed the expression of CUL4A in both public database (Oncomine) and 180 cases of colorectal cancer and paired normal tissues by real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Colony formation, wound healing, migration and invasion assays and tumorigenesis in nude mice were used to explore the function of CUL4A in CRC proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Markers of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) were evaluated by western blotting. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to analyse the relationship between CUL4A expression and E-cadherin expression.
RESULTS: CUL4A and TP53 protein expression was significantly higher in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. Significant correlation between CUL4A and TP53 expression was observed. CUL4A expression was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Interestingly, patients with tumors that had both CUL4A overexpression and mutant TP53 protein accumulation relapsed and died within a significantly short period after surgery (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that patients with both CUL4A+ and TP53+ positive tumors had extremely poor OS and DFS. Knockdown of CUL4A by a short interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly suppressed the progression of EMT, proliferation, migration, and invasion of colon cancer cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. ZEB1 silencing blocked CUL4A-driven these processes.

Bioinformatics studies have demonstrated the abnormal expression of CCDC43 gene in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the role and molecular mechanism of CCDC43 in CRC remain unknown.
METHODS: The functional role of CCDC43 and FOXK1 in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was determined using immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, western blot, EdU incorporation, luciferase, chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and cell invasion assays.
RESULTS: The CCDC43 gene was overexpressed in human CRC. High expression of CCDC43 protein was associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in patients with CRC. Moreover, the induction of EMT by CCDC43 occurred through TGF-β signaling. Furthermore, a positive correlation between the expression patterns of CCDC43 and FOXK1 was observed in CRC cells. Promoter assays demonstrated that FOXK1 directly bound and activated the human CCDC43 gene promoter. In addition, CCDC43 was necessary for FOXK1- mediated EMT and metastasis in vitro and vivo.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Human ESCC tissues and cancer-adjacent normal tissues were collected. The mRNA expression level of miR-490-3p was detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). On-line target gene prediction software was applied to screen high-mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2). Subsequently, MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide), qRT-PCR, Western blotting, transwell and scratch-wound assays were conducted to analyze the effect of miR-490-3p on the biological function of the ESCC cell line (EC-109).
RESULTS: In our study, the mRNA expression level of miR-490-3p was remarkably reduced in ESCC tissues and cells. Molecular mechanism analysis confirmed that miR-490-3p could act on the 3'-UTR of HMGA2 and regulate its expression. Subsequent functional experiments indicated that decreased expression of HMGA2 resulting from the up-regulation of miR-490-3p could inhibit the proliferation, invasion, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of ESCC cells.

30556869,Long non-coding RNA LINC00675 inhibits tumorigenesis and EMT via repressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,"OBJECTIVE: Long noncoding RNA LINC00675 (LINC00675) seems to play an anti-oncogenic role in cancers, though its exact function remains unknown. Up to date, little is known about the role of LINC00675 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). In this study, we aimed to explore the expression pattern, clinical significance and biological function of LINC00675 in ESCC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: RT-PCR was performed to detect the expression levels of LINC00675 in both ESCC tissue and cell lines. The association of LINC00675 expression with clinicopathological factors and prognosis was statistically analyzed. Cell growth was detected by MTT assay and colony formation assay. Cell apoptosis was evaluated with flow cytometry. Migration and invasion ability of ESCC cells were detected wound healing assay and transwell assays. The expressions of EMT-related proteins and Wnt/β-catenin-related proteins by Western blot were investigated.
RESULTS: LINC00675 expression was significantly downregulated in both ESCC tissues and cell lines. Decreased LINC00675 expression was correlated with histological grade, lymph nodes metastasis and advanced clinical stage. Furthermore, LINC00675 could serve as an independent predictor for overall survival in ESCC. Importantly, in vitro experiments indicated that that forced LINC00675 expression significantly suppressed inhibited ESCC cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion and EMT, and promoted cell apoptosis through suppressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: We suggested that LINC00675 acted as a tumor suppressor in ESCC via regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and may be a new prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for ESCC intervention.",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,2018,"['Zhong YB', 'Shan AJ', 'Lv W', 'Wang J', 'Xu JZ']",
30556864,Circ_0009910 regulates growth and metastasis and is associated with poor prognosis in gastric cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have recently shown capabilities as gene regulators in mammals. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects and mechanism of circ_0009910 in gastric cancer (GC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Circ_0009910 expression was quantified by Real-time PCR in human GC cell lines and tissues. Association between circ_0009910 levels and clinicopathological factors and patient's prognosis was analyzed. The roles of circ_0009910 in regulating GC cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion were evaluated in vitro. Western blot analysis was conducted to detect the expressions of molecular markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
RESULTS: Circ_0009910 expression level was elevated in GC tissues and cell lines and associated with clinical stage (p = 0.032), distant metastasis (p = 0.028) and differentiation (p = 0.007). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that circ_0009910 expression in positive group has a worse overall survival compared to the negative group (p = 0.0013). Multivariate analysis showed that circ_0009910 was an independent risk factor for GC (HR = 2.346, 95% CI: 1.673-3.775, p = 0.006). Knockdown of circ_0009910 expression can suppress BGC823 and AGS cells proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro experiments. The results of Western blot indicated that knockdown of circ_0009910 increased expression of E-cadherin and decreased expression of the mesenchymal markers, snail and N-cadherin.
CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, we demonstrate that circ_0009910 acts as a prognostic biomarker and promote cell proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT in GC, indicating that circ_0009910 may be a novel potential biomarker and therapeutic target of GC.",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,2018,"['Liu M', 'Liu KD', 'Zhang L', 'Cai J', 'Yao HW', 'Bai YK', 'Zhang ZT']",
30556860,Twist1/2 activates MMP2 expression via binding to its promoter in colorectal cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to characterize the effect of Twist2 on epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the invasive potential of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells and to explore the mechanisms underlying the regulative effect of Twist1 and Twist2 on matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) expression in CRC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data mining was performed in colorectal cancer cohort (COADREAD) in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-COADREAD). CRC LoVo and HCT116 cells were used as in vitro cell models.
RESULTS: CRC tumors with lymphatic invasion (N = 102) had a significantly higher expression of TWIST1 (p = 0.01) and TWIST2 (p = 0.02) than the lymphatic invasion negative cases (N = 228). TWIST2 overexpression enhanced EMT and the invasive potential of the CRC LoVo and HCT116 cells, while TWIST2 knockdown reversed the EMT process and weakened the invasive potential of the cells. TWIST1 and TWIST2 were co-upregulated with MMP2 and MMP9 in COADREAD cohort. TWIST1 or TWIST2 overexpression significantly elevated nuclear β-catenin accumulation, which is a known signaling pathway elevating MMP2 and MMP9 expression. More importantly, we found that both Twist1 and Twist2 could transcriptionally activate MMP2 via directly binding to its promoter. However, this mechanism was not observed in the MMP9 promoter.
CONCLUSIONS: TWIST1/2 is associated with lymphatic invasion in CRC. TWIST2 upregulation enhances EMT and the invasive potential of CRC cells. TWIST1/2 can enhance the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in CRC cells. In addition, Twist1/2 can bind to the MMP2 promoter and promote its transcription.",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,2018,"['Lu K', 'Dong JL', 'Fan WJ']",
30556856,IL-37 suppresses migration and invasion of gallbladder cancer cells through inhibition of HIF-1α induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition.,"OBJECTIVE: Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is the seventh most common cancer across the globe and the most common malignancy of the biliary tract. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important pre-requisite for tumor metastasis; however, its mechanism in GBC has not yet been defined. In the present study, we investigated the effects of interleukin-37 (IL-37) on the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of gallbladder cancer cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: RT-qPCR and Western blotting were used to determine the expression of IL-37 in GBC cancer cells and non-tumorigenic human intra-hepatic biliary epithelial cell line. Western blotting was also used for detecting the expression of vimentin, Snail, and E-cadherin.
RESULTS: Expression level of IL-37 in GBC cells was decreased in GBC cancer cells compared with the non-tumorigenic human intra-hepatic biliary epithelial cell line. Decreased expression of vimentin and Snail and increased expression of E-cadherin were found in the groups which overexpress IL-37 when compared with the control. Mechanism study showed that IL-37 suppressed the expression of HIF1α in cells. However, HIF1α stabilization by CoCl2 could attenuate the function of IL-37.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that IL-37 plays an antitumor role during the progression of gallbladder carcinoma. IL-37 could inhibit HIF1α induced EMT. Our data provide a new strategy for the treatment of gallbladder cancer.",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,2018,"['Wu TJ', 'Xu B', 'Zhao GH', 'Luo J', 'Luo C']",
30556279,FAM134B induces tumorigenesis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition via Akt signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Fam134b (JK-1, RETREG1) was first identified as an oncogene in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. However, the roles of FAM134B during tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were previously unclear. In this study, we investigated the function of FAM134B in HCC and the related tumorigenesis mechanisms, as well as how FAM134B induces EMT. We detected the expression of FAM134B in a normal hepatic cell line, HCC cell lines, fresh specimens, and a HCC tissue microarray. A retrospective study of 122 paired HCC tissue microarrays was used to analyze the correlation between FAM134B and clinical features. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments, rescue experiments, Akt pathway activator/inhibitors, nude mice xenograft models, and nude mice lung metastasis models were used to determine the underlying mechanisms of FAM134B in inducing tumorigenesis and EMT in vitro and in vivo. The expression level of FAM134B was highly elevated in HCC, as compared with that in normal liver tissues and normal hepatic cells. Overexpression of FAM134B was significantly associated with tumor size (P = 0.025), pathological vascular invasion (P = 0.026), differentiation grade (P = 0.023), cancer recurrence (P = 0.044), and portal vein tumor thrombus (P = 0.036) in HCC. Patients with high expression of FAM134B had shorter overall survival and disease-free survival than patients with non-high expression of FAM134B. Furthermore, knockdown of FAM134B with shRNAs inhibited cell growth and motility, as well as tumor formation and metastasis in nude mice, all of which were promoted by overexpression of FAM134B. Our study demonstrated that Fam134b is an oncogene that plays a crucial role in HCC via the Akt signaling pathway with subsequent glycogen synthase kinase-3β phosphorylation, accumulation of β-catenin, and stabilization of Snail, which promotes tumorigenesis, EMT, and tumor metastasis in HCC.",Mol Oncol,2019,"['Zhang ZQ', 'Chen J', 'Huang WQ', 'Ning D', 'Liu QM', 'Wang C', 'Zhang L', 'Ren L', 'Chu L', 'Liang HF', 'Fan HN', 'Zhang BX', 'Chen XP']",

In this study, we explored the mechanism and function of lncRNA HCP5 in osteosarcoma (OS). At first, five lncRNAs were chosen from GeneCard and subjected to qRT-PCR examination. The results indicated that HCP5 was significantly overexpressed in four OS cell lines. Northern blot assay further proved the higher expression of HCP5 in OS cell lines. To identify the biological role of HCP5 in OS, we silenced the expression of HCP5 in U2OS and MG-63 cells which possessed the highest level of HCP5. CCK-8 and colony formation assay revealed the inhibitory effect of HCP5 knockdown on cell proliferation. Cell apoptosis was found to be increased in cells transfected with sh-HCP5#1. Moreover, cell invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were reversed by the silencing of HCP5. The results of functional assays showed that HCP5 acted as an oncogene in osteosarcoma. Mechanically, HCP5 was found to be activated by the transcription factor SP1. Finally, rescue assays were conducted to demonstrate the function of SP1/HCP5 axis in osteosarcoma. In conclusion, we confirmed that SP1-induced upregulation of long non-coding RNA HCP5 promotes the development of osteosarcoma.",Pathol. Res. Pract.,2019,"['Zhao W', 'Li L']",

This study aimed to investigate the effects of the MYH10 gene on normal human glial cells and glioma cell lines in vitro, by gene silencing, and to determine the signaling pathways involved. MATERIAL AND METHODS The normal human glial cell line HEB, and the glioma cell lines, U251, T98G, and SHG44 were studied. Plasmid transfection silenced the MYH10 gene. The cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay evaluated cell viability. Cell migration and invasion were evaluated using scratch and transwell assays. Western blot measured the protein expression levels, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the mRNA expression levels, for MYH10, metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA-1), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP2), collagen 1, E-cadherin, vimentin, Wnt3a, β-catenin, and cyclin D1. RESULTS The MYH10 gene was overexpressed in U251, T98G, and SHG44 cells. MYH10 expression was down-regulated following siMYH10 plasmid interference, which also inhibited glioma cell migration and invasion. MYH10 gene silencing resulted in reduced expression of MTA-1, MPP-2, MMP-9 and vimentin, and increased expression of TIMP-2, E-cadherin and collagen 1 at the protein and mRNA level, and inhibited the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. CONCLUSIONS In human glioma cell lines, silencing the MYH10 gene reduced cell migration and invasion, by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which may regulate the ECM and inhibit EMT in human glioma.",Med.

30551873,Circular RNA circMTO1 suppresses bladder cancer metastasis by sponging miR-221 and inhibiting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.,"Bladder cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related death because of its distant metastasis and high recurrence rates. Deregulation of circular RNAs (circRNAs) can act either as tumor suppressors or oncogenes to control cell proliferation, migration, and metastasis. The role of circMTO1 in bladder cancer remain unknown. In this study, we investigated whether circMTO1 could use as a biomarker and therapeutic target for bladder cancer treatment. We first demonstrated that circMTO1 was an important circRNA frequently downregulated in bladder cancer tissue, and lower circMTO1 levels were positively correlated with bladder cancer patients' metastasis and poorer survival. Ectopic expression of circMTO1 in bladder cancer cells inhibited cell's epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis. In addition, we also revealed that circMTO1 was able to sponge miR-221 and overexpression of circMTO1 negatively regulated the E-cadherin/N-cadherin pathway to inhibit bladder cancer cells' EMT by competing for miR-221. In conclusion, our findings provide comprehensive evidences that circMTO1 is a prognostic biomarker in bladder cancer and suggest that circMTO1 may function as a novel therapeutic target in human bladder cancer.",Biochem.

30551480,Long non-coding RNA XIST promotes the development of esophageal cancer by sponging miR-494 to regulate CDK6 expression.,"OBJECTIVE: Esophageal cancer is one of the deadliest cancers worldwide occurring at upper gastrointestinal tract. This study aimed to explore the possible role of long non-coding RNA X Inactive Specific Transcript (XIST) in the development of esophageal cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The lncRNA XIST expressions both in esophageal cancer tissues and in cells were investigated. The TE-1 and SKGT-4 cells were transfected with LV-sh-XIST and LV-scramble for the further detection of the effects of XIST expression on cell biological processes, including proliferation, apoptosis and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, migration, invasion and the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers. Additionally, the regulatory relationships between lncRNA XIST and miR-494, between miR-494 and CDK6, between miR-494/CDK6 and JAK2/STAT3 pathway were investigated.
RESULTS: LncRNA XIST was overespressed in esophageal cancer tissues and cells. Suppression of XIST significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion, but induced apoptosis of two kinds of cells, TE-1 and SKGT-4. Moreover, miR-494 was down-regulated in esophageal cancer tissues and cells. XIST could sponge miR-494 and inhibition of miR-494 reversed the effects of XIST suppression on the malignant behaviors of TE-1 cells. Also, CDK6 was a target of miR-494 and CDK6 knockdown reversed the effects of miR-494 inhibition on the malignant behaviors of TE-1 cells. Besides, the expression of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 was increased after miR-494 inhibition, which was reversed after inhibition of miR-494 and CDK6 at the same time.
CONCLUSIONS: The data presented in this study revealed that XIST abnormal expression may play an oncogenic role in the development of esophageal cancer via miR-494/CDK6 axis through JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway.

30551470,Downregulation of miR-139-5p promotes prostate cancer progression through regulation of SOX5.,"Altered expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) was involved in prostate cancer progression. However, how miRNAs contributed to prostate cancer development remained unknown. Here, we reported that miR-139-5p levels were decreased in prostate cancer tumor tissues and prostate cancer cell lines. Transfection of miR-139-5p mimics reduced cell proliferation and migration ability of prostate cancer cells. Western blotting and RT-qPCR showed that elevation of miR-139-5p greatly inhibited SOX5 expression in prostate cancer cells. Through regulation of SOX5, enhanced expression of miR-139-5p downregulated TWIST, decreased N-cadherin and Vimentin expression, suggesting inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. The dual luciferase assay validated that SOX5 was a direct target of miR-139-5p. Additionally, a significant negative correlation between SOX5 mRNA levels and miR-139-5p levels were detected in prostate cancer tumor tissues. Our study indicated that miR-139-5p functioned as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer cells by regulation of SOX5, and it might be a promising target for prostate cancer patients.",Biomed.

30548372,The FZD7-TWIST1 axis is responsible for anoikis resistance and tumorigenesis in ovarian carcinoma.,"Frizzled family receptor 7 (FZD7), a Wnt signaling receptor, is associated with the maintenance of stem cell properties and cancer progression. FZD7 has emerged as a potential therapeutic target because it is capable of transducing both canonical and noncanonical Wnt signals. In this study, we investigated the regulatory pathway downstream of FZD7 and its functional roles. We found that FZD7 expression was crucial to the maintenance of the mesenchymal phenotype, anoikis resistance, and spheroid and tumor formation in ovarian cancer (OC). We identified TWIST1 as the crucial downstream effector of the FZD7 pathway. TWIST1, a basic helix loop helix transcription factor, is known to associate with mesenchymal and cancer stem cell phenotypes. Manipulating TWIST1 expression mimicked the functional consequences observed in the FZD7 model, and overexpression of TWIST1 partially rescued the functional phenotypes abolished by FZD7 knockdown. We further proved that FZD7 regulated TWIST1 expression through epigenetic modifications of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac at the TWIST1 proximal promoter. We also identified that the FZD7-TWIST1 axis regulates the expression of BCL2, a gene that controls apoptosis. Identification of this FZD7-TWIST1-BCL2 pathway reaffirms the mechanism of anoikis resistance in OC. We subsequently showed that the FZD7-TWIST1 axis can be targeted by using a small molecule inhibitor of porcupine, an enzyme essential for secretion and functional activation of Wnts. In conclusion, our results identified that the FZD7-TWIST1 axis is important for tumorigenesis and anoikis resistance, and therapeutic inhibition results in cell death in OCs.",Mol Oncol,2019,"['Tan M', 'Asad M', 'Heong V', 'Wong MK', 'Tan TZ', 'Ye J', 'Kuay KT', 'Thiery JP', 'Scott C', 'Huang RY']",
30547810,Epigenetic reprogramming of epithelial mesenchymal transition in triple negative breast cancer cells with DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibitors.,"BACKGROUND: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive neoplasia with no effective therapy. Our laboratory has developed a unique TNBC cell model presenting epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) a process known to be important for tumor progression and metastasis. There is increasing evidence showing that epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the activation of EMT. The objective of this study is to epigenetically reverse the process of EMT in TNBC by using DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi).
METHODS: We evaluated the antitumor effect of three DNMTi and six HDACi using our TNBC cell model by MTT assay, migration and invasion assay, three dimensional culture, and colony formation assay. We then performed the combined treatment both in vitro and in vivo using the most potent DNMTi and HDACi, and tested the combined treatment in a panel of breast cancer cell lines. We investigated changes of EMT markers and potential signaling pathways associated with the antitumor effects.
RESULTS: We showed that DNMTi and HDACi can reprogram highly aggressive TNBC cells that have undergone EMT to a less aggressive phenotype. SGI-110 and MS275 are superior to other seven compounds being tested. The combination of SGI with MS275 exerts a greater effect than single agent alone in inhibiting cell proliferation, motility, colony formation, and stemness of cancer cells. We also demonstrated that MS275 and the combination of SGI with MS275 exert in vivo antitumor effect. We revealed that the combined treatment synergistically reverses EMT through inhibiting EpCAM cleavage and WNT signaling, suppressing mutant p53, ZEB1, and EZH2, and inducing E-cadherin, apoptosis, as well as histone H3 tri-methylation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that DNMTi and HDACi exert antitumor activity in TNBC cells partially by epigenetically reprograming EMT. Our findings strongly suggest that TNBC is sensitive to epigenetic therapies. Therefore, we propose a new strategy to treat TNBC by using the combination of SGI-110 with MS275, which exerts superior antitumor effects by simultaneously targeting multiple pathways.",J. Exp.

Blockade of currently known targets has not yet led to successful clinical outcome. More understanding about the regulatory mechanisms in HCC is necessary for developing new effective therapeutic strategies for HCC patients.
METHODS: The expression of Rho GTPase-activating protein 11A (ARHGAP11A) was examined in human normal liver and HCC tissues. The correlations between ARHGAP11A expression and clinicopathological stage or prognosis in HCC patients were analyzed. ARHGAP11A was downregulated to determine its role in the proliferation, invasion, migration, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) development, and regulatory signaling of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: ARHGAP11A exhibited high expression in HCC, and was significantly correlated with clinicopathological stage and prognosis in HCC patients. Moreover, ARHGAP11A facilitated Hep3B and MHCC97-H cell proliferation, invasion, migration and EMT development in vitro. ARHGAP11A knockdown significantly inhibited the in vivo growth and metastasis of HCC cells. Furthermore, ARHGAP11A directly interacted with Rac1B independent of Rho GTPase- activating activity. Rac1B blockade effectively interrupted ARHGAP11A-elicited HCC malignant phenotype. Meanwhile, upregulation of Rac1B reversed ARHGAP11A knockdown mediated mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) development in HCC cells.
CONCLUSION: ARHGAP11A facilitates malignant progression in HCC patients via ARHGAP11A-Rac1B interaction. The ARHGAP11A/Rac1B signaling could be a potential therapeutic target in the clinical treatment of HCC.",Cell Commun.

30545221,Long Non-Cod-ing RNA Signature in Cervical Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer as a common urogenital cancer among women has caused significant health problems. Efforts have been made to identify its pathogenic process in order to find targeted ther-apies. Long non-cod-ing ribonucleic acids (lncRNAs) have been shown to regulate several cancer-related pathways and genes that contribute to pathogenesis of human malignancies, includ-ing cervical cancer. In the present review, we searched PubMed, Google scholar, Web of Science and Scopus databases for key words ""cervical cancer"" or ""cervical neoplasm"" and ""long non-cod-ing RNA"" or ""lncRNA"" (up to December 2017).
AIM: To elaborate the role of lncRNAs in cervical cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: LncRNAs affect cervical cancer pathogenesis through numerous mechanisms, such as mak-ing scaffolds for assembly of protein complexes, serv-ing as directors to recruit proteins, function-ing as transcriptional enhancers through chromatin remodeling, serv-ing as decoys to free up proteins from chromatin, or revers-ing the effects of other regulatory non-cod-ing RNAs, such as microRNAs. Pathway-based analysis showed that several lncRNAs modulate PI3K/ Akt/ mTOR, Wnt-β catenin and Notch pathways in the process of cervical cancer pathogenesis. In addition, expression of a handful of lncRNAs has been associated with human papilloma virus infection. Identification of lncRNAs that alter cancer-related signal-ing pathways and subsequent expression analysis of these lncRNAs in patients samples would help to design effective targeted ther-apies.

30544196,SMYD3 promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer.,"SMYD3 is a methylase previously linked to cancer cell invasion and migration. Here we show that SMYD3 favors TGFβ-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in mammary epithelial cells, promoting mesenchymal and EMT transcription factors expression. SMYD3 directly interacts with SMAD3 but it is unnecessary for SMAD2/3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Conversely, SMYD3 is indispensable for SMAD3 direct association to EMT genes regulatory regions. Accordingly, SMYD3 knockdown or its pharmacological blockade with the BCI121 inhibitor dramatically reduce TGFβ-induced SMAD3 association to the chromatin. Remarkably, BCI121 treatment attenuates mesenchymal genes transcription in the mesenchymal-like MDA-MB-231 cell line and reduces their invasive ability in vivo, in a zebrafish xenograft model. In addition, clinical datasets analysis revealed that higher SMYD3 levels are linked to a less favorable prognosis in claudin-low breast cancers and to a reduced metastasis free survival in breast cancer patients. Overall, our data point at SMYD3 as a pivotal SMAD3 cofactor that promotes TGFβ-dependent mesenchymal gene expression and cell migration in breast cancer, and support SMYD3 as a promising pharmacological target for anti-cancer therapy.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2019,"['Fenizia C', 'Bottino C', 'Corbetta S', 'Fittipaldi R', 'Floris P', 'Gaudenzi G', 'Carra S', 'Cotelli F', 'Vitale G', 'Caretti G']",

Ubiquitin‑specific protease 7 (USP7), a member of the deubiquitinating enzyme family, plays a role in the malignancy process of various cancer types by targeting the key oncoprotein; however, its biological function and mechanism in OS have not been elucidated. The present study demonstrated that USP7 expression in OS tumour tissues was markedly higher than that in the paired surrounding tissues, and high USP7 expression was positively correlated with the TNM stage and metastasis in patients with OS. Next, biological function assays demonstrated that USP7 knockdown markedly inhibited OS cell migration and invasion, whereas USP7 overexpression enhanced it. Notably, USP7 can directly bind with β‑catenin to activate the Wnt/β‑catenin signalling pathway and induce epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) of OS cells. Overall, USP7 overexpression could promote OS cell metastasis by activating the Wnt/β‑catenin signalling pathway by inducing EMT, suggesting that USP7 is a potential therapeutic target for OS.",Oncol.

30542713,Curcumin attenuates hyperglycemia-driven EGF-induced invasive and migratory abilities of pancreatic cancer via suppression of the ERK and AKT pathways.,"The relationship between diabetes mellitus and pancreatic cancer is complex. Diabetes has been postulated to be both an independent risk factor and a consequence of pancreatic cancer. Our previous study confirmed that curcumin plays a vital role in inhibiting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of pancreatic cancer cells. However, whether curcumin attenuates hyperglycemia-induced cancer invasive and migratory abilities and the underlying mechanisms are not yet well understood. As high glucose is able to induce the expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF), which is intimately related with tumor progression, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether curcumin could influence the high glucose-induced EGF/EGFR pathway and the biological activity of pancreatic cancer cells. Human pancreatic cancer BxPC-3 cells were exposed to high glucose or EGF, with or without curcumin, LY 294002 (an Akt inhibitor) or PD 98059 (an ERK inhibitor). MTT, Transwell invasion and wound healing assays were used to detect the proliferation, invasion and migration potential of cancer cells. The activation of p-EGFR, p-ERK and p-Akt was determined by western blot analysis. The expression levels of uPA and E-cadherin were examined using qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. The results showed that high glucose could not only promote the proliferation, invasion and migration of pancreatic cancer cells, but also induce the expression of EGF and activation of EGFR, ERK and Akt. These effects of high glucose were counter-balanced by curcumin. EGF-induced proliferative, invasive and migratory abilities of BxPC-3 cells were abrogated by curcumin, LY 294002 and PD 98059. In addition, EGF-modulated activation of EGFR, ERK and Akt, as well as the expression of uPA and E-cadherin were inhibited by curcumin. Taken together, the present study indicates that curcumin suppresses hyperglycemia-driven EGF-induced invasion and migration of pancreatic cancer cells by inhibiting the EGF/EGFR signaling pathway and its downstream signaling molecules including ERK and Akt.

30542703,"Long non‑coding RNA ENST00000547547 inhibits cell proliferation, invasion and migration in colorectal cancer cells.","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common and lethal types of cancer worldwide. Multiple lines of evidence have illustrated that long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical molecules in the regulation of CRC development and progression. The identification of new lncRNAs is expected to provide new biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for CRC diagnosis and prevention. Previous research has revealed that, ENST00000547547, a 434‑bp lncRNA on human chromosome12q15 (RP11‑611E13.3‑001), was found to be downregulated in CRC tissues from lncRNA microarray studies. However, its role in the development and progression of CRC remains largely unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated that the ENST00000547547 level is significantly downregulated in CRC tissues compared to normal tissues. Furthermore, the overexpression of ENST00000547547 inhibited the cell proliferation, invasion and migration of CRC cells in vitro and decreased tumorigenesis ability in vivo. Furthermore, we provided the first evidence that ENST00000547547 inhibited the proliferation of CRC cells by affecting the cell cycle and apoptosis. Finally, we demonstrated that the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) process was associated with the inhibitory effects of ENST00000547547 on the invasion and migration of CRC cells. In summary, the present study indicated that lncRNA ENST00000547547 acted as a tumor suppressor in CRC, which may provide us with a new biomarker for CRC prognosis and a potential therapeutic target for molecular cancer therapy.",Oncol.

30541610,Epigenetic suppression of E-cadherin expression by Snail2 during the metastasis of colorectal cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The transcription factor Snail2 is a repressor of E-cadherin expression during carcinogenesis; however, the specific mechanisms involved in this process in human colorectal cancer (CRC) remain largely unknown.
METHOD: We checked the expression of Snail2 in several clinical CRC specimens. Then, we established Snail2-overexpressing and knockdown cell lines to determine the function of Snail2 during EMT and metastasis processes in CRC. In addition, we used luciferase reporter assay to explore how Snail2 inhibits the expression of E-cadherin and induces EMT.
RESULTS: We found that the expression of Snail2 was higher in clinical specimens of colorectal cancer (CRC) compared to non-cancerous tissues. Overexpression of Snail2 induced migration and metastatic properties in CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, overexpression of Snail2 promoted the occurrence of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), downregulating the expression of E-cadherin and upregulating that of vimentin. Specifically, Snail2 could interact with HDAC6 and then recruited HDAC6 and PRC2 to the promoter of E-cadherin and thus inhibited the expression of E-cadherin, promoting EMT and inducing invasion and metastasis of CRC.
CONCLUSION: Our study reveals that Snail2 might epigenetically suppress the expression of E-cadherin during CRC metastasis.",Clin Epigenetics,2018,"['Hu Y', 'Dai M', 'Zheng Y', 'Wu J', 'Yu B', 'Zhang H', 'Kong W', 'Wu H', 'Yu X']",
30541499,Single-stranded DNA binding protein 2 expression is associated with patient survival in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: SSBP2, single-stranded DNA binding protein 2, is a subunit of the ssDNA-binding complex that is involved in the maintenance of genome stability. The majority of previous studies have suggested a tumor-suppressive role of SSBP2, which is silenced by promoter hypermethylation in several human malignancies, such as hematologic malignancies, prostate cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, ovarian cancer, and gallbladder cancer. However, an oncogenic role of SSBP2 has been suggested in glioblastoma patients. We investigated the clinicopathologic significance of SSBP2 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma.
METHODS: We constructed tissue microarrays consisting of 21 normal liver parenchyma and 213 hepatocellular carcinoma tissues with corresponding adjacent non-neoplastic tissues. SSBP2 expression was investigated by immunohistochemistry, and positive expression was defined as more than 10% of the tumor cells to show nuclear staining. We then analyzed the correlations between SSBP2 expression and various clinicopathologic characteristics, and further studied the role of SSBP2 in cell growth and migration.
RESULTS: Hepatocytes were negative for SSBP2 immunohistochemistry in all normal liver samples, whereas the nuclei of normal bile duct epithelium and sinusoidal endothelium were immunoreactive. Positive immunoreactivity was found in one (0.6%) out of 180 non-neoplastic liver tissue samples adjacent to the tumor and in 16 (8.5%) out of 189 hepatocellular carcinomas. Positive SSBP2 expression was significantly correlated with tumor multifocality (P = 0.027, chi-square test), high histologic grade (P = 0.003, chi-square test), and frequent vascular invasion (P = 0.001, chi-square test). Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that patients with SSBP2 expression had poor prognosis in both disease-free and overall survival (P = 0.004 and P = 0.026, respectively, log-rank test). SSBP2-positive tumors also had a higher Ki-67 proliferation index (P <  0.001, t-test). Furthermore, downregulation of SSBP2 in the Huh7 cell line inhibited cell migration (P = 0.022, t-test) with altered expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers.
CONCLUSIONS: The minority of hepatocellular carcinomas expressed SSBP2 by immunohistochemistry, whereas normal hepatocytes were negative. SSBP2-positive hepatocellular carcinomas were significantly associated with aggressive phenotypes and poor clinical outcome.",BMC Cancer,2018,"['Kim H', 'Kim Y', 'Chung Y', 'Abdul R', 'Sim J', 'Ahn H', 'Shin SJ', 'Paik SS', 'Kim HJ', 'Jang K', 'Choi D']",

We propose that genes that control adult stem cell homeostasis in organs with slow turnover, such as the prostate, control cancer fate. One such gene, KLF4, overexpressed in murine prostate stem cells, regulates their homeostasis, blocks malignant transformation, and controls the self-renewal of tumor-initiating cells. KLF4 loss induces the molecular features of aggressive cancer and converts PIN lesions to invasive sarcomatoid carcinomas; its re-expression in vivo reverses this process. Bioinformatic analysis links these changes to human cancer. KLF4 and its downstream targets make up a gene signature that identifies indolent tumors and predicts recurrence-free survival.

30539341,MiR-101-3p inhibits EMT to attenuate proliferation and metastasis in glioblastoma by targeting TRIM44.,"BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant tumor originating in the brain parenchyma. The invasive and infiltrative properties of glioblastoma result in poor clinical prognosis to conventional therapies. Emerging reports on microRNAs as important regulators during the process of EMT provide new insights into treating glioblastoma through new targets. However, underlying molecular mechanism of the regulation of miR-101-3p in glioblastoma remains unclear.
METHODS: Level of miR-101-3p was determined in GBM cell lines by qRT-PCR. MTT, colony formation and transwell assays were utilized to evaluate functions of overexpression of miR-101-3p/knock down of TRIM44 on proliferation, migration and invasion in GBM cells. Direct interaction between miR-101-3p and TRIM44 was validated using dual luciferase reporter system and impacts of overexpression of miR-101-3p/knock down of TRIM44 on regulation of EMT markers were assessed by Western blotting.
RESULTS: MiR-101-3p was validated to be repressed expressed in glioblastoma cancer cell lines. Both overexpression of miR-101-3p and knock down of TRIM44 attenuated proliferation, migration and invasion of glioblastoma cell lines in vitro. TRIM44 was shown to promote EMT in GBM progress and reverse inhibitory function of miR-101-3p. MiR-101-3p was found to suppress the expression of TRIM44 via directly targeting its 3'UTR.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested miR-101-3p regulated proliferation and migration of glioblastoma cells through attenuating TRIM44 induced EMT via direct targeting 3'UTR of TRIM44, which provided preliminary study of potential therapeutic target in future GBM treatment.",J.

30537744,PGK1 is a Potential Survival Biomarker and Invasion Promoter by Regulating the HIF-1α-Mediated Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Process in Breast Cancer.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Glycolysis, a multi-step enzymatic reaction, is considered to be the root of cancer development and progression. The aim of this study is to figure out which glycolysis enzyme participates in the progression of breast cancer and its possible mechanisms.
MATERIALS: We firstly screened out PGK1 by performing an RT-PCR array of glycolysis-related genes in three paired breast cancer samples, and further investigated PGK1 using TCGA and our own database. The effect and mechanism of PGK1 on cell invasion was further explored both in vitro and using patient samples.
RESULTS: PGK1 was most upregulated in T3N0 with distant metastases compared to those with no metastases. In the TCGA database, high PGK1 expression predicted poor overall survival (OS) in breast cancer and some other cancers (P< 0.001). In the validation cohort, high PGK1 expression was significantly correlated with larger tumor size (P=0.011) and advanced TNM stage (P=0.033), and PGK1 expression was an independent prognostic factor for OS and disease free survival (DFS) in both univariate and multivariate regression analyses (P< 0.05). Functional studies indicated that knockdown of PGK1 expression significantly inhibited invasion and reversed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process in breast cancer cells (P< 0.05). Mechanistically, PGK1 increased HRE luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner, while silencing PGK1 expression decreased HRE activity.
CONCLUSION: High PGK1 expression was associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer, because PGK1 and HIF-1α formed a positive feed-forward loop and thus stimulated breast cancer progression and metastases. Based on these results, PGK1 may serve as a promising biomarker and target therapy for breast cancer.",Cell. Physiol. Biochem.,2018,"['Fu D', 'He C', 'Wei J', 'Zhang Z', 'Luo Y', 'Tan H', 'Ren C']",
30535502,MicroRNA‑143‑3p suppresses cell growth and invasion in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma via targeting the k‑Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) have been identified as an important regulator in carcinogenesis and other pathological processes. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the function of miRNAs in the progression and development of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, the miRNA expression pattern in LSCC tissues was profiled using miRNA microarray analysis. It was found that a large set of miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in LSCC tissues and that miR‑143‑3p was the most markedly downregulated compared with normal tissues. The low expression of miR‑143‑3p was associated with poor prognosis in LSCC. The overexpression of miR‑143‑3p repressed cellular proliferation and induced apoptosis in vitro, and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. The upregulation of miR‑143‑3p suppressed cell migration and invasion through inhibiting the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition cascade. In addition, it was verified that the oncogene k‑Ras is a target of miR‑143‑3p in LSCC cells, and the suppressive effects of miR‑143‑3p on LSCC cells were abrogated by the overexpression of k‑Ras. It was also revealed that miR‑143‑3p may inhibit cell growth and metastasis through targeting the k‑Ras/Raf/mitogen‑activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal‑regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. Taken together, the data indicated that the miR‑143‑3p/k‑Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK axis serves a key regulator in the development and progression of LSCC, suggesting that miR‑143‑3p may be a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in the treatment of LSCC.",Int.

In this study, we identified a novel lncRNA B3GALT5-AS1, which is reduced in colon cancer tissues and further reduced in colon cancer liver metastasis tissues. Reduced expression of B3GALT5-AS1 is associated with liver metastasis and poor outcome of colon cancer patients. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays revealed that B3GALT5-AS1 inhibited proliferation but promoted migration and invasion of colon cancer cells.

We investigated the anti-metastatic and anti-epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) properties of AS in TNBC cells. To determine their EMT and metastasis levels, in vitro wound healing, wound invasion, Western blotting, RT-PCR, luciferase activity and immunofluorescence assays were performed, while the in vivo anti-metastatic efficacy of AS was evaluated in BALB/c-nu mice through bioluminescence imaging, HE staining, and immunohistochemical staining. MDA-MB-231 cells, when treated with AS concentrations (25-100 μg/mL) resulted in significant reduction of invasion and migration as well as the downregulation of VEGF, uPAR, uPA and MMP-9 (inhibition of PI3K/AKT/NFκB pathways). AS treatment prevented morphological changes and reversed EMT through the upregulation of E-cadherin and the downregulation of N-cadherin, Slug, Twist, and Vimentin. Inhibition of Smad3 signaling pathway, downregulation of β-catenin pathway and upregulation of GSK3β expression were also observed while, suppression of metastasis and EMT in TGF-β1-stimulated non-tumorigenic MCF-10A cells was observed when treated with AS. Histological analysis confirmed that AS reduced tumor metastasis and upregulated E-cadherin expression in biopsied lung tissues.

30528239,Claudin-7 downregulation induces metastasis and invasion in colorectal cancer via the promotion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.,"The dysregulation of the tight junctions (TJs) protein claudin-7 is closely related to the development and metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of claudin-7 and characterize the relationship between claudin-7 expression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in CRC. In this study, the expression of claudin-7, E-cadherin, vimentin and snail-1 was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a set of 80 CRC specimens comprising 20 specimens each of well-differentiated, moderately differentiated, poorly differentiated and liver metastases tissues. The correlation between claudin-7 and EMT-related proteins in the stably transfected claudin-7 knockdown HCT116 cell line was analyzed by IHC, immunofluorescence (IF), Western blotting (WB) and nude mouse xenograft models. The results revealed that the expression of claudin-7 was downregulated as CRC tissue differentiation grade decreased, and that low claudin-7 expression corresponded to the downregulation of E-cadherin (r = 0.725, p < 0.001) and upregulation of vimentin (r = -0.376, p = 0.001) and snail-1 (r = -0.599, p < 0.001). Additionally, in the claudin-7 knockdown HCT116 cell line, the staining intensity and expression of E-cadherin was decreased, while the immunoreactivity and expression of vimentin and snail-1 was increased. Futhermore, the result of tumor formation experiment was consistent with CRC tissues. In conclusion, the expression of claudin-7 in CRC is downregulated as differentiation grade decreases. Claudin-7 downregulation may promote the invasion and metastasis of CRC by regulating EMT. Our results provide new perspectives for a potential therapeutic target for CRC.",Biochem. Biophys. Res.

30527240,Histologic pattern of invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal phenotype predict prognosis in squamous carcinoma of the head and neck.,"INTRODUCTION: Disruption of E-cadherin function and increased expression of vimentin and the transcriptional oncogene, SOX2, are thought to characterize epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HNSCC that contributes to invasive and metastatic behavior. To determine if such changes relate to prognosis or host immune response, expression of these markers and correlations with clinical characteristics, histologic worst pattern of invasion (WPOI) and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and survival were assessed.
METHODS: Immunohistologic expression of markers was determined in tissue microarrays from 274 previously untreated HNSCC patients. Expression was correlated with levels of TILs in microcores and WPOI in biopsy specimens. Correlations were assessed by Kruskal-Wallis testing and Spearman correlation coefficients where appropriate. Overall and relapse-free survival were analyzed with Cox proportional hazards models. Median follow up was 60.0 months.
RESULTS: Loss of E-cadherin expression was significantly associated with low or absent SOX2 expression (R = 0.433, p < 0.0001). SOX2 expression and low grade WPOI were significantly associated with favorable overall (OS) and relapse free (RFS) survival in multivariable analysis. E-cadherin expression did not correlate with TILs, however WPOI score correlated indirectly with CD4, CD8, and FoxP3 levels. When grouped by primary treatment, lower grades (1, 2) of WPOI predicted improved RFS and OS in patients treated with primary surgery but not for patients treated with chemoradiation.
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that SOX2 expression and WPOI are significant prognostic factors and that WPOI correlates with decreased T cell infiltration.

In the present study, the upregulation of lncATB in breast cancer cells was validated in a TGF-β-induced EMT model. Gain- and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that lncATB enhanced cell migration, invasion and clonogenicity in vitro and in vivo. LncATB promoted the EMT by acting as a sponge for the miR-200 family and restoring Twist1 expression. Subsequently, the clinical significance of lncATB was investigated in a cohort of breast cancer patients (N = 131). Higher lncATB expression was correlated with increased nodal metastasis (P = 0.036) and advanced clinical stage (P = 0.011) as well as shorter disease-free survival (P = 0.043) and overall survival (P = 0.046).

However, the clinical significance and biological role of IMPDH2 remain poorly understood in colorectal cancer (CRC).
METHODS: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), western blotting analysis, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data mining and immunohistochemistry were employed to examine IMPDH2 expression in CRC cell lines and tissues. A series of in-vivo and in-vitro assays were performed to demonstrate the function of IMPDH2 and its possible mechanisms in CRC.
RESULTS: IMPDH2 was upregulated in CRC cells and tissues at both mRNA and protein level. High IMPDH2 expression was closely associated with T stage, lymph node state, distant metastasis, lymphovascular invasion and clinical stage, and significantly correlated with poor survival of CRC patients. Further study revealed that overexpression of IMPDH2 significantly promoted the proliferation, invasion, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of CRC cells in vitro and accelerated xenograft tumour growth in nude mice. On the contrary, knockdown of IMPDH2 achieved the opposite effect. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that the gene set related to cell cycle was linked to upregulation of IMPDH2 expression. Our study verified that overexpressing IMPDH2 could promote G1/S phase cell cycle transition through activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and PI3K/AKT/FOXO1 pathways and facilitate cell invasion, migration and EMT by regulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.

As annexin A1 (ANXA1) is implicated in the establishment of tumour metastasis, the role of the protein in PC progression as a component of extracellular vesicles (EVs) has been investigated. EVs were isolated from wild type (WT) and ANXA1 knock-out (KO) PC cells and then characterised by multiple approaches including Western blotting, Field Emission-Scanning Electron Microscopy, and Dynamic Light Scattering. The effects of ANXA1 on tumour aggressiveness were investigated by Wound-Healing and invasion assays and microscopic analysis of the Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). The role of ANXA1 on angiogenesis was also examined in endothelial cells, using similar approaches. We found that WT cells released more EVs enriched in exosomes than those from cells lacking ANXA1. Notably, ANXA1 KO cells recovered their metastatic potential only when treated by WT EVs as they underwent EMT and a significant increase of motility. Similarly, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) migrated and invaded more rapidly when treated by WT EVs whereas ANXA1 KO EVs weakly induced angiogenesis. This study suggests that EVs-related ANXA1 is able to promote cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis, confirming the relevance of this protein in PC progression.",Int J Mol Sci,2018,"['Pessolano E', 'Belvedere R', 'Bizzarro V', 'Franco P', 'Marco I', 'Porta A', 'Tosco A', 'Parente L', 'Perretti M', 'Petrella A']",

Here, we report that higher levels of cytoplasmic leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and LIF receptor are correlated with poorer metastasis/recurrence-free survival. Further, single nucleotide variations and signal peptide mutation of LIF are identified in NPC. Cytoplasmic LIF reprograms the invasive mode from collective to mesenchymal migration via acquisition of EMT and invadopodia-associated characteristics. Higher cytoplasmic LIF enhances cancer vascular dissemination and local invasion mechanistically through modulation of YAP1-FAK/PXN signaling. Immunohistochemical analyses of NPC biopsies reveal a positive correlation of cytoplasmic LIF expression with focal adhesion kinases. Pharmaceutical intervention with AZD0530 markedly reverses LIF-mediated cancer dissemination and local invasion through promotion of cytoplasmic accumulation of YAP1 and suppression of focal adhesion kinases.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2000 and 2015, 159 patients with histologically-confirmed rectal adenocarcinoma underwent preoperative CRT followed by surgery. Among them, 70 patients were enrolled and the expression of survivin, cancer stem cell markers (CD44 and CD133) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers (E-cadherin and TWIST1) in pretreatment biopsy specimens were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Associations between the expression of markers and clinical outcomes were evaluated.
RESULTS: The median follow-up period of all patients was 71 (range=15-203) months. Five-year overall (OS), disease-free (DFS), locoregional recurrence-free (LRRFS) and distant metastasis-free (DMFS) survival were 80.5%, 60.2% 90.1% and 76.5%, respectively. A significant association between survivin overexpression and worse treatment outcome was shown on univariate analyses for OS, DFS and DMFS (p=0.022, 0.002, and 0.005, respectively). On multivariate analysis, survivin overexpression was an adverse prognosticator for DFS and DMFS (p=0.007 and 0.015, respectively), with a borderline significant trend towards a shorter OS (p=0.069). Four other single biomarkers were not associated with survival outcomes. However, overexpression of both survivin and CD44 was significantly associated with worse OS on multivariate analysis (p=0.003).
CONCLUSION: Survivin combined with CD44 might be a candidate biomarker for the prediction of recurrence and survival in patients who received preoperative CRT for rectal cancer.

Naringenin has been demonstrated to exhibit multiple cellular functions. In this study, we examined the effects of naringenin on prostate cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transwell and zymography assays were used to detect cell migration and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) activity, respectively. Alternation of protein expression was measured by western blot analysis.
RESULTS: Transwell assay and zymography revealed that naringenin suppressed the migration and invasion of PC-3 cells and uPA activity in proportion to the concentration of naringenin. Western blot analysis indicated that naringenin up-regulated E-cadherin expression, but down-regulated the expression of vimentin, SNAIL family zinc finger 1 (SNAI1), SNAIL family zinc finger 2 (SNAI2), and TWIST family bHLH transcription factor 1 (TWIST1).
CONCLUSION: Naringenin inhibited the migration and invasion of PC-3 cells by reversing expression of proteins involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and down-regulation of uPA activity.

Depletion of TRIM21 promotes the migration and invasion of MCF7 and T47D cells, and changes the expression of genes that regulate EMT. TRIM21 interacts with Snail, a master regulator of EMT. Overexpression of TRIM21 leads to increased ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation of Snail, while depletion of TRIM21 decreases the ubiquitination of Snail. Importantly, depletion of Snail suppresses the increased migration and invasion of MCF7 and T47D cells promoted by depletion of TRIM21.

30502262,COMP Gene Coexpresses With EMT Genes and Is Associated With Poor Survival in Colon Cancer Patients.,"BACKGROUND: About 1.2 million new cases of colon cancer (CC) and 0.6 million deaths are reported every year, establishing CC as an important contributor to worldwide cancer morbidity and mortality. Although the overall incidence and mortality of CC have declined over the past 3 decades, the number of early-onset colon cancer ([EOCC], patients <50 y old) continues to rise alarmingly. These young patients are often diagnosed at a more advanced stage and tend to have poor survival. Our recently published data showed that the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) is overexpressed in early-onset colon cancer patients. COMP is also reported in several cancers to coexpress with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcription factors. Given the role of EMT in cancer metastasis and cell invasion, we assessed the correlation between COMP gene expression and EMT gene expression in CC, and COMP's relationship to patient survival.
METHODS: mRNA expression of COMP was compared to that of EMT markers using the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser. Survival analysis was performed using the UCSC Xena Browser for cancer genomics.
RESULTS: Expression analysis revealed coexpression of COMP with the EMT markers CDH2, FN1, VIM, TWIST1, TWIST2, SNAI1, SNAI2, ZEB1, ZEB2, POSTN, MMP2, MMP9, and COL1A1. Samples that were more mesenchymal had higher expression levels of COMP and EMT markers, thus suggesting a potential role of COMP in EMT. Patients with increased COMP expression presented with poorer overall survival compared to patients with no change or reduced COMP expression (P = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal COMP as a potential biomarker for CC especially in more aggressive CC and CC in young patients, with a likely role in EMT during tumor metastasis and invasion, and a contributing factor to patient survival.",J.

30516195,Diallyl disulphide suppresses the cannonical Wnt signaling pathway and reverses the fibronectin-induced epithelial mesenchymal transition of A549 lung cancer cells.,"Globally, non-small cell lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality and about 40% of these cancers are detected in the metastatic stage. Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a critical role during malignant transformation, and the extracellular matrix component, fibronectin (FN), is a known inducer of invasion and metastasis. Diallyl disulphide (DADS), a bioactive component of garlic, exhibits a wide spectrum of biological activities including the inhibition of cancer cell migration and invasion. The present study was aimed at deciphering the effect of DADS on the regulation of FN-induced EMT in A549 lung cancer cells. DADS suppressed the FN-induced invasion and migration potential of A549 cells which may be attributed to the reduced activity of gelatinases. DADS suppressed the FN-aggravated EMT of A549 cells by the upregulation of the epithelial markers, E-cadherin and cytokeratin-18, and the downregulation of the mesenchymal markers, N-cadherin and vimentin, and the transcription factors, snail, slug and twist. DADS was effective in inhibiting the nuclear translocation of β-catenin and the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β and in suppressing the activity of dishevelled homolog 2 and T-cell-factor/lymphoid enhancer factor in FN-induced A549 cells. Cumulatively, this study indicated that DADS might be able to reverse FN-induced EMT in A549 cells via the suppression of Wnt signaling.",Food Funct,2019,"['Das B', 'Sinha D']",
30514341,Tetraspanin 1 promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and metastasis of cholangiocarcinoma via PI3K/AKT signaling.,"BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have demonstrated that tetraspanin 1 (TSPAN1), a transmembrane protein, functions as an oncoprotein in many cancer types. However, its role and underlying molecular mechanism in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) progression remain unclear.
METHODS: In the present study, the expression of TSPAN1 in human CCA and adjacent nontumor tissues was examined using real-time PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry. The effect of TSPAN1 on proliferation and metastasis was evaluated by functional assays both in vitro and in vivo. A luciferase reporter assay was performed to investigate the interaction between microRNA-194-5p (miR-194-5p) and TSPAN1 3'-untranslated region. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) was used to confirm the interaction between TSPAN1 protein and integrin α6β1 and western blot was used to explore TSPAN1 mechanism.
RESULTS: We found that TSPAN1 was frequently upregulated in CCA and high levels of TSPAN1 correlated with TNM stage, especially metastasis in CCA. TSPAN1 overexpression promoted CCA growth, metastasis, and induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), while its silencing had the opposite effect both in vitro and in vivo. To explore the differential expression of TSPAN1, we screened miR-194-5p as the upstream regulator of TSPAN1. A combination of high-level TSPAN1 and low-level miR-194-5p predicted poor prognosis in patients with CCA. Furthermore, in accordance with the functional characteristics of the TSPAN superfamily, we proved that TSPAN1 interacted with integrin α6β1 to amplify the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β/Snail family transcriptional repressor (Snail)/phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) feedback loop.

30511964,Targeting FOXA1-mediated repression of TGF-β signaling suppresses castration-resistant prostate cancer progression.,"Prostate cancer (PC) progressed to castration resistance (CRPC) is a fatal disease. CRPC tumors develop resistance to new-generation antiandrogen enzalutamide through lineage plasticity, characterized by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and a basal-like phenotype. FOXA1 is a transcription factor essential for epithelial lineage differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that FOXA1 loss leads to remarkable upregulation of transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGFB3), which encodes a ligand of the TGF-β pathway. Mechanistically, this is due to genomic occupancy of FOXA1 on an upstream enhancer of the TGFB3 gene to directly inhibit its transcription. Functionally, FOXA1 downregulation induces TGF-β signaling, EMT, and cell motility, which is effectively blocked by the TGF-β receptor I inhibitor galunisertib (LY2157299). Tissue microarray analysis confirmed reduced levels of FOXA1 protein and a concordant increase in TGF-β signaling, indicated by SMAD2 phosphorylation, in CRPC as compared with primary tumors. Importantly, combinatorial LY2157299 treatment sensitized PC cells to enzalutamide, leading to synergistic effects in inhibiting cell invasion in vitro and xenograft CRPC tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Therefore, our study establishes FOXA1 as an important regulator of lineage plasticity mediated in part by TGF-β signaling, and supports a novel therapeutic strategy to control lineage switching and potentially extend clinical response to antiandrogen therapies.",J.

30509104,MiR-203a functions as a tumor suppressor in bladder cancer by targeting SIX4.,"Increasing evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs) have essential roles in various biological processes, including proliferation, migration, invasion, cell cycle progression and apoptosis. It is considered that miRNA de-regulation contributes to tumor progression and metastasis in various cancers, and MiR-203a has been identified as a tumor suppressor in cancers, such as glioma, gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. Herein, we established that miR-203a expression is significantly lower in bladder cancer tissues than in adjacent normal tissues, and that low miR-203a expression is associated with poor patient outcome. The over-expression of miR-203a inhibited bladder cancer cell proliferation, invasion, migration and EMT in vitro, and its up-regulation led to bladder cancer cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. This over-expression also inhibited the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Bioinformatics prediction software and luciferase reporter assay then confirmed that SIX4 is a direct target of miR-203a. We established negative correlation between SIX4 expression and miR-203a expression in bladder cancer tissues, and SIX4 silencing caused effects similar to miR-203a up-regulation Furthermore, SIX4 over-expression diminished the effects of miR-203a on bladder cancer cells in vitro. In summary, our study determined that miR-203a down-regulation is closely related to tumorigenesis in bladder cancer; thus suggesting that miR-203a is a potential prognostic marker and a potential target in bladder cancer treatment.",Neoplasma,2019,"['Na XY', 'Shang XS', 'Zhao Y', 'Ren PP', 'Hu XQ']",
30509092,KLF11 promotes gastric cancer invasion and migration by increasing Twist1 expression.,"Gastric cancer (GC) is a leading cause of global cancer-related death. The incidence and mortality rates of gastric cancer in China are second and third ranked in all forms of malignant tumors. Krüppel-like factor11 (KLF11) is a member of the KLF family, and previous studies have shown it significantly influences epithelial ovarian, pancreatic and liver cancer proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. However, the expression and some biological functions of KLF11 in GC are still unclear. We therefore collected and analyzed the mRNA and protein expressions of KLF11 in 59 paired gastric cancer tissues and matched healthy gastric tissue samples. We then investigated the KLF 11 biological functions and potential mechanisms in BGC823 and HGC27 gastric cancer cell lines. Analysis of KLF11 in gastric cancer specimens confirmed up-regulation compared to adjacent healthy gastric tissues, and similar results were evident in the GC cell lines. Ectopic expression of KLF11 was significantly associated with GC cell invasion and migration. KLF11 functions were most effective in Twist1 expression and knockdown, and also in KLF11 up-regulation which was accompanied by corresponding change in Twist1 expression; but these effects were inhibited when KLF11 was silenced by the small interfering RNA (siRNA). The relative Twist1 promoter region activity increased gradually with increasing KLF11 plasma, and KLF11 therefore has a critical role in regulating gastric cancer migration and invasion by increasing Twist1 expression. Finally, the results of this study should improve understanding of the KLF11 and EMT regulating network and KLF11's use as a potential therapeutic target in gastric cancer.",Neoplasma,2019,"['Ji Q', 'Li Y', 'Zhao Q', 'Fan LQ', 'Tan BB', 'Zhang ZD', 'Zhao XF', 'Liu Y', 'Wang D', 'Jia N']",
30500808,Downregulation of ERG and FLI1 expression in endothelial cells triggers endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition.,"Endothelial cell (EC) plasticity in pathological settings has recently been recognized as a driver of disease progression. Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), in which ECs acquire mesenchymal properties, has been described for a wide range of pathologies, including cancer. However, the mechanism regulating EndMT in the tumor microenvironment and the contribution of EndMT in tumor progression are not fully understood. Here, we found that combined knockdown of two ETS family transcription factors, ERG and FLI1, induces EndMT coupled with dynamic epigenetic changes in ECs. Genome-wide analyses revealed that ERG and FLI1 are critical transcriptional activators for EC-specific genes, among which microRNA-126 partially contributes to blocking the induction of EndMT. Moreover, we demonstrated that ERG and FLI1 expression is downregulated in ECs within tumors by soluble factors enriched in the tumor microenvironment. These data provide new insight into the mechanism of EndMT, functions of ERG and FLI1 in ECs, and EC behavior in pathological conditions.",PLoS Genet.,2018,"['Nagai N', 'Ohguchi H', 'Nakaki R', 'Matsumura Y', 'Kanki Y', 'Sakai J', 'Aburatani H', 'Minami T']",
30500680,Protein Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Subunit SDS22 Inhibits Breast Cancer Cell Tumorigenesis by Functioning as a Negative Regulator of the AKT Signaling Pathway.,"Protein phosphatases play a crucial role in cell cycle progression, cell survival, cellular signaling, and genomic integrity. The protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) regulatory subunit SDS22 plays a significant role in cell cycle progression. A recent study showed that SDS22 plays a vital role in epithelial integrity and tumor suppression in Drosophila. However, its tumor suppressive activity remains obscure in the mammalian system. Here, for the first time, we show that SDS22 inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells through induction of apoptosis. SDS22 negatively regulates the AKT kinase signaling pathway through PP1. SDS22 associates predominantly with AKT and dephosphorylates the phospho Thr308 and phospho Ser473 through PP1 and hence abrogates the cell migration, invasion, and tumor growth. Thus, our study deciphers the long-standing question of how PP1 negatively regulates the AKT signaling pathway. Further, we observed a significant converse correlation in the expression levels of SDS22 and phospho form of AKT with reduced levels of SDS22 in the higher grades of cancer. Overall, our results suggest that SDS22 could be a putative tumor suppressor and replenishment of SDS22 would be an important strategy to restrict the tumor progression.",Neoplasia,2019,"['Paul D', 'Bargale AB', 'Rapole S', 'Shetty PK', 'Santra MK']",
30499165,Long noncoding RNAs as regulators of cancer immunity.,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly known to be important in cancer as they directly interact with the cell cycle, proliferation pathways and microbiome balance. Moreover, lncRNAs regulate the immune system: they do not directly encode proteins of innate or adaptive immunity, but regulate immune cell differentiation and function, such as dendritic cell activity, T cell ratio and metabolism. The result of this complex interaction is that lncRNAs regulate cancer processes through a complex multimodal system involving immunity, metabolism and infection. The possible functions of lncRNAs and their roles in the regulation of cancer immunity will be reported and discussed in the present review. Recent studies showed their function as regulators in the tumour microenvironment (TME), epithelial-mesenchymal transition, microbiota, metabolism and immune cell differentiation. However, there is not much knowledge regarding their roles in cancer immunity regulation. Thus, the main aim of this review is to describe lncRNAs that have specifically been associated with immunity, the immune cycle and the TME.",Mol Oncol,2019,"['Denaro N', 'Merlano MC', 'Lo Nigro C']",

A PubMed informatics tool indicated a paucity of data in the context of breast cancer, which further prioritized DPYSL3 for study. DPYSL3 knockdown in DPYSL3-positive ([Formula: see text]) CLOW cell lines demonstrated reduced proliferation, yet enhanced motility and increased expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, suggesting that DPYSL3 is a multifunctional signaling modulator. Slower proliferation in DPYSL3-negative ([Formula: see text]) CLOW cells was associated with accumulation of multinucleated cells, indicating a mitotic defect that was associated with a collapse of the vimentin microfilament network and increased vimentin phosphorylation. DPYSL3 also suppressed the expression of EMT regulators SNAIL and TWIST and opposed p21 activated kinase 2 (PAK2)-dependent migration. However, these EMT regulators in turn induce DPYSL3 expression, suggesting that DPYSL3 participates in negative feedback on EMT.

30497437,Protective role of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) against hypoxia-induced malignant potential of non-invasive breast tumor derived cells.,"BACKGROUND: The presence of hypoxic areas is common in all breast lesions but no data clearly correlate low oxygenation with the acquisition of malignant features by non-invasive cells, particularly by cells from ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), the most frequently diagnosed tumor in women.
METHODS: By using a DCIS-derived cell line, we evaluated the effects of low oxygen availability on malignant features of non-invasive breast tumor cells and the possible role of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a well-known anti-leukemic drug, in counteracting the effects of hypoxia. The involvement of the β2 isoform of PI-PLC (PLC-β2), an ATRA target in myeloid leukemia cells, was also investigated by specific modulation of the protein expression.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that moderate hypoxia is sufficient to induce, in DCIS-derived cells, motility, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and expression of the stem cell marker CD133, indicative of their increased malignant potential. Administration of ATRA supports the epithelial-like phenotype of DCIS-derived cells cultured under hypoxia and keeps down the number of CD133 positive cells, abrogating almost completely the effects of poor oxygenation. We also found that the mechanisms triggered by ATRA in non-invasive breast tumor cells cultured under hypoxia is in part mediated by PLC-β2, responsible to counteract the effects of low oxygen availability on CD133 levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we assigned to hypoxia a role in increasing the malignant potential of DCIS-derived cells and we identified in ATRA, currently used in treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), an agonist potentially useful in preventing malignant progression of non-invasive breast lesions showing hypoxic areas.",BMC Cancer,2018,"['Al-Qassab Y', 'Grassilli S', 'Brugnoli F', 'Vezzali F', 'Capitani S', 'Bertagnolo V']",
30496814,The antimetastatic effect and underlying mechanisms of thioredoxin reductase inhibitor ethaselen.,"Treating cancer metastasis is of vital importance to prolong patients' survival. Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) is overexpressed in many cancer types and has been recognized as an anti-cancer target. The organoselenium compound ethaselen (BBSKE) has been proved to be a TrxR inhibitor and inhibit various types of tumor growth. However, whether BBSKE could inhibit tumor metastasis remains unclear. In this study, we aim to explore the antimetastatic effect of BBSKE and underlying mechanisms. BBSKE was found to dose-dependently suppress migration and invasion of MCF-7 and LoVo cells in vitro. The underlying mechanisms may include inhibition of TrxR activity, elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), decrease of EGFR activation and HER2 expression. Besides, the epithelial to mesenchymal transition process and expression of CD44, MMP-9, VEGFR2 and PD-L1 were also abrogated. Decreased migration and invasion, lower expression levels of EGFR, HER2, N-cadherin, CD44, MMP-9, VEGFR2 and PD-L1 were also observed in TrxR1-knockdown MCF-7 and LoVo cells. In the mouse breast cancer 4T1 model, BBSKE not only inhibited progression of primary tumor, but also suppressed formation of metastatic lung nodules and liver micro-metastases, indicating that BBSKE could effectively abolish tumor metastasis. In conclusion, our findings show that BBSKE is able to inhibit migration and invasion of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, and may be used to prevent and treat metastasis.",Free Radic. Biol.

Interestingly, reactive astrocytes, which are present in the tumor edge in association with glioma cells, might also undergo EMT-like under stimuli of GBM cells. As result, the positive feedback of reactive astrocytes and glioma cells, could act to promote cancer progression making use of the dynamism of the mesenchymal phenotype.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not entirely illustrated. Here, we investigated the role of miR-296-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression.
METHODS: In vitro cell morphology, proliferation, migration and invasion were compared between HCC cell lines with up- or down-regulation of miR-296-5p. Immunofluorescence and Western blot immunofluorescence assays were used to detect the expression of EMT markers. Bioinformatics programs, luciferase reporter assay and rescue experiments were used to validate the downstream targets of miR-296-5p. Xenograft nude mouse models were established to observe tumor growth and metastasis. Immunohistochemical assays were conducted to study the relationships between miR-296-5p expression and Neuregulin-1 (NRG1)/EMT markers in human HCC samples and mice.
RESULTS: miR-296-5p was prominently downregulated in HCC tissues relative to adjacent normal liver tissues and associated with favorable prognosis. Overexpression of miR-296-5p inhibited EMT along with migration and invasion of HCC cells via suppressing NRG1/ERBB2/ERBB3/RAS/MAPK/Fra-2 signaling in vitro. More importantly, miR-296-5p disrupted intrahepatic and pulmonary metastasis in vivo. NRG1, as a direct target of miR-296-5p, mediates downstream biological responses. In HCC tissues from patients and mice, the levels of miR-296-5p and NRG1 also showed an inverse relationship.

30483796,Lysine demethylase 2A promotes the progression of ovarian cancer by regulating the PI3K pathway and reversing epithelial‑mesenchymal transition.,"Metastasis is the most common cause of death in ovarian cancer patients but remains largely untreated. Epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) is critical for the conversion of early‑stage ovarian tumors into metastatic malignancies. Thus, investigating the signaling pathways promoting EMT may identify potential targets for the treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer. Lysine demethylase 2A (KDM2A), also known as FBXL11 and JHDM1A, is a histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) demethylase that regulates EMT and the metastasis of ovarian cancer. However, the function and underlying mechanisms of EMT suppression in ovarian cancer have not been thoroughly elucidated to date. In the present study, we used Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases to determine that KDM2A is significantly upregulated in human ovarian cancers. KDM2A expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) borderline ovarian tumors and normal ovary tissues. Seven fresh EOC tissues and 3 fresh normal ovary tissues were collected for western blot analysis. Kaplan‑Meier survival curves were constructed to identify genes related to EOC prognosis from the TCGA data portal. Stable KDM2A‑knockdown cell lines were established to study the biological functions and underlying mechanisms of KDM2A in EMT in vitro. GEO database analysis revealed that KDM2A was highly upregulated in EOC tissues; this analysis was accompanied by immunochemistry and western blot analysis using samples of human tissues. High expression of KDM2A was associated with poor survival in EOC patients. KDM2A knockdown promoted apoptosis and suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of tumor cells in vitro. EMT and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway were suppressed in KDM2A‑silenced cells. Inactivation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in A2780 cells induced EMT inhibition.

METHODS: The distribution of USP37 expression in breast cancer and the correlation between USP37 expression and the overall survival rate were detected by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was utilized to evaluate potential mechanism of USP37 in breast cancer. The USP37 expression in breast cancer tissues and breast cancer cell lines were detected by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Sorting of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) were by using MACS assay. In vitro and in vivo assays were performed to examine the biological functions of USP37 in breast cancer cells. MG132, CHX chase, immunofluorescence staining and co-immunoprecipitation assays were used to test the interaction between USP37 and Gli-1.
RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that USP37 gene was elevated in breast cancer tissues and its overexpression was strongly correlated with the increased mortality rate. GSEA analysis showed that USP37 expression was positively associated with cell growth and metastasis while negatively related to cell apoptosis in the TCGA breast cancer samples. USP37 expression was elevated in breast cancer tissues and breast cancer cell lines. Moreover, we also detected that USP37 was overexpressed in BCSCs. USP37 regulated the ability of cell invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), stemness and cisplatin sensitivity in breast cancer cell lines. Additionally, USP37 knockdown inhibited tumorigenicity and increased anticancer effect of cisplatin in vivo. Knockdown of USP37 significantly decreased hedgehog (Hh) pathway components Smo and Gli-1. Gli-1 was stabilized by USP37 and they interacted with each other. Further studies indicated that USP37 knockdown could inhibit the stemness, cell invasion and EMT in breast cancer via downregulation of Hh pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal that USP37 is highly expressed in BCSCs and is correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. USP37 can regulate the stemness, cell invasion and EMT via Hh pathway, and decreased USP37 confers sensitivity to cisplatin in breast cancer cells. USP37 is required for the regulation of breast cancer progression, as well as a critical target for clinical treatment of breast cancer.",J. Exp. Clin.

30481766,Long Non-Coding RNA XLOC_006753 Promotes the Development of Multidrug Resistance in Gastric Cancer Cells Through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling Pathway.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: The development of multidrug resistance (MDR), which results in disease recurrence and metastasis, is a crucial obstacle to successful chemotherapy for patients with gastric cancer (GC). Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found to play various roles in cancer. This study aimed to investigate the effect of XLOC_006753 on the development of MDR in GC cells.
METHODS: The expression levels of XLOC_006753 in GC patients and MDR GC cell lines (SGC-7901/5-FU and SGC-7901/DDP cell line) were assessed by qRT-PCR. Statistical analyses were conducted to determine the relationship between XLOC_006753 expression and clinical features and to assess the prognostic value of XLOC_006753 for overall survival and progression-free survival. Then, a CCK-8 assay was used to detect cell proliferation ability and chemosensitivity. Flow cytometry was used to detect cell cycle and cell apoptosis. A wound-healing assay and transwell assay were used to detect cell migration. The expression of markers for MDR, G1/S transition, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and PI3K/ AKT/mTOR signaling pathway were examined by western blot.
RESULTS: XLOC_006753 was highly expressed in GC patients and MDR GC cell lines (SGC-7901/5-FU and SGC-7901/DDP cell lines), and its high expression was positively associated with metastasis, TNM stage, tumor size, and poor survival in GC patients. Moreover, XLOC_006753 was an independent prognostic biomarker of overall survival and progression-free survival for gastric cancer patients. Knocking down XLOC_006753 in the two MDR GC cell lines significantly inhibited cell proliferation, cell viability, cell cycle G1/S transition, and migration. XLOC_006753 knockdown also promoted apoptosis. Furthermore, western blots showed that XLOC_006753 knockdown decreased some markers of MDR, G1/S transition, and EMT expression, while increasing caspase9 expression and inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in SGC-7901/5-FU and SGC-7901/DDP cells.

30475758,Targeted regulation by ROCK2 on bladder carcinoma via Wnt signaling under hypoxia.,"Bladder cancer is frequently occurred in urinary system and has complicated pathogenesis factors including both genetics and environmental factors that have not been fully illustrated. Hypoxia can further induce tumor progression. ROCK2 has abnormal expression in various tumors but its expression or functional role in bladder cancer have not been illustrated. In vitro cultured bladder cancer cell line T24 was randomly assigned into control group, hypoxia group (prepared under hypoxic culture), and ROCK2 siRNA group (transfected with ROCK2 siRNA after hypoxia treatment). Real-time PCR and Western bot measured ROCK2 expression. MTT assay tested cell proliferation, and cell migration was quantified. Cell apoptosis was measured by caspase3 activity assay kit and Transwell chamber measured cell migration. Western blot quantified expressional change of HIF-1α and E-cadherin, and Wnt signal pathway proteins including Wnt4, and β-catenin. ROCK2 is up-regulated in bladder cancer T24 cells under hypoxia, and can facilitate cell proliferation, migration and invasion, inhibited Caspase3 activity, enhanced HIF-1α expression, decreased E-cadherin expression, and up-regulated Wnt4 and β-catenin (p< 0.05 comparing to hypoxia group).

30474922,CD44v9 is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition and poor outcomes in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,"CD44 serves as a marker of cancer stem cells. Alternative splicing generates the CD44v9 isoform. Cancer stem cells are associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancers, although little is known about their role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Here, we aimed to clarify the relationship between CD44v9 expression, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and clinicopathological features of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. CD44v9 levels were higher at the tumor invasive front compared with the center of the tumor and higher in metastatic lymph nodes compared with primary tumors. High levels of CD44v9 at the tumor invasive front were significantly associated with deeper tumor invasion and shorter overall survival and recurrence-free survival. The expression of CD44v9 was increased by treatment with transforming growth factor-β, which induced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells to undergo the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, inhibition of CD44v9 expression decreased the migration and invasiveness of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells. These results indicate that the expression of CD44v9 at the tumor invasive front induced by stemness was strongly associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and poor prognosis of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. CD44v9 may therefore serve as a novel prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.",Cancer Med,2018,"['Taniguchi D', 'Saeki H', 'Nakashima Y', 'Kudou K', 'Nakanishi R', 'Kubo N', 'Ando K', 'Oki E', 'Oda Y', 'Maehara Y']",

30474221,High expression of CCR5 in melanoma enhances epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis via TGFβ1.,"Chemokine receptors are highly expressed in various cancers and play crucial roles in tumor progression. However, their expression patterns and functions in melanoma are unclear. The present study aimed to identify the chemokine receptors that play critical roles in melanoma progression and unravel the underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that CCR5 was more abundant in melanoma cells than normal cells and was positively associated with tumor malignancy in clinical patients. Animal experiments suggested that CCR5 deficiency in B16/F10 or A375 cells suppressed primary tumor growth and lung metastasis, whereas CCR5 overexpression in B16/F0 cells enhanced primary tumor growth and lung metastasis. CCR5 played a critical role in proliferation and migration of melanoma cells in vitro. Importantly, CCR5 was required for maintenance of the mesenchymal phenotype of metastatic melanoma cells. Mechanistically, CCR5 positively regulated expression of TGFβ1, which in turn induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition and migration via PI3K/AKT/GSK3β signaling. Collectively, our results establish a critical role of CCR5 expressed by melanoma cells in cancer progression and reveal the novel mechanisms controlling this process, which suggests the prognostic value of CCR5 in melanoma patients and provides novel insights into CCR5-targeted strategies for melanoma treatment.

30473379,Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2): Novel targets in EGFR-mutation positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).,"BACKGROUND: The activation of multiple signaling pathways jeopardizes the clinical efficacy of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in EGFR-mutation positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) regulates the interactions between tumor cells and extracellular environment to activate signaling pathways and promote cell proliferation, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2) is essential for receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation.
METHODS: We analyzed tumor ILK, β-receptor subunit glycoprotein 130 (gp130), SHP2, and stromal hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA expression in baseline tumor specimens of advanced EGFR-mutation positive NSCLC patients treated with EGFR TKIs.
RESULTS: ILK, when highly expressed, was an independent poor prognostic factor for the progression-free survival of the patients, both in the univariate (hazard ratio [HR for disease progression, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.37-4.52; P = .0020]) and in the multivariate (HR 3.74; 95% CI, 1.33-10.56; P = .0126) Cox regression model. Patients with high SHP2 expression had an almost 13-month shorter progression-free survival (P = .0094) and an 18-month shorter overall survival (P = .0182) in comparison to those with low SHP2 mRNA expression.
INTERPRETATION: The levels of ILK and SHP2 could be predictive for upfront combinatory therapy of EGFR TKIs plus SHP2 or ILK inhibitors.

However, the function of KLF5 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unclear. In this study, we found that KLF5 was significantly overexpressed in HCC cell lines and specimens, and high KLF5 expression predicted a poor prognosis for HCC patients. Then, we studied the effects of KLF5 on the proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of HCC cells in vitro and vivo. The inhibition of KLF5 markedly inhibited HCC growth and metastasis, while KLF5 overexpression promoted these processes. In addition, we observed that KLF5 could promote the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HCC via the PI3K/AKT/Snail signaling pathway. The silencing of KLF5 in HCC cell lines downregulated the expression of N-cadherin, Vimentin and Snail and increased the expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin. The expression of MMP2 and MMP9 was also decreased in KLF5-silenced HCC cells. However, opposite results were observed in the KLF5-overexpressing group. These results indicate that KLF5 plays a significant role in HCC progression and metastasis and induces EMT via activating PI3K/AKT/Snail signaling, and the inhibition of KLF5 may be a potential treatment modality for patients with HCC.",Biochem.

However, the underlying mechanisms involved in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression remain poorly understood. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this study, lncRNA array was used to identify HCC related lncRNAs. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) followed mass spectrometry was used to explore lncRNA binding proteins. Western blot, quantitative PCR, tumor sphere formation, migration and viability assay were performed to evaluate the oncogenic role of lncRNAs. RESULTS We identified a novel lncRNA named long stress induced non-coding transcripts 5 (LSINCT5) which facilitates HCC progression. LSINCT5 was significantly upregulated in both HCC specimens and cell lines and correlates with poor survival. In vitro experiments showed that LSINCT5 promoted migration and viability of HepG2 and Huh7 cells. The in vivo xenograft mouse model also confirmed an oncogenic role for LSINCT5. RIP in combination with mass spectrometry identified HMGA2 as the LSINCT5 binding partner. LSINCT5 could bind to HMGA2 and decrease proteasome-mediated HMGA2 degradation leading to EMT activation. LSINCT5 also served as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-4516, resulting in increased STAT3/BclxL expression and attenuated apoptosis.

30472186,The PEAK1-PPP1R12B axis inhibits tumor growth and metastasis by regulating Grb2/PI3K/Akt signalling in colorectal cancer.,"Pseudopodium enriched atypical kinase 1 (PEAK1), a novel non-receptor tyrosine kinase, was recently implicated in cancer pathogenesis. However, its functional role in colorectal cancer (CRC) is not well known. Herein, we demonstrated that PEAK1 was frequently downregulated in CRC and significantly associated with tumor size, differentiation status, metastasis, and clinical stage. PEAK1 overexpression suppressed CRC cell growth, invasion, and metastasis in vitro and in vivo, whereas knockout had the opposite effects. Further evaluation revealed that PEAK1 expression was positively correlated with protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 12B (PPP1R12B) in CRC cell lines and clinical tissues, and this protein was found to suppress activation of the Grb2/PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover, PPP1R12B knockdown markedly abrogated PEAK1-mediated tumor suppressive effects, whereas its upregulation recapitulated the effects of PEAK1 knockout on cell behaviours and the activation of signalling. Mechanistically, PI3K and Akt inhibitors reversed impaired the effect of PEAK1 function on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Our results provide compelling evidence that the PEAK1-PPP1R12B axis inhibits colorectal tumorigenesis and metastasis through deactivation of the Grb2/PI3K/Akt pathway, which might provide a novel therapeutic strategy for CRC treatment.",Cancer Lett.,2019,"['Ding C', 'Tang W', 'Wu H', 'Fan X', 'Luo J', 'Feng J', 'Wen K', 'Wu G']",

Studies have hinted that EGFR antibodies or tyrosine kinase inhibitors were beneficial in patients with EGFR mutation-negative but EGFR-overexpressing of NSCLC. However, the mechanisms underlying EGFR amplification and overexpression in NSCLC remain largely unknown. Here, we report that rs884225, a single nucleotide polymorphism in the EGFR 3'-terminal untranslated region, was significantly associated with EGFR expression level and contributed to NSCLC susceptibility. Mechanistically, the rs884225 C allele enhanced EGFR expression by altering the miR-103a-3p binding site, thus impairing miR-103a-3p's anti-tumourigenic function. As a tumour suppressor gene, miR-103a-3p expression correlated with overall and recurrence-free survival in NSCLC patients. Furthermore, miR-103a-3p inhibited growth and metastasis via effects on the KRAS pathway and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in EGFR wild-type NSCLC cell lines, respectively, which substantially reduced EGFR expression and activity. Thus, rs884225 may be a biomarker for NSCLC susceptibility, and miR-103a-3p may be a potential therapeutic target in NSCLC.",Oncogene,2019,"['Fan Z', 'Yang J', 'Zhang D', 'Zhang X', 'Ma X', 'Kang L', 'Liu Y', 'Yan X', 'Ji Q', 'Wang J', 'Li Y', 'Zhang S', 'Zhu X', 'Hu Y', 'Xu X', 'Ye Q', 'Jiao S']",

However, the regulatory function of circRNA in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is still largely unknown. Present study aimed to explore the role of circ_0006427 in LUAD progression. Firstly, the downregulation of circ_0006427 in LUAD tissues and cell lines was revealed by microarray analysis and qRT-PCR analysis. And we also confirmed the circ_0006427 as a prognostic target in LUAD patients. Functionally, overexpression of circ_0006427 effectively suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Mechanistically, circ_0006427 was found to be predominantly located in the cytoplasm of LUCA cell, and was further revealed to positively regulate DKK1 in LUAD by sponging miR-6783-3p. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analysis and western blot analysis revealed that circ_0006427 inactivated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by upregulating DKK1. At last, rescue assays proved the function of circ_0006427/miR-6783-3p/DKK1 axis in LUAD progression.

Although circZFR has been reported to facilitate the growth of papillary thyroid cancer, the role of circZFR in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are largely unknown. In this study, bioinformatics analysis showed that circZFR was closely related with hepatocellular carcinoma. We then detect the expression of circZFR in HCC tissues using qRT-PCR. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier method and log rank test revealed that high expression of circZFR was associated with the poor prognosis of patients with HCC. Subsequently, loss-of-function assay indicated that circZFR knockdown significantly suppressed cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HCC. In addition, microarray analysis was utilized to identify the differentially expressed mRNAs in response to circZFR knockdown. Moreover, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis further showed that circZFR might regulate Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The results were further confirmed by luciferase reporter assay and western blot assays. Then bioinformatics tools predicted that cicrZFR enhanced the CTNNB1 expression via sponging miR-3619-5p. In summary, our findings indicated that circZFR may exert carcinogenic role in HCC through regulating miR-3619-5p/CTNNB1 axis and activating Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

It is discovered in recent years that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in many biological processes of HCC. However, their specific role in HCC has not been entirely clarified yet. In this research, we aimed to explore biological functions, clinical significance and the underlying molecular mechanisms of lncRNA NR027113 in HCC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: qRT-PCR was performed to test the expression of NR027113 in HCC tissue samples and HCC cell lines. The association of NR027113 expression with overall survival, disease-free survival and clinicopathological factors was analyzed. MTT assays, Colony formation assay, flow cytometry and transwell invasion assays were performed to determine the effect of NR027113 in the regulation of biological behaviors of HCC cells. Western blot was performed to determine the activation of the PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
RESULTS: In the present study, we proved that is significantly up-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. HCC patients with higher NR027113 expression were associated with significantly shorter overall survival and disease-free survival. NR027113 knockdown inhibited the proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells in vitro. In addition, NR027113 knock-down was found to inhibit the activity of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and restrain the EMT process. Furthermore, we found that PTEN silencing could reverse the inhibitory effect of NR027113 knockdown on Akt phosphorylation and HCC cells function.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 30 pairs of PC tissues and adjacent normal tissues were collected in our Department. The expression level of miR-214-5p was detected by quantitative Real-time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Biological information analysis and luciferase report gene assay were used to verify potential target genes of miR-214-5p. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and transwell methods were applied to observe the interference of miR-214-5p on invasion and migration of PC cells. Western blot (WB) assay was applied to determine the expression changes of Jagged 1 (JAG1) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes in PC cells.
RESULTS: QRT-PCR results showed that the expression level of miR-214-5p is significantly down-regulated in PC tissues and cells. Bioinformatics software and luciferase report gene assay identified that JAG1 is a target gene of miR-214-5p. The negative correlation between protein expressions of miR-214-5p and JAG1 was assessed by Western Blot assay. Furthermore, miR-214-5p could suppress cell proliferation, invasion and migration, and it also blocked the EMT in PC cells in vitro. Meanwhile, JAG1 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effects of miR-214-5p on proliferation, invasion and migration of PC cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Overexpressing miR-214-5p could significantly inhibit malignant behavior of PC cells through targeted regulation of JAG1.

30468461,Effects of forkhead Box protein A1 on cell proliferation regulating and EMT of cervical carcinoma.,"OBJECTIVE: Cervical cancer is a common tumor in gynecological malignancies. However, the patients are often in an advanced stage when diagnosed. It was found that forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1) is abnormally expressed in various tumors, such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and is closely related to tumorigenesis. This study aimed to investigate the expression and the related roles of FOXA1 in cervical cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Real Time-PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot were used to analyze expression of FOXA1 in cervical cancer and adjacent tissue. The small-interfere RNA (siRNA) was adopted to down-regulate FOXA1 expression in HeLa cells. The effect of FOXA1 on apoptosis of HeLa cells was detected by using thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. The apoptosis rate of HeLa cells was detected by using flow cytometry. The Western blot was selected to evaluate the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) related protein, vimentin, E-cadherin, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) changes.
RESULTS: Compared with adjacent tissues, FOXA1 mRNA and protein expressions significantly increased in cervical cancer (p<0.05). SiRNA significantly reduced FOXA1 expression in Hela cells compared with the control group and siRNA-NC group, thus inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and enhancing cell apoptosis rate (p<0.05). E-cadherin elevated, Vimentin decreased, and VEGF reduced after FOXA1 siRNA treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: FOXA1 expression increased in cervical cancer. Inhibition of FOXA1 expression blocked the proliferation of cervical cancer, promoted tumor cell apoptosis, suppressed the occurrence of EMT and VEGF production, and can regulate cervical cancer metastasis. FOXA1 can be used as a new molecular biological target for cervical cancer diagnosis and treatment.",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,2018,"['Gu F', 'Li ZH', 'Wang CQ', 'Yuan QF', 'Yan ZM']",
30467667,Curcumin prevented human autocrine growth hormone (GH) signaling mediated NF-κB activation and miR-183-96-182 cluster stimulated epithelial mesenchymal transition in T47D breast cancer cells.,"Autocrine growth hormone (GH) signaling is a promoting factor for breast cancer via triggering abnormal cell growth, proliferation, and metastasis, drug resistance. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a polyphenol derived from turmeric (Curcuma longa), has anti-proliferative, anti-carcinogenic, anti-hormonal effect via acting on PI3K/Akt, NF-κB and JAK/STAT signaling. Forced GH expression induced epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) through stimulation of miR-182-96-183 cluster expression in breast cancer cells. This study aimed to investigate the role of NF-κB signaling and miR-182-96-183 cluster expression profile on autocrine GH-mediated curcumin resistance, which was prevented by time-dependent curcumin treatment in T47D breast cancer cells. Dose- and time-dependent effect of curcumin on T47D wt and GH+ breast cancer cells were evaluated by MTT cell viability and trypan blue assay. Apoptotic effect of curcumin was determined by PI and Annexin V/PI FACS flow analysis. Immunoblotting performed to investigate the effect of curcumin on PI3K/Akt/MAPK, NF-κB signaling. miR182-96-183 cluster expression profile was observed by qRT-PCR. Overexpression of GH triggered resistant profile against curcumin (20 µM) treatment for 24 h, but this resistance was accomplished following 48 h curcumin exposure. Concomitantly, forced GH induced invasion and metastasis through EMT and NF-κB activation were prevented by long-term curcumin exposure in T47D cells. Moreover, 48 h curcumin treatment prevented the autocrine GH-mediated miR-182-96-183 cluster expression stimulation in T47D cells. In consequence, curcumin treatment for 48 h, prevented autocrine GH-triggered invasion-metastasis, EMT activation through inhibiting NF-κB signaling and miR-182-96-183 cluster expression and induced apoptotic cell death by modulating Bcl-2 family members in T47D breast cancer cells.",Mol.

30467386,Analysis of regulator of G-protein signalling 2 (RGS2) expression and function during prostate cancer progression.,"Prostate cancer (PC) represents the second highest cancer-related mortality among men and the call for biomarkers for early discrimination between aggressive and indolent forms is essential. Downregulation of Regulator of G-protein signaling 2 (RGS2) has been shown in PC, however the underlying mechanism has not been described. Aberrant RGS2 expression has also been reported for other carcinomas in association to both positive and negative prognosis. In this study, we assessed RGS2 expression during PC progression in terms of regulation and impact on tumour phenotype and evaluated its prognostic value. Our experimental data suggest that the RGS2 downregulation seen in early PC is caused by hypoxia. In line with the common indolent phenotype of a primary PC, knockdown of RGS2 induced epithelial features and impaired metastatic properties. However, increased STAT3, TWIST1 and decreased E-cadherin expression suggest priming for EMT. Additionally, improved tumour cell survival and increased BCL-2 expression linked decreased RGS2 levels to fundamental tumour advantages. In contrast, high RGS2 levels in advanced PC were correlated to poor patient survival and a positive metastatic status. This study describes novel roles for RGS2 during PC progression and suggests a prognostic potential discriminating between indolent and metastatic forms of PC.",Sci Rep,2018,"['Linder A', 'Hagberg Thulin M', 'Damber JE', 'Welén K']",
30466982,trans-3-Methoxy-5-hydroxystilbene (MHS) from the rhizome of Alpinia nantonensis inhibits metastasis in human lung cancer cells.,"BACKGROUND: Alpinia nantoensis (Zingiberaceae) is an aromatic plant endemic to Taiwan, which is used as food flavoring and traditional herbal medicine. The biological activities of compounds isolated from this plant are rarely investigated.
PURPOSE: The present study was aimed to investigate the anti-metastatic potential of trans-3‑methoxy‑5-hydroxystilbene (MHS) a major stilbene isolated from the rhizomes of A. nantonensis.
METHODS: We investigated the anti-metastatic potential of MHS on human non-small cell lung carcinoma (A549) cell line using wound healing, trans-well, western blot, zymography and immunofluorescence assays.
RESULTS: Initial cytotoxicity assay showed that treatment with MHS did not exhibit cytotoxicity to A549 cells up to the concentration of 40 µM. Further in vitro wound healing and transwell chamber assays revealed that MHS significantly inhibited tumor cell migration in a dose-dependent manner, which is associated with inhibition of matrix mettalloprotinase-2 (MMP-2) and matrix mettalloprotinase-9 (MMP-9) at both enzyme and protein levels. The inhibition of MMPs activity by MHS was reasoned by suppression of their corresponding transcription factor, β-catenin as indicated by reduced levels of β-catenin in the nucleus. MHS also regulates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by increasing E-cadherin and occludin as well as decreasing N-cadherin levels in A549 cells. Furthermore, pre-treatment with MHS significantly inhibited A549 cells migration and EMT in TGF-β induced A549 cells.
CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that MHS, a plant-derived stilbene has a promising ability to inhibit lung cancer cell metastasis in vitro.",Phytomedicine,2018,"['Kumar KJS', 'Wang SH', 'Tseng YH', 'Tsao NW', 'Kuo YH', 'Wang SY']",
30466467,Helicobacter pylori CagA promotes epithelial mesenchymal transition in gastric carcinogenesis via triggering oncogenic YAP pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) delivers oncoprotein CagA into gastric epithelial cells via the T4SS and drives activation of multiple oncogenic signalling pathways. YAP, a core effector of the Hippo tumour suppressor pathway, is frequently overexpressed in human cancers, suggesting its potential tumor-promoting role. Although CagA is a casual factor in H. pylori induced gastric carcinogenesis, the link between CagA and YAP pathway has not been identified. In this work, we investigated the regulation of oncogenic YAP pathway by H. pylori CagA.
METHODS: Expression of YAP and E-cadherin protein in human gastric biopsies were assessed by immunohistochemistry. H. pylori PMSS1 cagA
RESULTS: YAP is significantly upregulated in human gastric carcinogenesis. We generated PMSS1 CagA isogenic mutant strains with chloramphenicol resistance successfully. Our analysis indicated that H. pylori infection induced YAP and downstream effectors in gastric epithelial cells. Importantly, knockout of CagA in 7.13 and PMSS1 strains reduced the expression of YAP by H. pylori infection. Moreover, Inhibition of YAP suppressed H. pylori infection-induced Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that H. pylori CagA as a pathogenic protein promotes oncogenic YAP pathway, which contributes to EMT and gastric tumorigenesis.

30466075,miR-33a Mediates the Anti-Tumor Effect of Lovastatin in Osteosarcoma by Targeting CYR61.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Preventing cell metastasis is an effective therapeutic strategy to treat osteosarcoma and improve prognosis. Statins have been found to have anticancer effects in addition to their cholesterol-lowering action. As a new target of statins, cysteine-rich 61 (CYR61) was recently identified to promote cell migration and metastasis in osteosarcoma. However, the underlying mechanisms mediating the regulation of CYR61 expression by statins remain unknown.
METHODS: Human osteosarcoma cell lines MG63 and SaOS2 were used to clarify the effect of lovastatin on CYR61 expression. Real-time PCR was performed to detect mRNA or microRNA (miRNA) levels and western blot was performed to detect protein levels. Cell invasive ability was determined using Transwell assays. Lentivirus encoding CYR61 cDNA or sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP-2) shRNA was used to upregulate CYR61 expression or downregulate SREBP-2 expression. Binding of the CYR61 3' untranslated region (UTR) and miR-33a was analyzed by luciferase reporter assay.
RESULTS: We found that lovastatin treatment decreased CYR61 expression, inhibited cell invasion and altered epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition (EMT)-related protein expression, while CYR61 overexpression abolished the effect of lovastatin. Moreover, lovastatin increased the expression of SREBP-2 and miR-33a, which were then downregulated by SREBP-2 silencing. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the CYR61 3'UTR harbored a potential miR-33a binding site and luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that CYR61 was a target of miR-33a in osteosarcoma cells. Furthermore, miR-33a could inhibit cell invasion and alter EMT-related protein expression. SREBP-2 silencing or miR-33a inhibitor upregulated CYR61 expression and reversed the effects of lovastatin on cell invasion and EMT-related proteins.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest lovastatin suppresses osteosarcoma cell invasion through the SREBP-2/miR-33a/CYR61 pathway.",Cell. Physiol. Biochem.,2018,"['Huang Y', 'Zhang J', 'Shao H', 'Liu J', 'Jin M', 'Chen J', 'Zhao H']",
30465755,"Knockdown on aPKC-ι inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration and invasion of colorectal cancer cells through Rac1-JNK pathway.","BACKGROUND: Atypical protein kinase C-ι (aPKC-ι) is an oncogenic factor, and required for the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of different types of cancer. Our study aimed to investigate the role of aPKC-ι in the EMT, migration and invasion of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells.
METHODS: Expression of aPKC-ι was evaluated in CRC cell lines treated with TGF-β1 using qPCR and western blot. After aPKC-ι was knocked down using shRNA, migration and invasion abilities of CRC cell lines were evaluated by wound healing assay and transwell assay, respectively. Activation status of downstream signaling factors of aPKC-ι, including Rac1, JNK, STAT3 and β-catenin, was measured using western blot. Furthermore, auranofin, an aPKC-ι inhibitor, was used to treat CRC cell lines to investigate its possible inhibition on the EMT of CRC cell lines, as well as on the expression of aPKC-ι and its downstream signaling factors.
RESULTS: TGF-β1 induced the expression of aPKC-ι in CRC cells, and knockdown on aPKC-ι inhibited the TGF-β1-induced EMT, migration and invasion of CRC cells. Interestingly, Rac1 GTPase level was decreased when aPKC-ι was knocked down, and overexpression of Rac1G12V rescued the cell EMT, migration and invasion in CRC cells as inhibited by sh-aPKC-ι. Moreover, knockdown on aPKC-ι suppressed the phosphorylation of JNK and STAT3, and nuclear translocation of β-catenin. The aPKC- ι inhibitor, Auranofin, showed similar inhibitory effects as aPKC-ι knockdown.
CONCLUSION: Knockdown on aPKC-ι inhibited the EMT, migration and invasion of CRC cells through suppressing of Rac1-JNK pathway. Those findings indicate that aPKC-ι may serve as a novel therapeutic target for CRC.",Exp. Mol. Pathol.,2019,"['Du GS', 'Qiu Y', 'Wang WS', 'Peng K', 'Zhang ZC', 'Li XS', 'Xiao WD', 'Yang H']",
30465208,Molecular Characterization of Circulating Tumor Cells to Study Cancer Immunoevasion.,"Cancer cells leaving the primary tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment become vulnerable to active immune surveillance and require mechanisms of immunoevasion to survive in the circulation. Studies have identified several pathways by which circulating tumor cells (CTCs) might escape the immune system/immunotherapy attack. The PD-1/PD-L1 axis is an immune checkpoint regulator, playing a major role in maintaining self-tolerance. It is now well recognized that tumor cells co-opt the PD-1/PD-L1 axis of immune regulation to interfere with cytotoxic T lymphocyte function. Transcriptional changes in CTCs, leading to the upregulation of PD-L1, might enable them to survive in circulation. Very recent data revealed a previously unappreciated role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in reprogramming the immune response in the local tumor microenvironment and a mutual regulation between EMT and immunoevasion is becoming apparent. In this chapter, we will describe in detail both EpCAM-dependent and -independent approaches that allow the identification of PD-L1 expression and EMT-like features in circulating tumor cells.",Methods Mol.

30459355,Oncogenic activity of poly (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase.,"Poly (ADP-ribosylation), known as PARylation, is a post-translational modification catalyzed by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) and primarily removed by the enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG). While the aberrant removal of post-translation modifications including phosphorylation and methylation has known tumorigenic effects, deregulation of PARylation has not been widely studied. Increased hydrolysis of PARylation chains facilitates cancer growth through enhancing estrogen receptor (ER)-driven proliferation, but oncogenic transformation has not been linked to increased PARG expression. In this study, we find that elevated PARG levels are associated with a poor prognosis in breast cancers, especially in HER2-positive and triple-negative subtypes. Using both in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrate that heightened expression of catalytically active PARG facilitates cell transformation and invasion of normal mammary epithelial cells. Catalytically inactive PARG mutants did not recapitulate these phenotypes. Consistent with clinical data showing elevated PARG predicts poor outcomes in HER2+ patients, we observed that PARG acts in synergy with HER2 to promote neoplastic growth of immortalized mammary cells. In contrast, PARG depletion significantly impairs the growth and metastasis of triple-negative breast tumors. Mechanistically, we find that PARG interacts with SMAD2/3 and significantly decreases their PARylation in non-transformed cells, leading to enhanced expression of SMAD target genes. Further linking SMAD-mediated transcription to the oncogenicity of PARG, we show that PARG-mediated anchorage-independent growth and invasion are dependent, at least in part, on SMAD expression. Overall, our study underscores the oncogenic impact of aberrant protein PARylation and highlights the therapeutic potential of PARG inhibition in breast cancer.",Oncogene,2019,"['Marques M', 'Jangal M', 'Wang LC', 'Kazanets A', 'da Silva SD', 'Zhao T', 'Lovato A', 'Yu H', 'Jie S', 'Del Rincon S', 'Mackey J', 'Damaraju S', 'Alaoui-Jamali M', 'Witcher M']",
30455428,EGFL6 promotes breast cancer by simultaneously enhancing cancer cell metastasis and stimulating tumor angiogenesis.,"EGFL6, a member of the EGF-like superfamily, plays an important role during embryonic development and has been implicated in promotion of tumor angiogenesis without affecting wound healing. There is very little known about the function of EGFL6 in cancer cells. Here, we investigated whether EGFL6 plays a direct role in cancer cells in addition to the promotion of tumor angiogenesis. Our study showed that EGFL6 promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness of breast cancer cells and increased cell migration and invasion in cell culture studies. We also found that EGFL6 reduced apoptotic signaling in cancer cells and promoted tumor growth in vivo. Importantly, expression of EGFL6 in cancer cells and tumor endothelial cells not only increased tumor angiogenesis but also promoted migration of cancer cells. Such dual engagement of cancer and stromal cells suggests crosstalk mediated by EGFL6 in the tumor microenvironment. Blockade of EGFL6 using our novel anti-EGFL6 monoclonal antibody significantly reduced cancer cell migration, tumor angiogenesis, and tumor growth in mouse xenograft tumor models. Silencing EGFL6 mRNA by shRNA transfection of cancer cells also significantly reduced cancer cell migration, tumor angiogenesis, and tumor growth in mouse xenograft tumor models. Taken together, the results of this study indicate that targeting EGFL6 is a unique strategy for inhibiting both cancer cell metastasis and tumor angiogenesis.",Oncogene,2019,"['An J', 'Du Y', 'Fan X', 'Wang Y', 'Ivan C', 'Zhang XG', 'Sood AK', 'An Z', 'Zhang N']",
30454902,"MFAP5 suppression inhibits migration/invasion, regulates cell cycle and induces apoptosis via promoting ROS production in cervical cancer.","Cervical cancer is one of the most lethal types of cancer among female. Microfibrillar-associated protein 5 (MFAP5) is an extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein, and is confirmed to be involved in cell signaling during microfibril assembly, elastinogenesis and cell survival. However, the role of MFAP5 in cervical cancer development and progression remains poorly understood. In the study, MFAP5 was over-expressed in human cervical cancers, and in different cervical cancer cell lines. Patients suffering from cervical cancer with low MFAP5 expression exhibited better survival rate. Suppressing MFAP5 in cervical cancer cells markedly reduced the cell proliferation, migration and invasion by modulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related signaling pathway. In addition, MFAP5 knockdown induced large number of cells distributed in G2/M phase, along with reduced Cyclin B1, Cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) expressions, and enhanced p21 and p53 levels. Moreover, apoptosis was highly induced by MFAP5 silence through reducing Bcl-xl and Bcl-2 expressions, and promoting Bax, cleaved Caspase-3 and poly (ADP-Ribose) polymerase (PARP) expressions in cervical cancer cells. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production levels were also higher in MFAP5-knockdown cells, along with Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation. Importantly, we found that MFAP5 knockdown-inhibited cervical cancer cell growth was dependent on ROS production. Finally, the depletion of MFAP5 prevented cervical cancer progression in vivo. In summary, our study identified a critical role played by MFAP5 in the progression of cervical cancer and the potential mechanisms by which exerted its effects, indicating that targeting MFAP5-related pathways could be conducive to the therapies for cervical cancer.",Biochem.

30454901,AURKA contributes to the progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) through modulating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and apoptosis via the regulation of ROS.,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is known as one of the most common cancer influencing the head and neck region. However, the molecular mechanisms revealing OSCC progression is largely unclear. Aurora kinase A (AURKA) is a serine-threonine kinase that functions in mitotic spindle formation and chromosome segregation, and is associated with the progression of human cancers. But its role in regulating OSCC development has not yet been investigated. In the study, we found that AURKA expression was up-regulated in OSCC cell lines and tumor specimens from patients. OSCC patients with high expression of AURKA exhibited a significant decreased overall survival rate. In vitro, AURKA knockdown markedly reduced the proliferation, migration and invasion of OSCC cells using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), EdU, colony formation and transwell analysis. EMT was suppressed by AURKA silence, as evidenced by the up-regulated expression of E-cadherin and down-regulated Vimentin in OSCC cells. In addition, apoptosis was markedly induced by AURKA inhibition through promoting the expression of cleaved Caspase-3 and poly (ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was also markedly enhanced in AURKA-knockdown OSCC cells. Importantly, we found that repressing ROS generation using its scavenger of n-acetylcysteine (NAC) significantly abolished AURKA silence-induced apoptosis, accompanied with restored proliferation and EMT. In vivo, AURKA knockdown notably inhibited tumor growth. Therefore, knockdown of AURKA suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and also induced apoptosis and ROS generation in OSCC possibly via the production of ROS, demonstrating that AURKA inhibition might represent a novel therapeutic target for the prevention of OSCC.",Biochem.

30454010,The pro-metastasis effect of circANKS1B in breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies indicate that circular RNA (circRNA) plays a pivotal role in cancer progression. Here, we sought to investigate its role in breast cancer.
METHODS: CircANKS1B (a circRNA originated from exons 5 to 8 of the ANKS1B gene, hsa_circ_0007294) was identified by RNA-sequencing and validated by qRT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. Clinical breast cancer samples were used to evaluate the expression of circANKS1B and its associations with clinicopathological features and prognosis. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments in cell lines and mouse xenograft models were performed to support clinical findings and elucidate the function and underlying mechanisms of circANKS1B in breast cancer.
RESULTS: CircANKS1B was significantly up-regulated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) compared with non-TNBC tissues and cell lines. Increased circANKS1B expression was closely associated with lymph node metastasis and advanced clinical stage and served as an independent risk factor for overall survival of breast cancer patients. Functional studies revealed that circANKS1B promoted breast cancer invasion and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo by inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), while had no effect on breast cancer growth. Mechanistically, circANKS1B abundantly sponged miR-148a-3p and miR-152-3p to increase the expression of transcription factor USF1, which could transcriptionally up-regulate TGF-β1 expression, resulting in activating TGF-β1/Smad signaling to promote EMT. Moreover, we found that circANKS1B biogenesis in breast cancer was promoted by splicing factor ESRP1, whose expression was also regulated by USF1.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data uncover an essential role of the novel circular RNA circANKS1B in the metastasis of breast cancer, which demonstrate that therapeutic targeting of circANKS1B may better prevent breast cancer metastasis.",Mol.

METHODS: HCC and para-cancerous tissues were collected from 136 HCC patients. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of JAK2 and STAT3. HCC SMMC7721 cells were grouped into blank, negative control (NC), HOST2 mimic and HOST2 inhibitor groups. The mRNA and protein expression levels of HOST2, JAK2, STAT3, E-cadherin, vimentin, Snail, Slug, Twist and Zeb1 in tissues and cells were determined by reverse transcription -quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blotting, respectively. An MTT assay, scratch test and Transwell assay were applied to measure cell proliferation, migration and invasion, respectively.
RESULTS: The levels of JAK2, STAT3 and vimentin were higher in HCC tissues, while the expression of E-cadherin was lower in HCC tissues compared with para-cancerous tissues. The silencing of HOST2 significantly decreased cell proliferation, migration and invasion, reduced the levels of HOST2, JAK2, STAT3 and vimentin, and elevated the expression of E-cadherin. HOST2 silencing also decreased the levels of Snail, Slug and Twist but increased the level of Zeb1 protein, while the opposite findings were observed in the HOST2 mimic group.

The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is associated with EMT, but whether miR-197 regulatesWnt/β-catenin remains unclear. This study was to demonstrate the role of miR-197 on the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
METHODS: Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of miR-197 in 105 HCC specimens and 15 HCC cell lines. We tested the predicted target gene of miR-197 using a genetic report system. The role of miR-197 in HCC cell invasion and migration (wound healingand cell invasion and migrationby Transwell assays) and in an HCC xenograft modelwas analyzed.
RESULTS: Using a miRNA microarray analysis of HCC specimens and compared with non-metastatic HCC, miR-197 was identified as one of the most upregulated miRNAs in metastatic HCC. miR-197 expression was positively associated with the invasiveness of HCC cell lines. Metastatic HCC cells with high miR-197 expression had Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation. High levels of miR-197 expression also promoted EMT and invasionHCC cells in vitro and in vivo. miR-197 directly targeted Axin-2, Naked cuticle 1 (NKD1), and Dickkopf-related protein 2 (DKK2), leading to inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

30453285,Doublecortin-Like Kinase 1 (DCLK1) Regulates B Cell-Specific Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus Insertion Site 1 (Bmi-1) and is Associated with Metastasis and Prognosis in Pancreatic Cancer.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are largely responsible for tumor relapse and metastatic behavior. Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) was recently reported to be a biomarker for gastrointestinal CSCs and involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor progression. B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (Bmi-1) is a crucial regulator of CSC self-renewal, malignant transformation and EMT, and a previous study from our group showed that Bmi-1 is upregulated in pancreatic cancer progression and participates in EMT. However, it remains unclear whether DCLK1 is involved in pancreatic cancer or whether DCLK1 is associated with the altered level of Bmi-1 expression.
METHODS: The correlation of DCLK1 expression and clinical features of pancreatic cancer was analyzed in 210 paraffin-embedded archived pancreatic cancer specimens by immunohistochemical analysis. The biological effects of DCLK1 siRNA on cells were investigated by examining cell proliferation using a cell counting kit and cell colony assays, cell migration by wound healing assay and cell invasion by Transwell invasion assay. We further investigated the effect of therapeutic siRNA targeting DCLK1 on pancreatic cancer cell growth in vivo. Moreover, the molecular mechanism by which DCLK1 upregulates Bmi-1 expression was explored using real-time PCR, western blotting and Co-immunoprecipitation assay.
RESULTS: DCLK1 is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer and is related to metastasis and prognosis. Knockdown of DCLK1 markedly suppressed cell growth in vitro and in vivo and also inhibited the migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, we found that DCLK1 silencing could inhibit EMT in cancer cells via downregulation of Bmi-1 and the mesenchymal markers Snail and Vimentin and upregulation of the epithelial marker E-cadherin. Moreover, high DCLK1 expression in human pancreatic cancer samples was associated with a mesenchymal phenotype and increased cell proliferation. Further co-immunoprecipitation indicated that DCLK1 did not interact with Bmi-1 directly.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that upregulation of DCLK1 may contribute to pancreatic cancer metastasis and poor prognosis by increasing Bmi-1 expression indirectly.

The mechanisms by which Gal-1 promotes GC metastasis remain unknown.
METHODS: Gal-1and Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) were determined by immunohistochemistry(IHC) and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in GC specimens. Stably transfected Gal-1 or S1PR1 into SGC7901 and MGC-803 cells, western blot and invasion assays in vitro and nude mice tumorigenicity in vivo were also employed.
RESULTS: Overexpression of Gal-1 enhanced expression of S1PR1 in SGC-7901 cells, and increased cell invasion, while knockdown Gal-1 in MGC-803 cells reduced S1PR1 expression and diminished invasion. Simultaneous knockdown of Gal-1 and overexpression of S1PR1 in MGC803 cells rescued invasive ability of MGC803 cells. S1PR1 was associated with expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in vitro and in clinical samples. EMT induced in MGC-803 cells by TGF-β1 was accompanied by S1PR1 activation, while knockdown of S1PR1 reduced response to TGF-β1, suggest that Gal-1 promotes GC invasion by activating EMT through a S1PR1-dependent mechanism. Overexpression of S1PR1 promoted subcutaneous xenograft growth and pulmonary metastases, and enhanced expression of EMT markers.

Here, we investigated the role of connexin 43 (Cx43) and its derived GJIC in the interplay between non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs).
METHODS: CAFs and NSCLC cells were co-cultured with direct contact and separated using flow cytometry. Glucose uptake, lactate production, and the expression and activity of PKM-2 and LDH-A in sorted CAFs were measured by a colorimetric assay, western blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Meanwhile, E-cadherin and N-cadherin expression and the migration and invasion of sorted NSCLC cells were detected by western blotting, wound width, and Transwell assays. Pyruvate, acetyl-CoA, and citric acid levels, ATP levels, and LDH-B and α-KG activity in sorted NSCLC cells were determined by a colorimetric or fluorometric assay and ELISA, respectively. Functional GJIC between cells and the subcellular location of connexins were detected by a ""Parachute"" assay and immunofluorescence. Levels of α-SMA, Cx43, and LDH-B in tissue from patients with NSCLC were determined by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Cx43 accumulated in the plasma membrane, which favored the assembly of asymmetric unidirectional GJIC from CAFs to NSCLC cells. CAFs underwent increased aerobic glycolysis and promoted the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration, and invasion of NSCLC cells. In contrast, NSCLC cells experienced enhanced oxidative phosphorylation upon CAF stimulation, with an increase in ATP generation and thereby activation of the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways. Metabolic coupling between CAFs and NSCLC cells was under the strict control of Cx43-formed unidirectional GJIC. Patients with high tri-expression of α-SMA, Cx43, and LDH-B had the shortest overall survival and relapse-free survival compared with those with individual overexpression or high bi-expression.
CONCLUSION: Cx43-formed unidirectional GJIC plays a critical role in mediating close metabolic cooperation between CAFs and NSCLC cells to support the malignant progression of NSCLC.",Cell. Physiol.

30452490,Hyper-phosphorylation of Rb S249 together with CDK5R2/p39 overexpression are associated with impaired cell adhesion and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition: Implications as a potential lung cancer grading and staging biomarker.,"Prediction of lung cancer metastasis relies on post-resection assessment of tumor histology, which is a severe limitation since only a minority of lung cancer patients are diagnosed with resectable disease. Therefore, characterization of metastasis-predicting biomarkers in pre-resection small biopsy specimens is urgently needed. Here we report a biomarker consisting of the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) on serine 249 combined with elevated p39 expression. This biomarker correlates with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition traits in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells. Immunohistochemistry staining of NSCLC tumor microarrays showed that strong phospho-Rb S249 staining positively correlated with tumor grade specifically in the squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) subtype. Strong immunoreactivity for p39 positively correlated with tumor stage, lymph node invasion, and distant metastases, also in SCC. Linear regression analyses showed that the combined scoring for phospho-Rb S249, p39 and E-cadherin in SCC is even more accurate at predicting tumor staging, relative to each score individually. We propose that combined immunohistochemistry staining of NSCLC samples for Rb phosphorylation on S249, p39, and E-cadherin protein expression could aid in the assessment of tumor staging and metastatic potential when tested in small primary tumor biopsies. The intense staining for phospho-Rb S249 that we observed in high grade SCC could also aid in the precise sub-classification of poorly differentiated SCCs.",PLoS ONE,2018,"['Pérez-Morales J', 'Mejías-Morales D', 'Rivera-Rivera S', 'González-Flores J', 'González-Loperena M', 'Cordero-Báez FY', 'Pedreira-García WM', 'Chardón-Colón C', 'Cabán-Rivera J', 'Cress WD', 'Gordian ER', 'Muñoz-Antonia T', 'Cabrera-Ríos M', 'Isidro A', 'Coppola D', 'Rosa M', 'Boyle TA', 'Izumi V', 'Koomen JM', 'Santiago-Cardona PG']",
30451837,EPH receptor A2 governs a feedback loop that activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling in gastric cancer.,"The erythropoietin-producing hepatoma (EPH) receptor A2 (EphA2) belongs to the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases. EphA2 is highly correlated with the formation of many solid tumors and has been linked to the dysregulation of signaling pathways that promote tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion as well as angiogenesis. Deregulation of Wnt signaling is implicated in many forms of human disease including gastric cancer. We previously reported that EphA2 promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition through Wnt/β-catenin signaling in gastric cancer. Herein, we present a novel mechanism by which EphA2 regulates Wnt/β-catenin signaling. EphA2 acts as a receptor for Wnt ligands and recruits Axin1 to the plasma membrane by directly binding Dvl2. The EphA2-Dvl2/Axin1 interaction was enhanced by Wnt3a treatment, suggesting that EphA2 acts as a functional receptor for the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and plays a vital role in downstream signaling. We showed that Dvl2 mediates the EphA2-Axin1 interaction by binding to the tyrosine kinase domain of EphA2. We propose that EphA2/Dvl2/Axin1 forms a complex that destabilizes the β-catenin destruction complex and allows β-catenin to translocate to the nucleus and initiate the transcription of c-MYC, the primary Wnt signaling target gene. Intriguingly, c-MYC could bind directly to the EphA2 and Wnt1 promoter to enhance their transcription. The entire process formed an EphA2-mediated feed-forward loop. A small molecular inhibitor of EphA2 potently inhibited the proliferation of gastric cancer in vitro and in vivo, including gastric cancer patient-derived xenografts. Thus, our data identify EphA2 as an excellent candidate for gastric cancer therapy.",Cell Death Dis,2018,"['Peng Q', 'Chen L', 'Wu W', 'Wang J', 'Zheng X', 'Chen Z', 'Jiang Q', 'Han J', 'Wei L', 'Wang L', 'Huang J', 'Ma J']",
30451796,Expression of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Proteins in Pancreatic Anaplastic (Undifferentiated) Carcinoma.,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify an association of pancreatic anaplastic carcinoma (APC) with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
METHODS: Resected APCs (n = 24) were examined to assess components of APCs, including carcinomatous, transitional, and sarcomatous regions. Analysis was performed based on the immunoreactivity of E-cadherin and 3 EMT-related proteins: Slug (zinc finger protein SNAI2), Twist (Twist-related protein 1), and Zeb1 (zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1). Expression score was determined based on staining intensity and stained area of the target cells. Finally, we performed a hierarchical clustering based on the expression pattern of E-cadherin and EMT-related proteins of the sarcomatous component.
RESULTS: The expression score of E-cadherin decreased in the order of sarcomatous > transitional > carcinomatous components (P < 0.01). Although there were significant differences in the immunohistochemical scores of Slug, Twist, and Zeb1 between carcinomatous and transitional components (P < 0.01), the significant difference in immunohistochemical score of Zeb1 between transitional and sarcomatous components was found (P < 0.05). Furthermore, APCs were divided into 2 subgroups based on the expression patterns of E-cadherin and EMT-related proteins (hierarchical clustering analysis). Consequently, these subgroups were distinguished by Twist expression.

This study aimed, using a large patient cohort and in vitro models, to verify its importance and further investigate the role in ovarian cancer chemoresponse.
METHODS: Calpain-1, calpain-2, calpain-4 and calpastatin expression were evaluated in primary ovarian carcinomas (n = 575) by immunohistochemistry. Protein expression was assessed, via western blotting, in five ovarian cancer cell lines with various sensitivities towards cisplatin/carboplatin. In vitro calpain activity was inhibited by calpeptin treatment to assess changes in platinum sensitivity by proliferation assay, with expression of genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition being examined by RT
RESULTS: The current study confirmed previous data that high calpain-2 expression is associated with poor overall survival (P = 0.026) and that calpain-1 was not associated with overall survival or progression-free survival. Low expression of calpastatin (P = 0.010) and calpain-4 (P = 0.003) were also associated with adverse survival. Such prognostic associations do not seem to be linked with altered tumour sensitivity towards platinum-based chemotherapy. Interestingly, low calpain-1 expression was more frequent in patients with confined tumours (stage 1) (χ

30448060,Long noncoding RNA LINC00165-induced by STAT3 exerts oncogenic properties via interaction with Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 to promote EMT in gastric cancer.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a crucial member of the non-coding RNA family, and increasing evidence demonstrates that lncRNAs participate in the initiation and progression of cancers. Our study aimed to explore the role of the lncRNA LINC00165 in gastric cancer (GC) development. In the present study, our results showed that LINC00165 was upregulated in GC tissues and cell lines and high expression of LINC00165 was correlated with tumor-node-metastasis stage, invasion depth, and overall survival of GC patients. Functional assays showed that LINC00165 knockdown inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of GC cells and LINC00165 overexpression stimulated their proliferation, migration and invasion. Online transcription factor binding site prediction analysis showed that there were STAT3 binding sites in the LINC00165 promoter region. Furthermore, luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays provided evidence that STAT3 could bind directly to the region between -547 bp to -537 bp (ATGTTGGGAAA) of LINC00165 promoter and activate its transcription. Then GC cells were partitioned into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions and we found that LINC00165 was localized preferentially to the nucleus. Mechanistically, we revealed that LINC00165 functioned as a scaffold for interaction with Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 to promote the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in GC cells. Taken together, our study revealed that LINC00165 was involved in the progression and poor prognosis of GC as an oncogenic role. Therefore, LINC00165 might become a new potential target for GC chemotherapy and further predict prognosis of patients.",Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Intrahepatic dissemination and extrahepatic metastasis are key factors in malignant growth of HCC. Reducing HCC-associated metastasis is critically dependent on uncovering molecular signaling pathways that promote HCC metastasis. In this study, we explored the effect of TGF-β1 and RELN on cell migration, and the relationship between TGF-β1 and RELN in HCC cells. The data presented that TGF-β1 and RELN showed an opposite expression pattern, and either increased expression of TGF-β1 or decreased expression of RELN increased HCC cell migration ability. We also found TGF-β1 enhanced cell migration ability was through repressing RELN expression, as overexpression of RELN impaired TGF-β1 enhanced cell migration.

30447009,Long noncoding RNA MIR31HG is a bona fide prognostic marker with colorectal cancer cell-intrinsic properties.,"Elevated miR-31 expression is associated with poor outcome in colorectal cancer (CRC). Whether the prognostic information is independent of known molecular subgroups and gene expression-based consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) is currently unknown. To investigate this, we analyzed nearly 2000 CRC biopsies and preclinical models. The expression of miR-31-5p and its host transcript, long noncoding RNA MIR31HG, was strongly correlated (Spearman's ρ > 0.80). MIR31HG outlier expression was observed in 158/1265 (12%) of pCRCs and was associated with depletion of CMS2-canonical subgroup (odds ratio = 0.21 [0.11-0.35]) and shorter relapse-free survival (RFS) in multivariable analysis (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.2 [1.6-3.0]). For stage II disease, 5-year RFS for patients with MIR31HG outlier status was 49% compared to 77% for those with normal-like expression. MIR31HG outlier status was associated with inferior outcome also within clinical high risk groups and within the poor prognostic CMS4-mesenchymal gene expression subtype specifically. Preclinical models with MIR31HG outlier expression were characterized by reduced expression of MYC targets as well as elevated epithelial-mesenchymal transition, TNF-α/NFκB, TGF-β, and IFN-α/γ gene expression signatures, indicating cancer cell-intrinsic properties resembling the CMS4 subgroup-associations which were recapitulated in patient biopsies. Moreover, the prognostic value of MIR31HG outlier status was independent of cytotoxic T lymphocyte and fibroblast infiltration. We here present evidence that MIR31HG expression provides clinical stratification beyond major gene expression phenotypes and tumor immune and stromal cell infiltration and propose a model where increased expression is an indicator of a cellular state conferring intrinsic invasive and/or immuno-evasive capabilities.",Int.

30445206,DNp73-induced degradation of tyrosinase links depigmentation with EMT-driven melanoma progression.,"Melanoma is an aggressive cancer with poor prognosis, requiring personalized management of advanced stages and establishment of molecular markers. Melanomas derive from melanocytes, which specifically express tyrosinase, the rate-limiting enzyme of melanin-synthesis. We demonstrate that melanomas with high levels of DNp73, a cancer-specific variant of the p53 family member p73 and driver of melanoma progression show, in contrast to their less-aggressive low-DNp73 counterparts, hypopigmentation in vivo. Mechanistically, reduced melanin-synthesis is mediated by a DNp73-activated IGF1R/PI3K/AKT axis leading to tyrosinase ER-arrest and proteasomal degradation. Tyrosinase loss triggers reactivation of the EMT signaling cascade, a mesenchymal-like cell phenotype and increased invasiveness. DNp73-induced depigmentation, Slug increase and changes in cell motility are recapitulated in neural crest-derived melanophores of Xenopus embryos, underscoring a previously unnoticed physiological role of tyrosinase as EMT inhibitor. This data provides a mechanism of hypopigmentation accompanying cancer progression, which can be exploited in precision diagnosis of patients with melanoma-associated hypopigmentation (MAH), currently seen as a favorable prognostic factor. The DNp73/IGF1R/Slug signature in colorless lesions might aid to clinically discriminate between patients with MAH-associated metastatic disease and those, where MAH is indeed a sign of regression.",Cancer Lett.,2019,"['Fürst K', 'Steder M', 'Logotheti S', 'Angerilli A', 'Spitschak A', 'Marquardt S', 'Schumacher T', 'Engelmann D', 'Herchenröder O', 'Rupp RAW', 'Pützer BM']",

Worldwide, the burden of cancer attributable to obesity, expressed as population attributable fraction, is 11.9% in men and 13.1% in women. There is convincing evidence that excess body weight is associated with an increased risk for cancer of at least 13 anatomic sites, including endometrial, esophageal, renal and pancreatic adenocarcinomas; hepatocellular carcinoma; gastric cardia cancer; meningioma; multiple myeloma; colorectal, postmenopausal breast, ovarian, gallbladder and thyroid cancers. We first synopsize current epidemiologic evidence; the obesity paradox in cancer risk and mortality; the role of weight gain and weight loss in the modulation of cancer risk; reliable somatometric indicators for obesity and cancer research; and gender differences in obesity related cancers. We critically summarize emerging biological mechanisms linking obesity to cancer encompassing insulin resistance and abnormalities of the IGF-I system and signaling; sex hormones biosynthesis and pathway; subclinical chronic low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress; alterations in adipokine pathophysiology; factors deriving from ectopic fat deposition; microenvironment and cellular perturbations including vascular perturbations, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, endoplasmic reticulum stress and migrating adipose progenitor cells; disruption of circadian rhythms; dietary nutrients; factors with potential significance such as the altered intestinal microbiome; and mechanic factors in obesity and cancer.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the impact of N'-[(3Z)-1-(1-hexyl)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-3H-indol-3-ylidene] benzohydrazide (MDA19) on OS and explore its potential mechanism. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) and colony formation assay were employed to evaluate the potential effect of MDA19 on U2OS and MG-63 cells proliferation. Moreover, transwell migration and invasion assay were performed to assess the influence of MDA19 on U2OS and MG-63 cells migration and invasion. In addition, Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide (Annexin V-FITC/PI) staining and flow cytometry were used to examine apoptotic ratio of the U2OS and MG-63 cells. Meanwhile, Western blot analysis was applied to explore change of relevant mechanism proteins in OS cells treated with MDA19. Our study showed that MDA19 had anti-proliferative activity of OS cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, simultaneously, inhibition of colony formation was also observed in U2OS and MG-63 cells after incubation of MDA19. Besides, MDA19 could significantly inhibit the number of migrated and invaded OS cells and markedly increase the OS cells apoptosis rate. Mechanistically, we detected detectable reductions in apoptosis related proteins, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins and activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in U2OS and MG-63 cells exposure to MDA19.

To understand the important roles of P5 in cancer cells, the present study examined its expression on the surface of normal and cancer cell lines by flow cytometry using an affinity‑purified anti‑P5 antibody labeled with 6‑(fluorescein‑5‑carboxamido) hexanoic acid succinimidyl ester. P5 expression was increased on the surface of various cancer cell lines, including leukemia cells, and glioblastoma, breast, colon, ovarian and uterine cervical cancer cells, compared with normal cells. However, P5 was constantly expressed within both normal and cancer cell lysates, and its total expression levels were not significantly different between the cells. P5 knockdown in glioblastoma cells by small interfering RNA affected Bip promoter activation during cancer cell growth, and significantly inhibited cancer cell growth and migration. Immunoprecipitation using an anti‑P5 antibody in cancer and normal cells demonstrated that vimentin was bound to P5, predominantly in U251 glioblastoma cells. P5 knockdown in glioblastoma cells did not affect the protein expression levels of vimentin; however, it did affect the expression of numerous epithelial‑mesenchymal transition markers, including Snail and Slug. These results suggested that P5 may serve an important role in cancer cell growth, and may be considered an attractive and potent target for the treatment of glioblastoma.",Oncol.

However, the expression of PLZF in gastric cancer (GC) has not been reported. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression level and potential status of PLZF in GC as well as its possible mechanism. In the present study, we found that PLZF was downregulated in the majority of GC cell lines and tumor tissues and that alteration of PLZF expression was closely correlated with a malignant phenotype, epithelial‑mesenchymal transformation and overall survival. Evaluation of in vitro proliferation, colony information, migration and invasion indicated that PLZF gene transduction induced a less malignant phenotype, which was also confirmed through in vivo studies performed in athymic nude mice. Furthermore, we assessed the expression levels of the lncRNA ANRIL in GC and found that it was negatively associated with the level of PLZF and that ANRIL indirectly methylated PLZF to suppress its expression via binding with polycomb repressive complex 2. When GC cells were treated with the methylation inhibitor 5‑Aza‑2'‑deoxycytidine, the expression of PLZF increased, which further confirmed that PLZF was methylated. These results indicated that constitutive ANRIL activation was a possible cause of the lack of PLZF expression in GC cells. Coupled deregulation of PLZF and ANRIL may account for most of the alterations described in GC, and PLZF may become a potential target of GC therapy.",Oncol.

30431103,Inhibition of cell proliferation and migration in non‑small cell lung cancer cells through the suppression of LYPLA1.,"Lysophospholipase1 (LYPLA1) also known as acyl‑protein thioesterase1 (APT1) belongs to the superfamily of α/β hydrolase. It has been found to have the properties of a homodimer by manifesting depalmitoylation as well as lysophospholipase activity. LYPLAs are under the control of both microRNAs, miR‑138 and miR‑424. They were observed to be significantly overexpressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. To date, LYPLAs are the sole enzymes recognized to activate depalmitoylation. In this study, we provide the expression pattern of LYPLA1 in non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using four different NSCLC cell lines. Western blot analysis and RT‑PCR were performed to detect the protein expression and mRNA expression of LYPLA1 in NSCLC cell lines. We detected the highest LYPLA1 protein expression level in SPC‑A‑1 cells followed by A549 cells, and the highest LYPLA1 mRNA expression level was detected in the SPC‑A‑1 cells followed by the H1299 cell line. We found that suppression of LYPLA1 expression using small‑interfering RNA significantly inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of the LYPLA1‑transfected NSCLC cells. Furthermore, we explored the involvement of LYPLA1 in the regulation of epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT). The epithelial marker E‑cadherin was significantly increased, while mesenchymal markers N‑cadherin, vimentin and SNAIL were markedly decreased in the LYPLA1‑silenced cells. Collectively the results of the present study suggest that the LYPLA1 gene plays a tumor‑promotor role in NSCLC cells in vitro.",Oncol.

30431099,FOXC1 silencing inhibits the epithelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition of glioma cells: Involvement of β‑catenin signaling.,"Glioma is a type of malignant brain tumor. Forkhead box C1 (FOXC1) is a conserved transcription factor that is involved in tumorigenesis; however, the function of FOXC1 in glioma remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of FOXC1 silencing on the epithelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) of glioma cells. FOXC1‑specific small interfering RNAs were employed to downregulate the expression levels of FOXC1 in glioma cells. The proliferation, migration and invasion of glioma cells were assessed by MTT assay, wound healing assay and Transwell assay. Western blot analysis was performed to reveal the effects of FOXC1 on EMT‑associated proteins and β‑catenin signaling. The results revealed that, following FOXC1 silencing, the proliferation, migration and invasion of glioma cells were decreased. The expression levels of EMT‑associated proteins were also affected. Further examination demonstrated that β‑catenin signaling was involved in the effects of FOXC1 on glioma cells. Previous results suggested that overexpression of β‑catenin reversed the effects of FOXC1 silencing on glioma cells. The present study demonstrated that FOXC1 may regulate the EMT of glioma cells, potentially via β‑catenin signaling. Therefore, FOXC1 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of glioma.",Mol Med Rep,2019,"['Cao Q', 'Wang X', 'Shi Y', 'Zhang M', 'Yang J', 'Dong M', 'Mi Y', 'Zhang Z', 'Liu K', 'Jiang L', 'Wang N', 'Wang P']",
30431069,Long non-coding RNA HOTAIR mediates the switching of histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation to methylation to promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in gastric cancer.,"HOX transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR), a well‑known long non‑coding RNA, plays an important role in the regulation of epithelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition (EMT). In this study, we propose a novel mechanism through which HOTAIR promotes EMT by switching histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation to methylation at the E‑cadherin promoter, which induces the transcriptional inhibition of E‑cadherin. HOTAIR recruits polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to catalyze H3K27me3; however, whether HOTAIR is associated with the acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27, a marker of transcriptional activation, and the mechanisms through which HOTAIR triggers the metastasis of gastric cancer (GC) by epigenetic regulation remain largely unknown. In this study, HOTAIR knockdown significantly reversed EMT by increasing the expression of E‑cadherin in GC cells. Additionally, the loss of PRC2 activity induced by HOTAIR knockdown resulted in a global decrease in H3K27 methylation and an increase in H3K27 acetylation. Furthermore, HOTAIR recruits PRC2 (which consists of H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2, SUZ12 and EED), which may inhibit the reaction between the acetyltransferase CBP and H3K27 acetylation. On the whole, the findings of this study suggested that the HOTAIR‑mediated acetylation to methylation switch was associated with the transcriptional inhibition of E‑cadherin. HOTAIR can promote the development of GC through the epigenetic regulation of E‑cadherin, switching the state of the E‑cadherin promoter from the transcriptionally active to the transcriptionally repressive state.",Int.

In addition to cancer cells, the tumor microenvironment created by a repertoire of resident and recruited cells and the extracellular matrix also contribute to the acquisition of hallmarks of cancer. Among these factors, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are critical components of the tumor microenvironment. CAFs originate from the activation of resident fibroblasts and pancreatic stellate cells, the differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. CAFs acquire an activated phenotype via various cytokines and promote tumor proliferation and growth, accelerate invasion and metastasis, induce angiogenesis, promote inflammation and immune destruction, regulate tumor metabolism, and induce chemoresistance; these factors contribute to the acquisition of major hallmarks of PDAC.

30429478,Colorectal cancer liver metastatic growth depends on PAD4-driven citrullination of the extracellular matrix.,"Citrullination of proteins, a post-translational conversion of arginine residues to citrulline, is recognized in rheumatoid arthritis, but largely undocumented in cancer. Here we show that citrullination of the extracellular matrix by cancer cell derived peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) is essential for the growth of liver metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC). Using proteomics, we demonstrate that liver metastases exhibit higher levels of citrullination and PAD4 than unaffected liver, primary CRC or adjacent colonic mucosa. Functional significance for citrullination in metastatic growth is evident in murine models where inhibition of citrullination substantially reduces liver metastatic burden. Additionally, citrullination of a key matrix component collagen type I promotes greater adhesion and decreased migration of CRC cells along with increased expression of characteristic epithelial markers, suggesting a role for citrullination in promoting mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition and liver metastasis. Overall, our study reveals the potential for PAD4-dependant citrullination to drive the progression of CRC liver metastasis.",Nat Commun,2018,"['Yuzhalin AE', 'Gordon-Weeks AN', 'Tognoli ML', 'Jones K', 'Markelc B', 'Konietzny R', 'Fischer R', 'Muth A', ""O'Neill E"", 'Thompson PR', 'Venables PJ', 'Kessler BM', 'Lim SY', 'Muschel RJ']",
30429463,Restoration of FBP1 suppressed Snail-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1), one of the rate-limiting gluconeogenic enzymes, plays critical roles in several cancers and is treated as a tumour suppressor. However, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unclear. Here, we demonstrated that FBP1 was significantly inhibited during Snail-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tissues in HCC. Restoration of FBP1 expression in HCC cancer cells suppressed EMT phenotype, tumour migration and tumour growth induced by Snail overexpression in SMMC-7721 cells. Gene set enrichment analyses revealed significantly enriched terms, including WNT, Notch, ESC, CSR and PDGF, in the group with high Snail and low FBP1 compared with those with low Snail and high FBP1. Low FBP1 expression was significantly correlated with higher AFP level, satellite nodules, portal vein tumour thrombus, and advanced tumour stage. Survival analyses showed that FBP1 was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival and recurrence-free survival. In conclusion, our study revealed a vital role for FBP1 in Snail-induced EMT and prognostic prediction in HCC.",Cell Death Dis,2018,"['Liu GM', 'Li Q', 'Zhang PF', 'Shen SL', 'Xie WX', 'Chen B', 'Wu J', 'Hu WJ', 'Huang XY', 'Peng BG']",
30428910,Downregulation of CLDN7 due to promoter hypermethylation is associated with human clear cell renal cell carcinoma progression and poor prognosis.,"BACKGROUND: Metastasis is the primary cause of death in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Loss of cell-to-cell adhesion, including tight junctions (TJs) is the initial step in the process of metastasis. Claudin-7 (CLDN7) is a major component of TJs. However, the clinical significance and its regulation of kidney tumorigenesis remain poorly understood.
METHODS: A total of 120 fresh clear cell RCC (ccRCC) specimens and 144 primary RCC and adjacent nonmalignant renal paraffin specimens were obtained from Department of Urology, Peking University First Hospital. Expression of CLDN7 in ccRCC tissues and cell lines were determined using bioinformatic data mining, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blotting and immunostaining. The clinical significance of CLDN7 expression and promoter DNA methylation status was analyzed in ccRCC patients from Peking University First Hospital and The Cancer Genome Atlas. Additionally, the methylation specific-PCR, bisulfite genomic sequencing and demethylation analysis of CLDN7 were performed. Biological functions of CLDN7 were investigated by examining cell proliferation using MTS assays and EdU incorporation assays, cell migration by in vitro wound healing assays and transwell migration assays, cell invasion by transwell invasion assays, and cell apoptosis by flow cytometry. Mouse model experiments were performed to confirm the effects of CLDN7 on tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. The molecular mechanism of CLDN7 function was investigated using gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and high-throughput cDNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and confirmed by qRT-PCR, Western blot and immunostaining in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: Our findings revealed that CLDN7 is frequently downregulated via hypermethylation of its promoter in ccRCC. CLDN7 can help predict aggressive tumor status and poor prognosis in ccRCC patients. Interestingly, hypermethylation of the CLDN7 promoter was related to advanced ccRCC status and poor prognosis. Moreover, overexpression of CLDN7 induced cell apoptosis, suppressed proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of ccRCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, GSEA and RNA-Seq results showed that CLDN7 had negative effects in cancer-associated signaling pathways and (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) EMT-related pathways. These results were validated by qRT-PCR, Western blot and immunostaining.
CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated a previously undescribed role of CLDN7 as a ccRCC suppressor and suggest that loss of CLDN7 potentiates EMT and tumor progression. CLDN7 may serve as a functional tumor suppressor in tumor progression and a potential biomarker and target in patients with ccRCC.",J. Exp. Clin.

30428352,The Dynamics of TGF-β Signaling Are Dictated by Receptor Trafficking via the ESCRT Machinery.,"Signal transduction pathways stimulated by secreted growth factors are tightly regulated at multiple levels between the cell surface and the nucleus. The trafficking of cell surface receptors is emerging as a key step for regulating appropriate cellular responses, with perturbations in this process contributing to human diseases, including cancer. For receptors recognizing ligands of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) family, little is known about how trafficking is regulated or how this shapes signaling dynamics. Here, using whole genome small interfering RNA (siRNA) screens, we have identified the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) machinery as a crucial determinant of signal duration. Downregulation of ESCRT components increases the outputs of TGF-β signaling and sensitizes cells to low doses of ligand in their microenvironment. This sensitization drives an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in response to low doses of ligand, and we demonstrate a link between downregulation of the ESCRT machinery and cancer survival.",Cell Rep,2018,"['Miller DSJ', 'Bloxham RD', 'Jiang M', 'Gori I', 'Saunders RE', 'Das D', 'Chakravarty P', 'Howell M', 'Hill CS']",
30424954,LDR-Induced miR-30a and miR-30b Target the PAI-1 Pathway to Control Adverse Effects of NSCLC Radiotherapy.,"Radiotherapy has been a central part in curing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, it is possible that not all of the tumor cells are destroyed by radiation; therefore, it is important to effectively control residual tumor cells that could become aggressive and resistant to radiotherapy. In this study, we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism of decreased NSCLC radioresistance by low-dose radiation (LDR) pretreatment. The results indicated that miR-30a and miR-30b, which effectively inhibited plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), were overexpressed by treatment of LDR to NSCLC cells. Phosphorylation of Akt and ERK, the downstream survival signals of PAI-1, was decreased by PAI-1 inhibition. Reduced cell survival and epithelial-mesenchymal transition by PAI-1 inhibition were confirmed in NSCLC cells. Moreover, in vivo orthotopic xenograft mouse models with 7C1 nanoparticles to deliver miRNAs showed that tumor growth and aggressiveness were efficiently decreased by LDR treatment followed by radiotherapy. Taken together, the present study suggested that PAI-1, whose expression is regulated by LDR, was critical for controlling surviving tumor cells after radiotherapy.",Mol.

30423905,Hypoxic Microenvironment and Metastatic Bone Disease.,"Hypoxia is a common feature of solid tumors and is associated with an increased risk of metastasis and a poor prognosis. Recent imaging techniques revealed that bone marrow contains a quite hypoxic microenvironment. Low oxygen levels activate hypoxia signaling pathways such as hypoxia-inducible factors, which play critical roles in the key stages of metastatic dissemination including angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, maintenance of cancer stem cells, tumor cell dormancy, release of extracellular vesicles, and generation of pre-metastatic niches. Hypoxia also affects bone cells, such as osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and immune cells, which also act to support the development and progression of bone metastases. Paradoxically, hypoxia and related signaling molecules are recognized as high-priority therapeutic targets and many candidate drugs are currently under preclinical and clinical investigation. The present review focuses on our current knowledge of the potential roles of hypoxia in cancer metastasis to bone by considering the interaction between metastatic cancer cells and the bone microenvironment. Current therapeutic approaches targeting hypoxia are also described.",Int J Mol Sci,2018,['Hiraga T'],
30420101,miR-218 inhibits gastric tumorigenesis through regulating Bmi-1/Akt signaling pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies indicated that miR-218 was deregulated in gastric cancer patients and correlated with tumor invasion and prognosis. The aim of this study was to clarify the effect of miR-218 on the malignant behavior of gastric cancer and its role in regulating Bmi-1/Akt signaling pathway.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used miR-218 mimic to transfect gastric cancer cell lines AGS and SGC-7901, and the overexpression efficiency was validated using qRT-PCR assay. MTT assay and Transwell chamber system were performed to detect the effect of miR-218 on cell proliferation, invasion and migration on gastric cancer. Western blot and qRT-PCR assay was used to test the role of miR-218 in regulating Bmi-1/Akt signaling pathway.
RESULTS: As shown in our research, ectopic expression of miR-218 in gastric cancer cells inhibits the proliferation, invasion and migration of gastric cancer cells. In addition, miR-218 re-expression inhibits the expression of Bmi-1 and its downstream target p-Akt

30419948,Long non-coding RNA DANCR promotes malignant phenotypes of bladder cancer cells by modulating the miR-149/MSI2 axis as a ceRNA.,"BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidences have indicated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are potential biomarkers that play key roles in tumor development and progression. Differentiation antagonizing non-protein noding RNA (DANCR) is a novel lncRNA that acts as a potential biomarker and is involved in the development of cancers. However, the clinical significance and molecular mechanism of DANCR in bladder cancer is still unknown.
METHODS: The relative expression level of DANCR was determined by Real-Time qPCR in a total of 106 patients with urothelial bladder cancer and in different bladder cancer cell lines. Loss-of-function experiments were performed to investigate the biological roles of DANCR on bladder cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tumorigenicity. Comprehensive transcriptional analysis, RNA-FISH, dual-luciferase reporter assay and western blot were performed to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of DANCR.
RESULTS: In this study, we found that DANCR was significantly up-regulated in bladder cancer. Moreover, increased DANCR expression was positively correlated with higher histological grade and advanced TNM stage. Further experiments demonstrated that knockdown of DANCR inhibited malignant phenotypes and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of bladder cancer cells. Mechanistically, we found that DANCR was distributed mostly in the cytoplasm and DANCR functioned as a miRNA sponge to positively regulate the expression of musashi RNA binding protein 2 (MSI2) through sponging miR-149 and subsequently promoted malignant phenotypes of bladder cancer cells, thus playing an oncogenic role in bladder cancer pathogenesis.
CONCLUSION: This study is the first to demonstrate that DANCR plays a critical regulatory role in bladder cancer cell and DANCR may serve as a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target of bladder cancer.",J.

30419872,Stromal fibroblast activation protein alpha promotes gastric cancer progression via epithelial-mesenchymal transition through Wnt/ β-catenin pathway.,"BACKGROUND: To investigate the influence of fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP) derived from cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), as well as potential mechanism of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), on gastric cancer (GC) progression.
METHODS: Correlation between CAFs-derived FAP and clinical results has been studied by using 60 GC cases. To confirm this relationship, SGC7901 cells were co-cultured with pre-established FAP-overexpressed fibroblasts in vitro and the characteristics including proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis abilities were detected subsequently. Meanwhile, SGC and GES1 cells cocultured with FAP-overexpressed fibroblasts were treated with cis-platinum for apoptotic analysis. The underlying EMT was detected by analyzing expression level of E-cadherin, ZO-1, N-cadherin, Vimentin, α-SMA, DKK1 and LEF-1 through western blot and immunofluorescence staining assay. Finally, the tumor-promoting ability of FAP was investigated by utlizing a xenograft gastric cancer nude mouse model.
RESULTS: It show that FAP has a high-risk correlation with the malignant level of clinical outcomes in GC patients. FAP promotes the ability of proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis-inhibition of SGC7901 cells and induces apoptosis of GES1 cells in vitro. The mechanism study shows that epithelial markers have been down-regulated and mesenchymal markers and Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway related proteins have been up-regulated. Animal assay suggests that tumor burden has been enhanced by FAP significantly in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: Stromal FAP could be a potential prognostic biomarker in GC by promoting cancer progression via EMT through Wnt/ β-catenin signal pathway.",BMC Cancer,2018,"['Liu J', 'Huang C', 'Peng C', 'Xu F', 'Li Y', 'Yutaka Y', 'Xiong B', 'Yang X']",
30416386,TGF-β/SMAD4-Regulated LncRNA-LINP1 Inhibits Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Lung Cancer.,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related deaths worldwide. TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key cell-intrinsic identity for tumor cell migration, invasion, and stemness acquisition in cancer metastasis. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have not been fully investigated for their involvement in regulating TGF-β-induced EMT and metastasis in lung cancer. Here, we demonstrated that the transcription of lncRNA in nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway 1 (LINP1) was inhibited by TGF-β1 in a SMAD4-dependent manner. LINP1 suppressed EMT of lung cancer cells, thereby controlling cancer cell migration, invasion, and stemless. Moreover, LINP1 inhibited TGF-β-induced EMT and cell invasion in lung cancer cells.

30415774,Bovine lactoferrin reverses programming of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition to mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition in oral squamous cell carcinoma.,"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a biological process of invasion and metastasis in cancers, including in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). However, an effective anticancer drug that directly targets EMT has not yet been discovered. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the repressive effects of bovine lactoferrin (bLF) on EMT to achieve mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) in OSCC. OSCC cell lines, HOC313 (EMT-induced) and SCCVII (without EMT induction), were treated with bLF. The effects of bLF on EMT in OSCC were identified histologically by haematoxylin and eosin staining and observed morphologically and immunohistochemically using an anti-E-cadherin antibody. Expression levels of E-cadherin and vimentin were investigated using RT-PCR and western blotting. Immuno-expression of E-cadherin was examined in vivo in tumour tissues of C3H/HeN mice, transplanted with SCCVII cells, with or without bLF administration. We found that bLF changed the spindle-like mesenchymal cells to cuboidal-like epithelial cells and enhanced the affinity of membrane-bound E-cadherin in HOC313 cells. The transformation of EMT-MET in HOC313 cells was confirmed by the upregulation of E-cadherin and suppression of vimentin. Moreover, bLF suppressed TWIST expression through downregulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Additionally, the inhibition tumour cell infiltration and increase in E-cadherin expression were observed in xenografts of the mice orally administered with bLF. Thus, based on the results from in vitro and in vivo studies, we concluded that bLF caused the restoration of epithelial properties through MET. Importantly, this finding is novel and is the first report indicating that bLF inhibited EMT and induced MET in OSCC, suggesting that bLF may provide a novel therapeutic strategy in OSCC.",Biochem.

30415263,HOXA-AS2 Promotes Proliferation and Induces Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition via the miR-520c-3p/GPC3 Axis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Previous studies have demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) may play critical roles in cancer biology, including Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The HOXA cluster antisense RNA2 (HOXA-AS2) lncRNA plays an important role in carcinogenesis, however, the underlying role of HOXA-AS2 in HCC remains unknown. The present study examined the effects of HOXA-AS2 on the progression of HCC, and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms.
METHODS: Quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect HOXA-AS2 expression in HCC tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, the effects of HOXA-AS2 silencing and overexpression on cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were assessed in HCC in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, bioinformatics online programs predicted and luciferase reporter assay were used to validate the association of HOXA-AS2 and miR-520c-3p in HCC cells.
RESULTS: We observed that HOXA-AS2 was up-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. In vitro experiments revealed that HOXA-AS2 knockdown significantly inhibited HCC cells proliferation by causing G1 arrest and promoting apoptosis, whereas HOXA-AS2 overexpression promoted cell growth. Further functional assays indicated that HOXA-AS2 significantly promoted HCC cell migration and invasion by promoting EMT. Bioinformatics online programs predicted that HOXA-AS2 sponge miR-520c-3p at 3'-UTR with complementary binding sites, which was validated using luciferase reporter assay. HOXA-AS2 could negatively regulate the expression of miR-520c-3p in HCC cells. MiR-520c-3p was down-regulated and inversely correlated with HOXA-AS2 expression in HCC tissues. miR-520c-3p suppressed cell proliferation, invasion and migration in HCC cells, and enforced expression of miR-520c-3p attenuated the oncogenic effects of HOXA-AS2 in HCC cells. By bioinformatic analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assay, we found that miR-223-3p directly targeted the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of Glypican-3 (GPC3), one of the key players in HCC. GPC3 was up-regulated in HCC tissues, and was negatively correlated with miR-520c-3p expression and positively correlated with HOXA-AS2 expression.
CONCLUSION: In summary, our results suggested that the HOXA-AS2/miR-520c-3p/GPC3 axis may play an important role in the regulation of PTC progression, which could serve as a biomarker and therapeutic target for HCC.",Cell.

30414187,Glioblastoma endothelium drives bevacizumab-induced infiltrative growth via modulation of PLXDC1.,"Bevacizumab, a VEGF-targeting monoclonal antibody, may trigger an infiltrative growth pattern in glioblastoma. We investigated this pattern using both a human specimen and rat models. In the human specimen, a substantial fraction of infiltrating tumor cells were located along perivascular spaces in close relationship with endothelial cells. Brain xenografts of U87MG cells treated with bevacizumab were smaller than controls (p = 0.0055; Student t-test), however, bands of tumor cells spread through the brain farther than controls (p < 0.001; Student t-test). Infiltrating tumor Cells exhibited tropism for vascular structures and propensity to form tubules and niches with endothelial cells. Molecularly, bevacizumab triggered an epithelial to mesenchymal transition with over-expression of the receptor Plexin Domain Containing 1 (PLXDC1). These results were validated using brain xenografts of patient-derived glioma stem-like cells. Enforced expression of PLXDC1 in U87MG cells promoted brain infiltration along perivascular spaces. Importantly, PLXDC1 inhibition prevented perivascular infiltration and significantly increased the survival of bevacizumab-treated rats. Our study indicates that bevacizumab-induced brain infiltration is driven by vascular endothelium and depends on PLXDC1 activation of tumor cells.",Int. J.

30411685,Role of HIF-1 in Cancer Progression: Novel Insights. A Review.,"Hypoxia is a condition always present in tumor environment owing to the fast growth of tumor cells not supported by adequate blood supply. There is increasing evidence that hypoxia plays an important role in cancer dormancy and cancer metabolism, increasing stemness activity and bringing about cancer initiation and progression. This condition may influence the production of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) a helix transcription factor which is involved in carcinogenesis and tumor growth through the regulation of genes involved in angiogenesis, glycolytic metabolism and other biological mechanisms. In normoxia condition HIF is inactivated by prolyl hydroxylase enzymes (EGLN 1-3, also known as PHD 1-3) using oxygen as a substrate. Once hydroxilated it binds to a protein called Von Hippel Lindau protein (VHL) for its degradation, whereas in hypoxia condition stabilization and nuclear translocation occur, leading to oncogenes activation. It has got three isoforms HIF-1 HIF-2 and HIF-3. The most studied factor is HIF-1 which is a heterodimer consisting of two forms, the form α is expressed in manner oxygen dependent, the form β is expressed constitutively. Its presence in tumor microenvironment could foster among other the expression of VEGF, HGF, Met protoncogene which induces degradation of the extracellular matrix and TWIST gene, which is in turn involved in a mechanism of cancer cell metastasis called epithelial-mesenchimal transition(EMT). In this review, we summarize the most important findings in HIF action in different types of cancer focusing on its properties to induce tumor cell growth and highlighting its poor prognostic value in different cancers sites.",Curr.

30409452,Ultrastructural immunolocalization of telomerase and hyaluronate in migrating keratinocytes in a case of oro-pharyngeal squamous cancer.,"The ultrastructural immunolocalization of telomerase and hyaluronate has been studied in a case of oropharyngeal squamous carcinoma. Immunofluorescence shows that telomerase immunolabeling is present in the cytoplasm and in nuclei of some keratinocytes during their migration into the underlying connective tissue. The electron microscope shows that the nuclear localization of telomerase mainly occurs in the large nucleoli and in likely Cajal bodies, the sites of assembling and maturation of proteins forming the telomerase complex. Aside ribosomes, the nucleolus has a role in the biosynthesis of this reverse transcriptase during cell proliferation in normal tissues and in tumors. The cytoplasmic labeling for telomerase is frequently associated with an irregular network of keratin bundles but the significance of this observation is unclear. Hyaluronate, detected through ultrastructural immunolocalization of a hyaluronate binding protein, is abundant mostly along the cell membrane of the detaching basal keratinocytes during epithelial mesenchymal transition. A coat of hyaluronate surrounds the free keratinocytes of the squamous epithelium and is present around the connective cells present underneath. The study supports the hypothesis that hyaluronate forms a pathway along which epithelial cells can migrate during epidermal mesenchymal transition and may also shield cancer cells from immune cells.",Pathol.

30409309,Carcinogenic epithelial-mesenchymal transition initiated by oral cancer exosomes is inhibited by anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab.,"Overexpression and increased signaling from the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) often changes oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and thus EGFR is frequently targeted molecularly by the therapeutic antibody cetuximab. We assessed the roles of OSCC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes in the trafficking of cetuximab and in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of epithelial cells. OSCC cells abundantly expressed EGFR, which was secreted from cells with OSCC-EVs upon EGF stimulations. The OSCC-EGFR-EVs were then able to enter into and transform epithelial cells leading to increased mesenchymal traits with increased vimentin and spindle-like shapes. EGF priming of OSCC cells further increased this EMT-initiating effect of the OSCC-EVs. The internalization and pro-EMT effects of the OSCC-EVs were largely blocked by cetuximab. Thus, OSCC-derived EVs transform normal epithelial cells into a mesenchymal phenotype and anti-EGFR therapeutic antibody cetuximab inhibits such a carcinogenic effect of the OSCC-EVs.",Oral Oncol.,2018,"['Fujiwara T', 'Eguchi T', 'Sogawa C', 'Ono K', 'Murakami J', 'Ibaragi S', 'Asaumi JI', 'Calderwood SK', 'Okamoto K', 'Kozaki KI']",

However, its expression and clinical significance in gastric cancer (GC) have not been well documented. In the present study, we detected the expression of EphB3 in GC and adjacent noncancerous tissues and explored its relationships with the clinicopathological features and prognosis of GC patients. It was found that EphB3 silenced GC cells epigenetically by direct transcriptional repression of GC cells via polycomb group protein EZH2 mediation. EphB3 was downregulated in GC cells and tissues, and EphB3 depletion promoted GC cell growth and invasion, while ectopic overexpression of EphB3 produced a significant anti-tumor effect. EphB3 was found to be involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition by regulating E-cadherin and vimentin expression. In addition, patients with reduced EphB3 expression had shorter disease-free survival (DFS), indicating that EphB3 may prove to be a biomarker for prognosis of GC.

30405106,Genetic dissection of the miR-200-Zeb1 axis reveals its importance in tumor differentiation and invasion.,"The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important mechanism for cancer progression and metastasis. Numerous in vitro and tumor-profiling studies point to the miR-200-Zeb1 axis as crucial in regulating this process, yet in vivo studies involving its regulation within a physiological context are lacking. Here, we show that miR-200 ablation in the Rip-Tag2 insulinoma mouse model induces beta-cell dedifferentiation, initiates an EMT expression program, and promotes tumor invasion. Strikingly, disrupting the miR-200 sites of the endogenous Zeb1 locus causes a similar phenotype. Reexpressing members of the miR-200 superfamily in vitro reveals that the miR-200c family and not the co-expressed and closely related miR-141 family is responsible for regulation of Zeb1 and EMT. Our results thus show that disrupting the in vivo regulation of Zeb1 by miR-200c is sufficient to drive EMT, thus highlighting the importance of this axis in tumor progression and invasion and its potential as a therapeutic target.",Nat Commun,2018,"['Title AC', 'Hong SJ', 'Pires ND', 'Hasenöhrl L', 'Godbersen S', 'Stokar-Regenscheit N', 'Bartel DP', 'Stoffel M']",
30404206,Signaling Pathways Induced by Leptin during Epithelial⁻Mesenchymal Transition in Breast Cancer.,"Leptin is an adipokine that is overexpressed in obese and overweight people. Interestingly, women with breast cancer present high levels of leptin and of its receptor ObR. Leptin plays an important role in breast cancer progression due to the biological processes it participates in, such as epithelial⁻mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT consists of a series of orchestrated events in which cell⁻cell and cell⁻extracellular matrix interactions are altered and lead to the release of epithelial cells from the surrounding tissue. The cytoskeleton is also re-arranged, allowing the three-dimensional movement of epithelial cells into the extracellular matrix. This transition provides cells with the ability to migrate and invade adjacent or distal tissues, which is a classic feature of invasive or metastatic carcinoma cells. In recent years, the number of cases of breast cancer has increased, making this disease a public health problem worldwide and the leading cause of death due to cancer in women.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following 24 hours of culture of SGC-7901 cells in presence of TGF-β1, we observed the changes in morphology as well as mRNA and protein expressions of GLI-1, E-cadherin and Vimentin by RT-PCR and Western blot. Transwell assay was conducted to evaluate the changes in invasion ability of SGC-7901 cells. Then, SGC-7901 cells were co-treated with TGF-β1 and GANT 61, and changes of the above indexes were also detected using the corresponding methods.
RESULTS: In presence of TGF-β1, EMT was initiated in SGC-7901 cells EMT with increased cell invasion ability, and the mRNA and protein expressions of E-cadherin were downregulated, while those of the GLI-1 and Vimentin were upregulated. Conversely, the co-treatment of TGF-β1 and GANT 61 suppressed the increased cell invasion ability induced only by TGF-β1, and the changes in mRNA and protein expressions of these factors were abolished.

The aim of the study is to investigate the clinical role and biological effects of long non-coding RNA EWSAT1 in CRC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression of lncRNA EWSAT1 was detected in 106 cases of fresh CRC tissues and matched adjacent normal tissues by qRT-PCR analyses. The Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test were used to assess the association between lncRNA EWSAT1 expression and overall survival (OS) rate of CRC patients. Cell proliferation and invasion capacity were evaluated by CCK8 assay, colony formation, and transwell invasion assays. The protein expression was detected using western blot analysis.
RESULTS: LncRNA EWSAT1 expression was abnormally higher in CRC tissues compared to matched adjacent normal tissues. Higher lncRNA EWSAT1 expression significantly associated with depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, and advanced tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage in CRC patients. Patients with higher EWSAT1 expression exhibited shorter OS compared with patients with lower EWSAT1 expression. Furthermore, lncRNA EWSAT1 knockdown significantly suppressed cell proliferation and invasion in CRC. In addition, lncRNA EWSAT1 knockdown suppressed cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through reducing Snail1, Snail2, and N-cadherin expression, but increasing E-cadherin expression in CRC cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Downregulation of lncRNA EWSAT1 suppressed cell proliferation and invasion of CRC, which indicated that EWSAT1 may be a potential target of CRC treatment.",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,2018,"['Zhang R', 'Li JB', 'Yan XF', 'Jin K', 'Li WY', 'Xu J', 'Zhao J', 'Bai JH', 'Chen YZ']",
30402835,Effect of hypoxia on the Twist1 in EMT of cervical cancer cells.,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of hypoxia on the Twist1 expression in epithelial-mesenchymal transition of the cervical cancer cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we simulated the normoxia and hypoxia environment, where HeLa cells were cultured, respectively. Cell invasion ability was measured by the transwell assay, while the GLI-1 protein and mRNA expressions were measured by Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot assays. After that, HeLa cells were transfected with the GLI-1-specific siRNA, followed by the measurement of mRNA and protein expressions using RT-PCR and Western blot assays, as well as the cell invasion ability by the transwell assay.
RESULTS: We found that in hypoxic environment, GLI-1 was up-regulated in HeLa cells, with enhanced invasion ability. However, silencing the expression of GLI-1 could reverse the up-regulation of GLI-1 compromising the invasion ability of HeLa cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxia may account for the increased invasion of HeLa cells, which is realized by the up-regulated GLI-1.",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,2018,"['Wang XH', 'He X', 'Jin HY', 'Liang JX', 'Li N']",

30400797,Periostin involved in the activated hepatic stellate cells-induced progression of residual hepatocellular carcinoma after sublethal heat treatment: its role and potential for therapeutic inhibition.,"BACKGROUND: Incomplete thermal ablation may induce invasiveness of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we investigated whether activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) would accelerate the progression of residual HCC after sublethal heat treatment, and thus sought to identify the potential targets.
METHODS: Hepatocellular carcinoma cells were exposed to sublethal heat treatment and then cultured with the conditioned medium from activated HSCs (HSC-CM). The cell proliferation, migration, invasion and parameters of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were analyzed. In vivo tumor progression of heat-treated residual HCC cells inoculated with activated HSCs was studied in nude mice.
RESULTS: HSC-CM significantly enhanced the proliferation, motility, invasion, prominent EMT activation and decreased apoptosis of heat-exposed residual HCC cells. These increased malignant phenotypes were markedly attenuated by neutralizing periostin (POSTN) in HSC-CM. Furthermore, exogenous POSTN administration exerted the similar effects of HSC-CM on heat-treated residual HCC cells. POSTN induced the prominent activation of p52Shc and ERK1/2 via integrin β1 in heat-exposed residual HCC cells. Vitamin D analog calcipotriol blocked POSTN secretion from activated HSCs. Calcipotriol plus cisplatin significantly suppressed the activated HSCs-enhanced tumor progression of heat-treated residual HCC cells via the inhibited POSTN expression and the increased apoptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Activated HSCs promote the tumor progression of heat-treated residual HCC through the release of POSTN, which could be inhibited by calcipotriol. Calcipotriol plus cisplatin could be used to thwart the accelerated progression of residual HCC after suboptimal heat treatment.",J Transl Med,2018,"['Zhang R', 'Lin XH', 'Ma M', 'Chen J', 'Chen J', 'Gao DM', 'Cui JF', 'Chen RX']",
30399372,Diacylglycerol kinase γ predicts prognosis and functions as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating glucose transporter 1 in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Diacylglycerol kinases (DGK) are a family of enzymes catalyzing the transformation of diacylglycerol into phosphatidic acid, which have been recognized as key regulators in cell signaling pathways. The role of DGKγ in human malignancies has seldom been studied. In this study, we investigated the role of DGKγ in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We found that DGKγ was down-regulated in HCC tumor tissues and cell lines as compared to that in non-tumor tissues. The prognostic value of DGKγ expression was evaluated by Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses. Lower DGKγ expression in tumor tissues was an independent prognostic factor for poor post-surgical overall survival. By using HDACs inhibitors treatment and ChIP-PCR, we discovered that histone H3 and H4 deacetylation mainly contributed to the downregulation of DGKγ expression. Functional studies revealed that ectopic expression of DGKγ inhibited cell proliferation and cell migration in HCC cells. Mechanism studies showed that DGKγ overexpression led to down regulation of GLUT1 protein level and AMPK activity, which result in glucose uptake suppression as well as lactate and ATP production declination. The decrease of GLUT1 level could be partially rescued by treatments with either DGK inhibitor and lysosome inhibitor, indicating DGKγ may down-regulate GLUT1 through its kinase activity and lysosome degradation process. Together, this study demonstrated that DGKγ plays a tumor suppressor role in HCC by negatively regulating GLUT1. DGKγ could be a novel prognostic indicator and therapeutic target for HCC.",Exp.

To provide further mechanistic insights, we developed a drug surrogate that phenocopies metformin and can be labeled in situ by means of click chemistry. Firstly, we found this molecule to be more potent than metformin in several cancer cell models. Secondly, this technology enabled us to provide visual evidence of mitochondrial targeting with this class of drugs. A combination of fluorescence microscopy and cyclic voltammetry indicated that metformin targets mitochondrial copper, inducing the production of reactive oxygen species in this organelle, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. Importantly, this study revealed that mitochondrial copper is required for the maintenance of a mesenchymal state of human cancer cells, and that metformin can block the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a biological process that normally accounts for the genesis of persister cancer cells, through direct copper targeting.",PLoS ONE,2018,"['Müller S', 'Versini A', 'Sindikubwabo F', 'Belthier G', 'Niyomchon S', 'Pannequin J', 'Grimaud L', 'Cañeque T', 'Rodriguez R']",

Therefore, it is of utmost importance to delineate the effects of senescence inducers on the various types of cells that compose the different organs. We show here that primary normal breast luminal (NBL) cells are more sensitive than their corresponding stromal fibroblasts to proliferative as well as oxidative damage-induced senescence. Like fibroblasts, senescent NBL cells secreted elevated amounts of various cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8, and expressed high levels of p16, p21, and p53, while lamin B1 was downregulated. When senescent, luminal cells activated stromal fibroblasts in an IL-8-dependent manner, through the activation of the STAT3 pathway.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: TPC-1 and SW1736 thyroid carcinoma cells were used. Cell viability, cytotoxic activity, apoptosis and migration were examined by applying appropriate methods. Drug combination analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Evodiamine treatment of cells decreased cell viability, and Bcl2 and phospho-AKT protein levels. Cytotoxic activity and the percentage of apoptotic cells increased. After co-treatment of wortmannin, cell viability, and phospho-AKT and Bcl2 protein levels decreased, and cytotoxic activity increased. In transforming growth factor-β-treated cells, evodiamine attenuated variations in morphology, growth and migration, and increased p21 and p53 protein levels, and decreased β-catenin, N-cadherin, vimentin, phospho-AKT, matrix metalloproteinase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 protein levels. When cells were treated with both evodiamine and chemotherapeutic agents, all combination index values were lower than 1.0.

This study aimed to assess the effects of HIF1α on the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumorigenesis of lung adenocarcinoma cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Invasion, migration and colony formation assays were used to evaluate cell transformation. Expression of EMT-related markers were analyzed by western blot, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction or zymography. A luciferase assay was carried out to access the transcriptional activity of β-catenin.
RESULTS: Hypoxia enhanced migration, invasion and transformation of A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells. Hypoxic stimulation promoted the expression of EMT-related markers in lung cancer cells. The expression of HIF1α was found to be involved in hypoxia-mediated modulation of expression of snail family transcriptional repressors 1 (SNAI1) and 2 (SLUG).

METHODS: Here, the effects of salidroside (Sal) combined with platinum drugs on human hepatocellular carcinoma were examined in vitro and in vivo. We investigated the antitumor effects of Sal by inhibiting the drug resistance and explained its mechanism in inhibiting tumor growth.
FINDINGS: The results showed that Sal co-administration reverses the drug resistance of platinum drugs and suppressed metastasis induced by the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Sal promoted the degradation of HIF-1α. In conclusion, Sal significantly increased the sensitivity to platinum drugs and inhibited hypoxia-induced EMT in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through inhibiting HIF-1α signaling pathway.

30396168,Secreted Frizzled Related Protein 2 Modulates Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and Stemness via Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling in Choriocarcinoma.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Choriocarcinoma (CC) is a highly aggressive gestational trophoblastic neoplasia; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms of its invasiveness and metastasis remain poorly understood. Human secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2) could function as a tumor promoter or suppressor in different tumors, yet the role it plays in CC's invasion and metastasis is thoroughly unclear. The current study was aimed to explore the function and underlying mechanism of SFRP2 in CC.
METHODS: The expression of SFRP2 in CC tissues was examined via immunohistochemistry. The methylation level and expression of SFRP2 in CC cell lines, JEG-3 and JAR were examined via bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP), western blotting and quantitative RT-PCR. The biological role of increasing expressed SFRP2 through its promoter demethylation with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) was examined by a series of in vitro functional studies. Furthermore, lentivirus transfection technology was adopted to investigate the biological roles of SFRP2 knockdown in JEG-3 and JAR cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, its downstream signaling pathway was investigated.
RESULTS: SFRP2 was downregulated in CC tissues, and its expression was inversely related to its promoter hypermethylation frequency in JEG-3 and JAR cells. Increased SFRP2 through its promoter demethylation inhibited cell migration, invasion and colony formation in JEG-3 and JAR cells, whereas decreased SFRP2 reversed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process and stemness in JEG-3 and JAR cells both in vitro and vivo. Mechanistically, SFRP2 regulated the EMT and stemness of CC cell lines via canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling, validated by the usage of a Wnt activator and inhibitor.
CONCLUSION: The current study indicates that downregulated SFRP2 has potent tumor-promotive effects in CC through the modulation of cancer stemness and the EMT phenotype via activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in vitro and in vivo.",Cell.

30393159,"Loss of TMEM126A promotes extracellular matrix remodeling, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and breast cancer metastasis by regulating mitochondrial retrograde signaling.","TMEM126A is a mitochondrial transmembrane protein, and its functions in breast cancer progression remain unclear. In this study, via the iTRAQ assay using primary and metastatic breast cancer cell models, we found that TMEM126A expression decreased in metastatic cells. We further confirmed that low TMEM126A expression correlated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in patients. The downregulation of TMEM126A in breast cancer cell lines significantly enhanced the metastatic properties in vitro and in vivo, whereas its overexpression decreased the metastatic potential of cell lines. Mechanistic studies based on RNA-sequencing indicated that TMEM126A might regulate cell metastasis via ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesions, and actin cytoskeleton, among other processes. Furthermore, the loss of TMEM126A activated extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and promoted epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, TMEM126A silencing induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization. The ROS scavengers reversed ECM remodeling and EMT mediated by TMEM126A. Collectively, our findings show that the loss of TMEM126A induces mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequently metastasis by activating ECM remodeling and EMT. These findings suggest that TMEM126A is a novel suppressor of metastasis and that it can be a potential prognostic indicator for patients with breast cancer.",Cancer Lett.,2019,"['Sun HF', 'Yang XL', 'Zhao Y', 'Tian Q', 'Chen MT', 'Zhao YY', 'Jin W']",

The association between transforming growth factor TGFα and human cancer incidence has been suggested, yet, the regulatory roles of TGFα and the molecular mechanisms remain unknown, especially in colon cancer. We aim to investigate the functional regulations of TGFα in colon cancer progression. Two colon cancer cell lines were applied, and plasmid overexpression and siRNA-mediated depletion techniques were used to verify the role of TGFα in colon cancer. Cell proliferation was analyzed by MTS assay and colony formation assay, and western blot assay was used to examine protein expression. Migration, invasion, and reporter assays were also carried out to study the regulations of TGFα in colon cancer. Our results evidenced that expression of TGFα facilitates short-term and long-term proliferations of colon cancer cells. Moreover, TGFα was suggested as a migration-and-invasion promoting factor of colon cancer. Finally, our data indicated that TGFα modulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and NFκB signaling pathway in colon cancer cells.

Here, we demonstrate that glioma stem cells (GSC) induce EndMT in brain endothelial cells (BEC). TGF-β signaling is necessary, but not sufficient to induce this EndMT process. Cell-to-cell contact and the contribution of Notch signaling are also required. NEO212, a conjugate of temozolomide and perillyl alcohol, blocks EndMT induction and reverts the mesenchymal phenotype of tumor-associated BEC (TuBEC) by blocking TGF-β and Notch pathways. Consequently, NEO212 reduces the invasiveness and pro-angiogenic properties associated with TuBEC, without affecting control BEC. Intracranial co-implantation of BEC and GSC in athymic mice showed that EndMT occurs in vivo, and can be blocked by NEO212, supporting the potential clinical value of NEO212 for the treatment of GBM.",Cancer Lett.,2019,"['Marín-Ramos NI', 'Jhaveri N', 'Thein TZ', 'Fayngor RA', 'Chen TC', 'Hofman FM']",

30391782,Cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-derived IL32 promotes breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis via integrin β3-p38 MAPK signalling.,"Metastasis is the leading cause of breast cancer-related deaths. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the predominant stromal cell type in the breast tumour microenvironment, may contribute to cancer progression through interaction with tumour cells. Nonetheless, little is known about the details of the underlying mechanism. Here we found that interaction of interleukin 32 (IL32) with integrin β3 (encoded by ITGB3; a member of the integrin family) mediating the cross-talk between CAFs and breast cancer cells plays a crucial role in CAF-induced breast tumour invasiveness. IL32, an 'RGD' motif-containing cytokine, was found to be abundantly expressed in CAFs. Integrin β3 turned out to be up-regulated in breast cancer cells during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). CAF-derived IL32 specifically bound to integrin β3 through the RGD motif, thus activating intracellular downstream p38 MAPK signalling in breast cancer cells. This signalling increased the expression of EMT markers (fibronectin, N-cadherin, and vimentin) and promoted tumour cell invasion. Counteracting IL32 activity, a knockdown of IL32 or integrin β3 led to specific inactivation of p38 MAPK signalling in tumour cells. Blockage of the p38 MAPK pathway also diminished IL32-induced expression of EMT markers and breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Thus, our data indicate that CAF-secreted IL32 promotes breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis via integrin β3-p38 MAPK signalling.",Cancer Lett.,2019,"['Wen S', 'Hou Y', 'Fu L', 'Xi L', 'Yang D', 'Zhao M', 'Qin Y', 'Sun K', 'Teng Y', 'Liu M']",

Targeting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress can promote cancer cell death and inhibit epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in metastatic tumors. This study aimed to determine if Honokiol could promote ER stress-dependent apoptosis and regulate metastatic melanoma. The therapeutic efficacy of Honokiol was assessed using the highly metastatic melanoma xenograft mouse model for peritoneal metastasis and evaluated by computed tomography imaging. The ER stress marker, Calpain-10, delineated a novel proteolytic cleavage enzyme, while CHOP/GADD153-regulated apoptosis was used for gene silencing to determine the role of the β-catenin/MITF axis in melanoma cells. The results showed that Honokiol effectively decreased peritoneal dissemination and organ metastasis via ER stress activation and EMT marker inhibition. Knockdown Calpain-10 or CHOP/GADD153 blocked all of the biological effects in Honokiol-induced β-catenin/MITF cleavage, ERSE or TCF/LEF luciferase activity, and β-catenin kinase activity. These findings suggest that Honokiol can significantly thwart the progression of highly metastatic melanoma using the β-catenin/MITF axis via prompt Calpain-10 and CHOP/GADD153 regulated cascades.",Cancer Lett.,2019,"['Chiu CS', 'Tsai CH', 'Hsieh MS', 'Tsai SC', 'Jan YJ', 'Lin WY', 'Lai DW', 'Wu SM', 'Hsing HY', 'Arbiser JL', 'Sheu ML']",

RESULTS: The four MCNs were diagnosed in patients with ages between 46 and 75 years. Other clinical particularities were the following: one benign case, splenic rupture as result of a giant cystic tumor on the tail of the pancreas directly invading the spleen in the second one, metastases in the accessory spleen in the third one and invasion of the abdominal vessels in the fourth case. In all of these cases, the ovarian-like stroma tested positivity for calretinin, progesterone receptor (PR) and, in cases 2 and 3, for AE1/AE3 keratin. The malignant tumor cells were marked by carcinoembryonic antigen, HER-2, maspin, PR and the neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin, CD56, and neuron-specific enolase.

However, the molecular mechanisms through which GBC cells interact with the tumor microenvironment (TME) remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the role of the tumor suppressor apoptosis-stimulating of p53 protein 2 (ASPP2) in regulating GBC invasion and metastasis and macrophage recruitment. The clinicopathological significance of ASPP2 expression was measured by immunohistochemical analysis in 72 patients with GBC. Lentivirus-mediated knockdown or overexpression of ASPP2 was used to investigate the biological functions and molecular mechanisms of ASPP2 in GBC cells. Our data showed that downregulation of ASPP2 in patients with GBC was linked to poor prognosis. Knockdown of ASPP2 induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in GBC cells and influenced the TME. Mechanistically, we further confirmed that ASPP2 affected the expression and protein binding between atypical protein kinase C (aPKC)-ι and glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1). ASPP2 also induced C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL) 2, CCL5, and tumor necrosis factor-α secretion by cancer cells, thereby promoting macrophage recruitment. The latter also induced EMT-like changes in GBC. Furthermore, ASPP2 deficiency regulated GLI1 transcriptional activity via the noncanonical Hedgehog (Hh) pathway and aPKC-ι/GLI1 signaling loop and promoted GLI1 nuclear localization and binding to the promoters of target genes. Our findings revealed that downregulation of ASPP2 promoted GBC invasion and metastasis through the aPKC-ι/GLI1 pathway and enhanced macrophage recruitment. Thus, ASPP2/aPKC-ι/GLI1 pathway may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of GBC.",Cell Death Dis,2018,"['Tian L', 'Deng Z', 'Xu L', 'Yang T', 'Yao W', 'Ji L', 'Lu Y', 'Zhang J', 'Liu Y', 'Wang J']",

Solute carrier family 27 member 4 (SLC27A4) is a fatty acid transporter protein and is related to very long chain acyl-CoA synthetase activity. In the present study, bioinformatic analysis revealed that relatively high SLC27A4 expression was observed in all subtypes of breast tumor tissues when compared to normal breast tissues. Silencing SLC27A4 expression significantly reduced uptake of free fatty acids in two breast cancer cell lines, Hs578T and MDA-MB-231. Cell growth inhibition was observed in SLC27A4-silenced Hs578T and cell cycle was arrested at G2/M. In addition, the capacity of migration and invasion decreased in both cell lines after knockdown of SLC27A4. The epithelial⁻mesenchymal transition signaling pathway was inhibited because protein expression of Slug, vimentin, α-smooth muscle actin, and other regulators was lower than that in control cells.

Through microRNA microarray analysis, in silico, and RT‑qPCR analyses, we identified 268 microRNAs differentially expressed between DEX‑treated and untreated cells. With a focus on cancer progression, we selected miR‑132 and its target gene, transforming growth factor-β2 (TGF‑β2), as top candidates. miR‑132 mimics directly bound to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of a TGF‑β2 luciferase construct and enhanced expression, as shown by increased luciferase activity. By contrast, DEX inhibited miR‑132 expression via promoter methylation. miR‑132 mimics also reduced DEX‑induced clonogenicity, migration and expression of vimentin and E‑cadherin in vitro and in tumor xenografts. In patients, GC intake prior to surgery enhanced global hypermethylation and expression of TGF‑β2 in tissues; expression of miR‑132 was detected but could not be quantified.

30385823,Tumour budding is associated with the mesenchymal colon cancer subtype and RAS/RAF mutations: a study of 1320 colorectal cancers with Consensus Molecular Subgroup (CMS) data.,"BACKGROUND: Tumour budding is an important prognostic factor in colorectal cancer (CRC). Molecular profiling of tumour buds suggests (partial) epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem-cell phenotype, similarly described in the ""mesenchymal"" Consensus Molecular Subtype 4 (CMS4), which identifies a particularly poor prognostic subgroup. Here, we determine the association of tumour budding with CMS classification, prognosis, and response to therapy.
METHODS: AMC-AJCCII-90 cohort (n = 76, stage II) was evaluated for peritumoural budding on H&E slides. LUMC (n = 270, stage I-IV), CAIRO (n = 504, metastatic CRC) and CAIRO2 (n = 472, metastatic CRC) cohorts were investigated for intratumoural budding using pan-cytokeratin-stained tissue microarrays. Budding was scored as count/area, then classified as <5 or ≥5 buds. For all cohorts, CMS classifications were available (gene-expression/immunohistochemistry-based classifiers).
RESULTS: High (≥5) budding predicted a worse outcome in multivariate analysis in AMC-AJCCII-90 (p = 0.018), LUMC (p < 0.0001), and CAIRO (p = 0.03), and in CAIRO2 (continuous variable, p = 0.02). Tumour budding counts were higher in CMS4 compared to epithelial CMS2/3 cancers (p < 0.01, all), and associated with KRAS/BRAF mutations (p < 0.01, AMC-AJCCII-90, CAIRO, CAIRO2).
CONCLUSION: Tumour budding is an adverse prognostic factor across all CRC stages and is associated with the mesenchymal CMS4 phenotype. KRAS/BRAF mutations are strongly correlated with tumour budding suggesting their involvement in the regulation of this process.",Br. J.

30385615,CXADR-Mediated Formation of an AKT Inhibitory Signalosome at Tight Junctions Controls Epithelial-Mesenchymal Plasticity in Breast Cancer.,"Tight junctions (TJ) act as hubs for intracellular signaling pathways controlling epithelial cell fate and function. Deregulation of TJ is a hallmark of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which contributes to carcinoma progression and metastasis. However, the signaling mechanisms linking TJ to the induction of EMT are not understood. Here, we identify a TJ-based signalosome, which controls AKT signaling and EMT in breast cancer. The coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CXADR), a TJ protein with an essential yet uncharacterized role in organogenesis and tissue homeostasis, was identified as a key component of the signalosome. CXADR regulated the stability and function of the phosphatases and AKT inhibitors PTEN and PHLPP2. Loss of CXADR led to hyperactivation of AKT and sensitized cells to TGFβ1-induced EMT. Conversely, restoration of CXADR stabilized PHLPP2 and PTEN, inhibited AKT, and promoted epithelial differentiation. Loss of CXADR in luminal A breast cancer correlated with loss of PHLPP2 and PTEN and poor prognosis. These results show that CXADR promotes the formation of an AKT-inhibitory signalosome at TJ and regulates epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity in breast cancer cells. Moreover, loss of CXADR might be used as a prognostic marker in luminal breast cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: The tight junction protein CXADR controls epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity in breast cancer by stabilizing the AKT regulators PTEN and PHLPP2.",Cancer Res.,2019,"['Nilchian A', 'Johansson J', 'Ghalali A', 'Asanin ST', 'Santiago A', 'Rosencrantz O', 'Sollerbrant K', 'Vincent CT', 'Sund M', 'Stenius U', 'Fuxe J']",

The present study examined the effects of lncRNA HOXA cluster antisense RNA2 (HOXA-AS2) on the progression of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms.
METHODS: Quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect HOXA-AS2, miR-520c-3p and S100 calcium-binding protein A4 (S100A4) expression. Furthermore, the effects of HOXA-AS2 silencing and overexpression on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were assessed in PTC in vitro by CCK8 and transwell assay. Furthermore, bioinformatics online programs predicted and luciferase reporter assay were used to validate the association of HOXA-AS2 and miR-520c-3p in PTC.
RESULTS: We observed that HOXA-AS2 was up-regulated in PTC tissues. In vitro experiments revealed that HOXA-AS2 knockdown significantly inhibited cell growth in PTC in vitro and in vivo. Further functional assays indicated that HOXA-AS2 significantly promoted PTC cell migration and invasion by promoting EMT. Bioinformatics online programs predicted that HOXA-AS2 sponge miR-520c-3p at 3'-UTR with complementary binding sites, which was validated using luciferase reporter assay. HOXA-AS2 could negatively regulate the expression of miR-520c-3p in PTC cells. MiR-520c-3p was down-regulated in PTC tissues, and S100A4 was predicted as a downstream target of miR-520c-3p, which was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay.
CONCLUSION: In summary, our results suggested that the HOXA-AS2/miR-520c-3p/S100A4 axis may play an important role in the regulation of PTC progression, which provides us with new insights into understanding the PTC.",Cell.

30383835,Identification of highly connected and differentially expressed gene subnetworks in metastasizing endometrial cancer.,"We have identified nine highly connected and differentially expressed gene subnetworks between aggressive primary tumors and metastatic lesions in endometrial carcinomas. We implemented a novel pipeline combining gene set and network approaches, which here allows integration of protein-protein interactions and gene expression data. The resulting subnetworks are significantly associated with disease progression across tumor stages from complex atypical hyperplasia, primary tumors to metastatic lesions. The nine subnetworks include genes related to metastasizing features such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), hypoxia and cell proliferation. TCF4 and TWIST2 were found as central genes in the subnetwork related to EMT. Two of the identified subnetworks display statistically significant association to patient survival, which were further supported by an independent validation in the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas data collection. The first subnetwork contains genes related to cell proliferation and cell cycle, while the second contains genes involved in hypoxia such as HIF1A and EGLN3. Our findings provide a promising context to elucidate the biological mechanisms of metastasis, suggest potential prognostic markers and further identify therapeutic targets.

However, AE increased the serum testosterone level compared to the vehicle control group. Furthermore, our investigation of the inhibitory effects on angiogenesis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes revealed that AE downregulated matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP)-2, (MMP)-9, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), zinc finger protein (SNAIL1), twist-related protein 1 (TWIST1), and zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) in vivo.

30379847,Molecular characterization of breast and lung tumors by integration of multiple data types with functional sparse-factor analysis.,"Effective cancer treatment is crucially dependent on the identification of the biological processes that drive a tumor. However, multiple processes may be active simultaneously in a tumor. Clustering is inherently unsuitable to this task as it assigns a tumor to a single cluster. In addition, the wide availability of multiple data types per tumor provides the opportunity to profile the processes driving a tumor more comprehensively. Here we introduce Functional Sparse-Factor Analysis (funcSFA) to address these challenges. FuncSFA integrates multiple data types to define a lower dimensional space capturing the relevant variation. A tailor-made module associates biological processes with these factors. FuncSFA is inspired by iCluster, which we improve in several key aspects. First, we increase the convergence efficiency significantly, allowing the analysis of multiple molecular datasets that have not been pre-matched to contain only concordant features. Second, FuncSFA does not assign tumors to discrete clusters, but identifies the dominant driver processes active in each tumor. This is achieved by a regression of the factors on the RNA expression data followed by a functional enrichment analysis and manual curation step. We apply FuncSFA to the TCGA breast and lung datasets. We identify EMT and Immune processes common to both cancer types. In the breast cancer dataset we recover the known intrinsic subtypes and identify additional processes. These include immune infiltration and EMT, and processes driven by copy number gains on the 8q chromosome arm. In lung cancer we recover the major types (adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) and processes active in both of these types. These include EMT, two immune processes, and the activity of the NFE2L2 transcription factor. We validate the breast cancer findings on the METABRIC set and demonstrate the translatability of the TCGA breast cancer factors to METABRIC. In summary, FuncSFA is a robust method to perform discovery of key driver processes in a collection of tumors through unsupervised integration of multiple molecular data types and functional annotation.",PLoS Comput.

30379332,SIX1 is upregulated in gastric cancer and regulates proliferation and invasion by targeting the ERK pathway and promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition.,"Sine oculis homeobox homologue 1 (SIX1) is a Six class homeobox gene conserved throughout many species. It has been reported to act as an oncogene and is overexpressed in many cancers. However, the function and regulatory mechanism of SIX1 in gastric cancer (GC) remains unclear. In our study, we detected protein levels of SIX1 via immunohistochemistry (IHC) and its proliferation and invasion effects via CCK8 and transwell assays. Additionally, expression of cyclin D1, MMP2, p-ERK, and EMT-related proteins was measured by western blotting. We found that SIX1 had significantly higher expression in GC tissues and that it could promote GC cell proliferation and invasion. Also, overexpression of SIX1 increased the expression of cyclin D1, MMP2, p-ERK, and EMT-related proteins, which could all be inhibited by knocking down SIX1. In conclusion, SIX1 is upregulated in GC tissues. It can promote GC cell proliferation by targeting cyclin D1, invasion via ERK signalling, and EMT pathways by targeting MMP2 and E-cadherin. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Our study showed that SIX1 was upregulated in GC tissues, and promoted GC cell proliferation by targeting cyclin D1, invasion via ERK signalling, and EMT pathways by targeting MMP2 and E-cadherin.

However, the clinical relevance of ERO1α and its molecular mechanisms underlying tumor progression have not been determined for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). ERO1α expression levels in HCC tissues and cells were detected by quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting. ERO1α shRNAs and overexpression vector were transfected into HCC cells to downregulate or upregulate ERO1α expression. In vitro and in vivo assays were performed to investigate the function of ERO1α in invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis of HCC. We found high ERO1α expression in HCC tissues and cells that was significantly associated with metastasis and poor clinicopathologic features of vascular invasion, advanced Edmondson Grade, and TNM stage. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies showed that ERO1α prompted migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and angiogenesis of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Further studies verified a positive correlation between ERO1α and S1PR1, upregulated in metastatic HCC tissues compared with HCC tissues without metastasis. S1PR1 knockdown markedly diminished the effects of ERO1α on HCC cell migration, invasion and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. Most importantly, ERO1α knockdown significantly repressed the death of HCC xenograft mouse models by reducing tumor distant metastasis, and host angiogenesis by suppressing the expression of S1PR1, p-STAT3, and VEGF-A in HCC cells. Our findings suggest that ERO1α is significantly correlated with reduced survival and poor prognosis, and promotes HCC metastasis and angiogenesis by triggering the S1PR1/STAT3/VEGF-A signaling pathway.

30375704,All-trans retinoic acid reverses epithelial-mesenchymal transition in paclitaxel-resistant cells by inhibiting nuclear factor kappa B and upregulating gap junctions.,"Paclitaxel is a widely used chemotherapy drug, but development of resistance leads to treatment failure. Tumor cells that are treated with a sublethal dose of paclitaxel for a long period of time show the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype, which leads to metastasis and resistance. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is always used in combination with paclitaxel and can reverse EMT in many types of cancer cells. The ability of ATRA to reverse EMT in chemoresistant cells is still unknown. In the present study, the ability of ATRA to reverse EMT in paclitaxel-resistant cells was investigated. Three colorectal cancer cell lines, HCT116, LoVo and CT26, were treated with sublethal doses of paclitaxel to create resistant cell lines. Western blotting, immunocytochemistry, and ""parachute"" dye-coupling assays showed that ATRA reverses EMT, inhibits nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κΒ), and upregulates gap junctions in paclitaxel-resistant cells. Scratch wound-healing and Transwell assays showed that ATRA decreases the migration and invasion abilities of paclitaxel-resistant cells. In addition, the CT26 cell line was used in the Balb/c pulmonary metastasis model to show that ATRA reduces metastasis of paclitaxel-resistant cells in vivo. Given these data, ATRA may reverse EMT by inhibiting NF-κΒ and upregulating gap junctions in paclitaxel-resistant cells.",Cancer Sci.,2019,"['Shi G', 'Zheng X', 'Wu X', 'Wang S', 'Wang Y', 'Xing F']",
30375371,"Sialyltransferase ST3GAL1 promotes cell migration, invasion, and TGF-β1-induced EMT and confers paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer.","Sialyltransferases transfer sialic acid to nascent oligosaccharides and are upregulated in cancer. The inhibition of sialyltransferases is emerging as a potential strategy to prevent metastasis in several cancers, including ovarian cancer. ST3GAL1 is a sialyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid from cytidine monophosphate-sialic acid to galactose-containing substrates and is associated with cancer progression and chemoresistance. However, the function of ST3GAL1 in ovarian cancer is uncertain. Herein, we use qRT-PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry to assess the expression of ST3GAL1 in ovarian cancer tissue and cell lines and investigate whether it influences resistance to paclitaxel in vitro and in a mouse xenograft model. We found that ST3GAL1 is upregulated in ovarian cancer tissues and in the ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV-3 and OVCAR3 but downregulated in A2780 ovarian cancer cells. Overexpression of ST3GAL1 in A2780 cells increases cell growth, migration, and invasion whereas ST3GAL1 knockdown in SKOV-3 cells decreases cell growth, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, overexpression of ST3GAL1 increases resistance to paclitaxel while downregulation of ST3GAL1 decreases resistance to paclitaxel in vitro, and overexpression of ST3GAL1 increases tumorigenicity and resistance to paclitaxel in vivo. Transforming growth factor-β1 can increase ST3GAL1 expression and induce ovarian cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, knockdown of ST3GAL1 inhibits EMT expression. Taken together, our findings have identified a regulatory mechanism involving ST3GAL1 in ovarian cancer. ST3GAL1 may be a promising target for overcoming paclitaxel resistance in ovarian carcinoma.",Cell Death Dis,2018,"['Wu X', 'Zhao J', 'Ruan Y', 'Sun L', 'Xu C', 'Jiang H']",

However, the effects and underlying mechanisms of human adipocytes on breast cancer cells remain largely unknown. In recent years, several reports have revealed the oncogenic role of long non-coding RNA PVT1 in breast cancer. Here, we aimed to investigate the role and underlying mechanisms of PVT1 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells cultured with mature adipogenic medium. At first, we successfully induced adipogenic differentiation from human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells and collected the mature adipogenic medium to mimic excessive adiposity. Our results demonstrated that the mature adipogenic medium promoted the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, enhanced the cell viability and migration potential of TNBC cells. In addition, we proved that mature adipogenic medium affected the PVT1 expression and inhibition of the PVT1 disturbed the role of mature adipogenic medium in TNBC cells. Finally, we illustrated that repression of p21 restored the phenotype caused by PVT1 knockdown in TNBC cells treated with mature adipogenic medium.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The expression of E-cadherin (E-CAD) and transcription factors TWIST, SLUG and SNAIL in follicular thyroid tumours was examined by immunohistochemistry in tissue samples, including 18 follicular adenomas (FA), 12 minimally invasive follicular thyroid carcinomas (MI-FTC), 16 widely invasive follicular thyroid carcinomas (WI-FTC), 10 poorly differentiated follicular thyroid carcinomas (PDTC) and six anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATC). Metastatic tumour tissues from six of these cases were also examined. The results showed an increasing expression trend of EMT regulators in a panel of follicular tumour cases with a spectrum of morphological subtypes from low- to high-risk malignancy. The expression of EMT regulators was higher in the WI-FTC, PDTC and ATC groups but focal and lower in the FA and MI-FTC groups. Different expression intensity of E-CAD and EMT regulators at the tumour centre part and the invasive front (IF) was observed. The loss of E-CAD and expression of EMT regulators was significantly correlated with distant metastasis and vascular invasion (VI) in the well-differentiated follicular carcinoma (WD-FTC), and six tumours of metastatic sites also showed variables positive for EMT regulators. The disease-free survival analysis showed an apparent relationship between the expression of EMT regulators and the tumour disease-free outcomes in WD-FTC.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study supported the role of EMT in the development of follicular thyroid carcinoma and indicated that EMT regulatory proteins may play an important role in WD-FTC that are widely invasive and exhibit distant metastasis.",Histopathology,2019,"['Wu J', 'Zhang Y', 'Cheng R', 'Gong W', 'Ding T', 'Zhai Q', 'Wang Y', 'Meng B', 'Sun B']",

30367545,Hypoxia-driven paracrine osteopontin/integrin αvβ3 signaling promotes pancreatic cancer cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cell-like properties by modulating forkhead box protein M1.,"Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), a key component of the tumor microenvironment, contribute to tumor invasion, metastasis, and chemoresistance. Osteopontin (OPN), a phosphorylated glycoprotein, is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer. However, OPN expression in PSCs and its potential roles in tumor-stroma interactions remain unclear. The present study first showed that OPN is highly expressed and secreted in activated PSCs driven by hypoxia, and this process is in a ROS-dependent manner; in addition, OPN was shown to be involved in the PSC-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell (CSC)-like properties of pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs). Mechanistically, OPN from activated PSCs interacts with the transmembrane receptor integrin αvβ3 on PCCs to upregulate forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1) expression and induce malignant phenotypes of PCCs. Moreover, the Akt and Erk pathways participate in OPN/integrin αvβ3 axis-induced FOXM1 expression of PCCs. Our further analysis showed that OPN and FOXM1 are significantly upregulated in pancreatic cancer tissues and are associated with poor clinical outcome, indicating that OPN and FOXM1 might be considered as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for patients with pancreatic cancer. In conclusion, we show here for the first time that OPN promotes the EMT and CSC-like properties of PCCs by activating the integrin αvβ3-Akt/Erk-FOXM1 cascade in a paracrine manner, suggesting that targeting the tumor microenvironment represents a promising therapeutic strategy in pancreatic cancer.",Mol Oncol,2019,"['Cao J', 'Li J', 'Sun L', 'Qin T', 'Xiao Y', 'Chen K', 'Qian W', 'Duan W', 'Lei J', 'Ma J', 'Ma Q', 'Han L']",

30365154,miR‑27a promotes human breast cancer cell migration by inducing EMT in a FBXW7‑dependent manner.,"Increasingly, evidence has revealed that aberrant microRNA (miRNA) expression is involved in breast cancer carcinogenesis and further progression, including metastasis. miRNA (miR)‑27a was previously identified to be abnormally expressed and to serve pro‑oncogenic functions in multiple human cancer types, including breast cancer. However, its functions and underlying mechanisms in breast cancer remain poorly understood. In the present study, it was demonstrated that miR‑27a was significantly upregulated in breast cancer tissues and cell lines compared with their normal counterparts. Overexpression of miR‑27a resulted in enhanced cell migration by inducing epithelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition, while its knockdown effectively reversed these cellular events. The present study additionally confirmed for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that F‑box and WD repeat domain containing 7 (FBXW7) is a downstream target gene of miR‑27a in human breast cancer cells. FBXW7 is underexpressed in breast cancer tissues and cell lines, and is an independent positive factor for the overall survival rate of patients with breast cancer. Notably, the ectopic expression of FBXW7 may effectively suppress the epithelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition and migratory activity of breast cancer cells, in addition to reversing the cell migration mediated by miR‑27a. Altogether, the results of the present study indicated the important function of miR‑27a in regulating the metastasis of breast cancer in a FBXW7‑dependent manner, and provide evidence for the potential application of miR‑27a in breast cancer therapy.",Mol Med Rep,2018,"['Jiang G', 'Shi W', 'Fang H', 'Zhang X']",

In the present study, we used immunohistochemistry to determine that phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes‑15 kDa (PEA15) was highly expressed in colorectal cancer tissues and liver metastatic cancer tissues. It was also highly expressed in metastatic colorectal cancer patients compared to non‑metastatic patients. Through clinicopathological data of patients with liver metastasis of colorectal cancer, we found that high expression of PEA15 was positively correlated with TNM staging, liver metastasis and poor prognosis of colorectal cancer patients. Using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, western blotting and cell proliferation, migration and invasion assays, we also determined that PEA15 could promote cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the characteristics of cancer stem cells in vitro, thus promoting the abilities of invasion and migration. In addition, we revealed that PEA15 promoted the liver metastasis of colorectal cancer cells in a xenograft tumor metastasis model. In addition, concerning the mechanism, we used gene chip analysis to determine that PEA15 upregulated the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway in colorectal cancer cells. Therefore, we concluded that PEA15 may be a potential biomarker for liver metastasis of colorectal cancer therapy.

We investigated the anti‑metastatic properties of Galla Rhois water extract (GRWE) on metastatic CRC cells. The effect of GRWE on the viability of colon 26 (CT26) cells was evaluated using WST‑8 assay. Annexin V assay and western blot analysis were performed to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in apoptosis. GRWE suppressed viability of CT26 cells by inducing apoptosis through the cleavage of caspase‑3 and PARP, downregulation of caspase‑8, caspase‑9, Bcl‑2 and Bcl‑xL, and upregulation of Bax. Metastatic phenotypes such as epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration, and invasion of CRC cells were investigated by real‑time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, wound healing assay, and matrigel invasion assay, respectively. Non‑cytotoxic concentrations of GRWE inhibited EMT in CRC cells by regulating the expression of EMT markers.

However, further clarification is required to determine if SphK1 promotes the metastasis of colorectal cancer by inducing epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT), and its mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Immunohistochemistry staining was used to detect protein expression in normal colonic mucosa tissues and colorectal cancer tissues. Cells were transfected to overexpress SphK1, downregulate SphK1 or downregulate FAK. An MTT assay was used to detect the drug toxicity to cells. Transwell and wound healing assays were used to detect cell migration ability. Reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were used to detect the expression of mRNA and protein, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the microvilli and pseudopodia of the cells. The analysis of protein expression in 114 human colorectal cancer tissues demonstrated that the expressions of SphK1, FAK, phosphorylated (p)‑FAK, E‑cadherin and vimentin were associated with the metastasis of colorectal cancer. Furthermore, the patients with colorectal cancer with SphK1‑positive cancer demonstrated poorer prognosis compared with SphK1‑negative cancer. FAK knockdown and SphK1 knockdown of human colon cancer RKO cells inhibited the EMT and migrational potency, along with the expression of p‑FAK, p‑protein kinase B (AKT) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2/9. In contrast, SphK1 overexpression promoted EMT, migrational potency, and the expression of p‑FAK, p‑AKT and MMP2/9 in HT29 cells. Additionally, the EMT and migrational potency of SphK1‑overexpressing HT29 cells was suppressed by a FAK inhibitor, and the expression of p‑FAK, p‑AKT and MMP2/9 was suppressed by blocking the FAK pathway.

30365080,Zeylenone represses the progress of human prostate cancer by downregulating the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common types of cancer in the urinary system in men. Zeylenone (Zey), a naturally occurring cyclohexene oxide, has an anticancer effect. In the present study, the role and potential mechanism of Zey in PCa were examined. The proliferative, invasive and migratory capacities of DU145 cells were analyzed using Cell Counting Kit‑8, transwell and wound healing assays, respectively. The expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)‑2 and MMP‑9 were determined with an ELISA. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting assays were performed to evaluate the expression levels of extracellular matrix, epithelial‑mesenchymal transition and Wnt/β‑catenin pathway‑associated factors. In the present study, it was observed that Zey not only suppressed the viability of DU145 cells; however, it additionally attenuated the invasive and migratory capacities of cells in a concentration‑dependent manner. Treatment of Zey decreased the expression levels of MMP‑2, MMP‑9 and fibronectin‑1; whereas, it increased tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases‑1 and collagen‑1 expression levels. Additionally, the vimentin expression level was downregulated, however, the epithelial‑cadherin expression level was upregulated in cells treated with Zey. Furthermore, Zey decreased the expression levels of wnt5a, β‑catenin and cyclin D1. In conclusion, the present results demonstrated that Zey decreased the viability and metastasis of human PCa cells (DU145), via the Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway. Therefore, Zey may be applied as a novel drug for treating PCa in the future.",Mol Med Rep,2018,"['Zeng S', 'Zhu B', 'Zeng J', 'Wu W', 'Jiang C']",
30365057,Betulinic acid inhibits stemness and EMT of pancreatic cancer cells via activation of AMPK signaling.,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are found in various types of human cancer, including pancreatic cancer, possess elevated metastatic potential, lead to tumor recurrence and cause chemoradiotherapy resistance. Alterations in cellular bioenergetics through the regulation of 5' adenosine monophosphate‑activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling may be a prerequisite to stemness. Betulinic acid (BA) is a well‑known bioactive compound with antiretroviral and anti‑inflammatory potential, which has been reported to exert anticancer effects on various types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer. The present study aimed to investigate whether BA could inhibit pancreatic CSCs via regulation of AMPK signaling. The proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells was examined by MTT and colony formation assays. The migratory and invasive abilities of pancreatic cancer cells were assessed using wound‑scratch and Transwell invasion assays. In addition, the expression levels of candidate genes were measured by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The results revealed that BA inhibited the proliferation and tumorsphere formation of pancreatic cancer cells, suppressed epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration and invasion, and reduced the expression of three pluripotency factors [SRY‑box 2 (Sox2), octamer‑binding protein 4 (Oct4) and Nanog]. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that there was a significant inverse association between the expression levels of phosphorylated (P)‑AMPK and Sox2 in pancreatic cancer, and it was revealed that BA may activate AMPK signaling. Notably, knockdown of AMPK reversed the suppressive effects of BA on EMT and stemness of pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, BA reversed the effects of gemcitabine on stemness and enhanced the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine. Collectively, these results indicated that BA may effectively inhibit pluripotency factor expression (Sox2, Oct4 and Nanog), EMT and the stem‑like phenotype of pancreatic cancer cells via activating AMPK signaling. Therefore, BA may be considered an attractive therapeutic candidate and an effective inhibitor of the stem‑like phenotype in pancreatic cancer cells.

The present study revealed that SRF silencing constrained cervical cancer cell proliferation and invasion via controlling early growth response‑1 (Egr‑1). The results demonstrated that SRF was significantly increased in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines, compared with normal. Suppressing SRF, by using a loss‑of‑function experiment, constrained cervical cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and epithelial‑mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, SRF knockdown significantly downregulated Egr‑1 expression in cervical cancer cell lines, and overexpression of Egr‑1 reversed the effect of SRF on cell proliferation, invasion, and epithelial‑mesenchymal transition.

30362626,lncRNA DRHC inhibits proliferation and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma via c-Myb-regulated MEK/ERK signaling.,"Accumulating evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a crucial role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we reported a novel lncRNA, CTC-505O3 (lncRNA DRHC), that was downregulated in HCC and its low expression was associated with dismal survival. Gain-of-function studies indicated that it inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HCC cell lines in vitro. lncRNA DRHC also inhibited tumorigenicity in vivo. In mechanistic experiments, GO analysis based on NGS indicated that MAPK signaling was most affected. The result was confirmed by Western blot and this effect was abolished either by MEK1/2 specific inhibitor Trametinib or ERK1/2 inhibitor SCH772984. In addition, differences in proliferation and invasion were abrogated by Trametinib. Moreover, we found that lncRNA DRHC interacted with MYBBP1A and modulated MEK/ERK signaling via c-Myb.

30361686,Adipose stromal cell targeting suppresses prostate cancer epithelial-mesenchymal transition and chemoresistance.,"Fat tissue, overgrowing in obesity, promotes the progression of various carcinomas. Clinical and animal model studies indicate that adipose stromal cells (ASC), the progenitors of adipocytes, are recruited by tumors and promote tumor growth as tumor stromal cells. Here, we investigated the role of ASC in cancer chemoresistance and invasiveness, the attributes of tumor aggressiveness. By using human cell co-culture models, we demonstrate that ASC induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in prostate cancer cells. Our results for the first time demonstrate that ASC interaction renders cancer cells more migratory and resistant to docetaxel, cabazitaxel, and cisplatin chemotherapy. To confirm these findings in vivo, we compared cancer aggressiveness in lean and obese mice grafted with prostate tumors. We show that obesity promotes EMT in cancer cells and tumor invasion into the surrounding fat tissue. A hunter-killer peptide D-CAN, previously developed for targeted ASC ablation, suppressed the obesity-associated EMT and cancer progression. Importantly, cisplatin combined with D-CAN was more effective than cisplatin alone in suppressing growth of mouse prostate cancer allografts and xenografts even in non-obese mice. Our data demonstrate that ASC promote tumor aggressiveness and identify them as a target of combination cancer therapy.",Oncogene,2019,"['Su F', 'Ahn S', 'Saha A', 'DiGiovanni J', 'Kolonin MG']",

However, the function and clinical significance of FAT10 in breast cancer (BC) remains unclear. Here, we found that high FAT10 expression was detected frequently in primary BC tissues, and was closely associated with malignant phenotype and shorter survival among the BC patients. Multivariate analyses also revealed that FAT10 overexpression was independent prognostic factors for poor outcome of patients with BC. Function assay demonstrated that FAT10 knockdown significantly inhibited the metastasis abilities and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of breast cancer cell. Further investigation revealed that FAT10 directly bound ZEB2 and decreased its ubiquitination to enhance the protein stability of ZEB2 in BC cells. Moreover, our data shown that the pro-metastasis effect of FAT10 in BC is partially dependent on ZEB2 enhancement. Collectively, our data suggest that FAT10 plays a crucial oncogenic role in BC metastasis, and we provide a novel evidence that FAT10 may be serve as a prognostic and therapeutic target for BC patients.",Biochem.

30359388,Andrographolide enhances the anti-metastatic effect of radiation in Ras-transformed cells via suppression of ERK-mediated MMP-2 activity.,"BACKGROUND: Activation of Ras oncogene in human tumors is associated with radiation-associated metastatic potential. Although ionizing radiation is one important method of cancer treatments, it has been shown to enhance matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) activity and facilitates a more aggressive cancer phenotype. Our previous studies showed that andrographolide with lower dose rates of radiation could inhibit RAS-transformed cancer metastasis in vivo; however, the molecular mechanisms are not yet clear. In this study, we aimed to explore the anti-metastatic effect of andrographolide combined with radiation on Ras-transformed cells.
METHODS: RAS-transformed cells were treated with andrographolide in the presence or absence of irradiation (2-4 Gy) or angiotensin II to examine cell invasion. In vivo tumorigenesis assays were also performed. The MMP-2 activity was detected by using Gelatin zymography. Signal transduction of NF-κB subunit, p65 and phosphor-ERK 1/2, were examined by using Western blotting analysis.
RESULTS: Treatment with andrographolide inhibited migration of Ras-transformed cells. Andrographolide treatment with radiation significantly inhibited cancer metastasis in vivo. We found that andrographolide exhibited anti-migration and anti-invasive ability against cancer metastasis via inhibition of MMP2 activity rather than affected MMP-9 and EMT. In addition, combined andrographolide with radiation appeared to be more effective in reducing MMP-2 expression, and this effect was accompanied by suppression of ERK activation that inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that andrographolide enhances the anti-metastatic effect of radiation in Ras-transformed cells via suppression of ERK-mediated MMP-2 activity.",PLoS ONE,2018,"['Yu CC', 'Chen CA', 'Fu SL', 'Lin HY', 'Lee MS', 'Chiou WY', 'Su YC', 'Hung SK']",
30359265,Tumour-originated exosomal miR-155 triggers cancer-associated cachexia to promote tumour progression.,"Emerging evidence supports the pivotal roles of cancer-associated cachexia in breast cancer progression. However, the mediators and mechanisms that mediate cancer-induced cachexia remain unclear. Here, we show that breast cancer-derived exosomes alter adipocytes and muscle cells in terms of increased catabolism characterized by the release of metabolites. Likewise, tumour cells cocultivated with mature adipocytes or C2C12 exhibit an aggressive phenotype through inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Mechanistically, we show that cancer cell-secreted miR-155 promotes beige/brown differentiation and remodel metabolism in resident adipocytes by downregulating the PPARγ expression, but does not significantly affect biological conversion in C2C12. In vitro the use of propranolol ameliorates tumour exosomes-associated cachectic wasting through upregulating the PPARγ expression. These results demonstrate that cancer-derived exosomes reprogram systemic energy metabolism and accelerate cancer-associated cachexia to facilitate tumour progression.",Mol.

30355942,Activation of Nrf2 by Sulforaphane Inhibits High Glucose-Induced Progression of Pancreatic Cancer via AMPK Dependent Signaling.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Sulforaphane (SFN) is known for its potent bioactive properties, such as anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor effects. However, its anti-tumor effect on pancreatic cancer is still poorly understood. In the present study, we explored the therapeutic potential of SFN for pancreatic cancer and disclosed the underlying mechanism.
METHODS: Panc-1 and MiaPaca-2 cell lines were used in vitro. The biological function of SFN in pancreatic cancer was measured using EdU staining, colony formation, apoptosis, migration and invasion assays. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was measured using 2'-7'-Dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) fluorometric analysis. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to measure the protein levels of p-AMPK and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway-related proteins, and cellular translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Nude mice and transgenic pancreatic cancer mouse model were used to measure the therapeutic potential of SFN on pancreatic cancer.
RESULTS: SFN can inhibit pancreatic cancer cell growth， promote apoptosis, curb colony formation and temper the migratory and invasion ability of pancreatic cancer cells. Mechanistically, excessive ROS production induced by SFN activated AMPK signaling and promoted the translocation of Nrf2, resulting in cell viability inhibition of pancreatic cancer. Pretreatment with compound C, a small molecular inhibitor of AMPK signaling, reversed the subcellular translocation of Nrf2 and rescued cell invasion ability. With nude mice and pancreatic cancer transgenic mouse, we identified SFN could inhibit tumor progression, with smaller tumor size and slower tumor progression in SFN treatment group.
CONCLUSION: Our study not only elucidates the mechanism of SFN-induced inhibition of pancreatic cancer in both normal and high glucose condition, but also testifies the dual-role of ROS in pancreatic cancer progression. Collectively, our research suggests that SFN may serve as a potential therapeutic choice for pancreatic cancer.",Cell. Physiol.

30355927,"Downregulation of N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase GCNT3 by miR-302b-3p Decreases Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Cell Proliferation, Migration and Invasion.","BACKGROUND/AIMS: GCNT3 is a member of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase family involved with mucin biosynthesis. GCNT3 aberrant expression is known to promote the progression of several human cancers. However, its role in tumorigenesis and the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been well-characterized. Our study investigated the functional mechanisms of GCNT3 regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs) in NSCLC.
METHODS: The differential expression of mRNAs in NSCLC tissues and matched adjacent non-cancerous lung tissues from patients in Xuanwei, Yunnan province, China, was screened via mRNA microarray. The expression of GCNT3 and its correlation with NSCLC progression was measured in 92 paired tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues. The functions of GCNT3 in NSCLC cells and its underlying mechanisms were measured using siRNA and GCNT3-expression vectors. The miRNA immunoprecipitation (miRIP) method was used to identify the miRNAs targeting GCNT3. The protein were measured using western blot assay, and the mRNAs were measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. Cell proliferation was measured using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and a colony forming assays; cell migration and invasion assays were performed using 24-well Transwell chambers with 8-μm pores filter, and analyses of the cell cycle and apoptosis were performed via flow cytometric analysis. The dual luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm whether GCNT3 gene was a direct target of miR-302b-3p.
RESULTS: GCNT3 was found to be highly expressed in both NSCLC tissues and cell lines, and higher expression correlated significantly with advanced tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, positive lymph node metastasis, and poor overall survival. Knockdown of GCNT3 inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion ability of NSCLC cells, while overexpression facilitated these activities. Further mechanistic experiments using miRIP and dual luciferase reporter assays revealed that GCNT3 was a direct target of miR-302b-3p. Low expression of miR-302b-3p was found in NSCLC cells and negatively correlated with GCNT3 levels, while miR-302b-3p overexpression inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells. Co-transfection with miR-302b-3p and the expression vector of GCNT3 abrogated the effects of mir-302b-3p, confirming that miR-302b-3p inhibited NSCLC progression by targeting GCNT3. Western blotting revealed that E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, p-Erk and cyclin D1 were downstream molecules of miR-302b-3p/GCNT3 pathway.
CONCLUSION: miR-302b-3p/GCNT3 axis regulated cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by activating the Erk signaling pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which was identified as a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC.",Cell.

Some microRNAs are involved in tumor invasion and metastasis. Underexpression of miR-375 has been correlated with tumorigenesis, treatment resistance, and poor prognosis. In this study, we first analyzed the profiles and prognostic values of miR-375 expression in gastric cancer tissues from a public database, and the expression level of miR-375 in gastric cancer samples and gastric cancer cell lines was then analyzed by quantitative real- time polymerase chain reaction. Significant underexpression of miR-375 was seen in all the gastric cancer samples compared to paired paracarcinoma tissues, and the expression level of miR-375 in the gastric cancer cell lines was negatively associated with the cell migration ability. A Cell proliferation (CCK-8) assay was performed to examine cell viability. Overexpression of miR-375 suppressed the proliferation of gastric cancer cells. A Western blot analysis was carried out to test protein expression. Overexpression of miR-375 inhibited autophagy through the AKT/ mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway. MiR-375 regulated invasion and migration via AKT/ mammalian target of rapamycin pathway-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Wound healing and migration assays were used to determine the motility of gastric cancer cells. A gastric cancer xenograft nude mouse model was used for an in vivo efficacy evaluation. Overexpression of miR-375 significantly suppressed cell proliferation in the established gastric cancer xenograft nude mouse model. Our results demonstrate that increasing the expression level of miR-375 suppresses proliferation in vitro and in vivo, and they provide a mechanistic and applicable rationale for the future clinical evaluation of miR-375 in gastric cancer treatment.

The scope of this study is to characterize protein repertoire able to predict patient outcome in BC according to ECM gene expression pattern and histological grade. The differential proteomic analysis is based on 2D-differential gel electrophoresis, MALDI-MS, bioinformatics, and immunoblotting. Results suggest a relationship among ECM remodeling, signal mechanotransduction, and metabolic rewiring in BCs characterized by a specific mRNA ECM signature and identified a set of dysregulated proteins characteristic of hormone receptors expression as fibrinogen-β chain, collagen α-1(VI) chain, and α-1B-glycoprotein. Furthermore, in triple negative tumors with ECM signature, the FGG and α5β1/αvβ3 integrins increase whereas detyrosinated α-tubulin and mimecan decrease leading to unorganized integrin presentation involving focal adhesion kinase, activation of Rho GTPases associated to epithelial mesenchymal transition.

The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of lnc-ATB and miR-141-3p, and to determine whether lnc-ATB can regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by miR-141-3p in breast cancer. Here, we found that lnc-ATB was highly expressed, whereas there was low expression of miR-141-3p in breast cancer tissues and cells. Knockdown of lnc-ATB in two breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and BT549) significantly increased miR-141-3p expression. Down-regulation of lnc-ATB resulted in a morphological change of breast cancer cells from spindle-like to a round shape, and in a remarkable inhibition of cell migration and invasion, which were reversed by miR-141-3p inhibitor. Furthermore, we demonstrated that lnc-ATB knockdown decreased ZEB1, ZEB2, N-cadherin, and vimentin expression, and promoted E-cadherin expression, while miR-141-3p inhibitor could reverse those effects. Moreover, we proved that miR-141-3p directly bound to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of ZEB1 and ZEB2 and negatively regulated ZEB1 and ZEB2 expression. Taken together, our results show that knockdown of lnc-ATB significantly inhibits the EMT process of breast cancer cells by increasing the expression of miR-141-3p, indicating that lnc-ATB might serve as a novel therapeutic target for breast cancer.",Biochem.

However, the role of RIT1 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is unclear. In this study, we found that the expression of RIT1 is downregulated in ESCC compared to corresponding non-tumor tissues. The low-level expression of RIT1 was correlated with poorer prognosis. Then we showed that RIT1 inhibited proliferation, invasion, and migration of ESCC cells, and silencing RIT1 by shRNA promoted tumorigenicity and metastasis in nude mice. We further demonstrated that RIT1 inhibited the malignant behaviors of ESCC through inhibiting the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in ESCC cells. Our study also revealed that RIT1 increased drug sensitivity to cisplatin (CDDP), and this function could be carried out through downregulating stemness of ESCC. In conclusion, our study indicates for the first time that RIT1 displays tumor-suppressing functions in ESCC, and these functions were carried out by inhibiting MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, inhibiting EMT, and downregulating cancer stemness of ESCC cells.",Cell Death Dis,2018,"['Feng YF', 'Lei YY', 'Lu JB', 'Xi SY', 'Zhang Y', 'Huang QT', 'Wu QL', 'Wang F']",
30348114,"ACTL6A expression promotes invasion, metastasis and epithelial mesenchymal transition of colon cancer.","BACKGROUND: Metastasis is the main cause of death in patients with advanced stage colon cancer. Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in invasion and metastasis. Actin-like 6A (ACTL6A) is vital for embryogenesis and differentiation and is also critical for metastasis and EMT in hepatocellular carcinoma, as observed in our previous study. In the present study, we further explored the role of ACTL6A in colon cancer metastasis.
METHODS: ACTL6A expression levels were analyzed in normal colon, colon adenoma and colon cancer specimens using public databases and tissue samples. ACTL6A expression and its association with clinicopathologic features of colon cancer patients were also analyzed. ACTL6A-overexpression and ACTL6A-knockdown colon cancer cells were used to perform cytological experiments to explore the potential biological function of ACTL6A in metastasis and EMT in colon cancer.
RESULTS: The data from both the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Oncomine databases showed that ACTL6A expression levels in colon adenoma and cancer were higher than those in normal colon samples. The ACTL6A expression level in fresh colon cancer specimens was also higher than that in the corresponding adjacent normal colon specimens. Patients with high ACTL6A expression directly correlated with advanced pT status, distant metastasis, poor differentiation and microvascular/perineural invasion. ACTL6A overexpression promoted migration and invasion of colon cancer cells, whereas ACTL6A knockdown exhibited the opposite effect in vitro. Moreover, we demonstrated that ACTL6A promoted EMT in colon cancer cells in vitro.

30347648,Unfractionated and Low Molecular Weight Heparin Reduce Platelet Induced Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Pancreatic and Prostate Cancer Cells.,"The interaction with platelets is of crucial importance for tumor cells passing through hematogenous metastasis. Platelets protect cancer cells from immune surveillance and exhibit many other prometastatic effects. Notably, platelets can change the epithelial tumor phenotype, a process termed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which confers stem cell-like properties onto tumor cells associated with an increased motility and drug resistance. The aim of the study is to investigate the impact of heparin on the platelet induced EMT program in pancreatic and prostate tumor cells. Platelet activation and interaction with cancer cells were determined by static adhesion assays. Applying ELISAs, the platelet release of EMT inducing mediators was quantified. EMT marker protein expression by tumor cells was explored by western blot and qPCR. Our data show that different tumor cell entities have different platelet binding capacities and also that a weak interaction is sufficient to change tumor cell phenotype. Additionally, unfractionated heparin (UFH) as well as low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) reduced tumor cell platelet interaction. Subsequently, attenuated platelet-derived mediator release resulted in reduced EMT marker protein and transcription factor expression by the cancer cells and decreased cell migration. These data suggest that heparin reduces platelet induced EMT program and prevents the formation of cancer cells with stem cell-like properties. This additional mechanism argues for the use of heparin in oncological applications.",Molecules,2018,"['Ponert JM', 'Gockel LM', 'Henze S', 'Schlesinger M']",

Recently, the extracellular protein secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) has been reported closely related to tumorigenesis. Some articles have suggested that SPARC promoted metastasis in several highly metastatic tumors. However, there are also some studies shown that SPARC acted as an antitumor factor. SPARC-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in melanoma cells and promoted EMT in hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, the role of SPARC in tumorigenesis and its relationship with EMT is still unclear. In this study, we investigated the expression change of SPARC in A549 and H1299 lung cancer cells undergoing EMT process. Our study indicated that SPARC was upregulated in A549 and H1299 cells EMT process. We further investigated the function of SPARC on proliferation, migration, and EMT process of A549 and H1299 cells. Overexpression of SPARC promoted the migration and EMT of A549 and H1299 cells. Knockdown SPARC inhibited the EMT of A549 cells. Overexpression of SPARC induced the increased expression of p-Akt and P-ERK. Furthermore, exogenous SPARC peptide promoted transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1-induced EMT of A549 and H1299 cells. SPARC knockdown partially eliminated TGF-β1 function in inducing EMT of A549 cells. SPARC follistatin-like functional domain reduced the expression of E-cadherin, but had no effect on the expression of p-Akt and p-ERK. In conclusion, we elucidated that SPARC contributes to tumorigenesis by promoting migration and EMT of A549 and H1299 lung cancer cells.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are involved in various mechanisms of tumor biology, which include oncogenesis, drug resistance, and tumor immune escape, as well as tumor metastasis. In this study, we proved that TAMs possess the ability to promote OS cell migration and invasion by upregulating COX-2, MMP9, and phosphorylated STAT3 and to induce the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This evidence has also been verified in a tumor-bearing animal model, and in OS patients. Furthermore, we observed the anti-metastasis effect of COX-2 inhibition by repressing COX-2 expression, EMT-activating transcription factors and the STAT3 pathway, both in vitro and in vivo.

METHODS: The expression of GPER in OS cells and tissues were checked. Its roles in cell migration and expression of Snail was checked by use of its agonist G-1.
RESULTS: We found that the expression of GPER in OS cells and tissues were lower than that in their corresponding controls. OS patients with higher levels of GPER showed increased overall survival rate (OS) as compared with the lower ones. The activator of GPER (G-1) or overexpression of GPER can inhibit the migration and invasion of OS cells and downregulate mesenchymal markers. G-1 can rapidly decrease the expression of Snail, one powerful epithelial-mesenchymal transition transcription factor (EMT-TF). Overexpression of Snail can attenuate the suppression effects of G-1 on migration of OS cells, suggesting that Snail was involved in GPER-regulated migration of OS cells. Mechanically, G-1 rapidly decreased the protein of Snail but had no effect on its mRNA expression. This was because G-1 can decrease the protein stability of Snail. Further, G-1 increased the expression of FBXL5, which can trigger the proteasome-mediated degradation of Snail. Knockdown of FBXL5 can reverse G-1-induced downregulation of Snail in OS cells.
CONCLUSION: Activation of GPER can suppress the migration and invasion of OS cells via FBXL5-mediated post-translational down regulation of Snail. It suggested that targeted activation of GPER might be a potent potential therapy approach to overcome the metastasis of OS patients.",J. Cancer Res. Clin.

30341066,TGFβ-Activated USP27X Deubiquitinase Regulates Cell Migration and Chemoresistance via Stabilization of Snail1.,"In cancer cells, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is controlled by Snail1, a transcriptional factor also required for the activation of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF). Snail1 is short-lived in normal epithelial cells as a consequence of its coordinated and continuous ubiquitination by several F-box-specific E3 ligases, but its degradation is prevented in cancer cells and in activated fibroblasts. Here, we performed an siRNA screen and identified USP27X as a deubiquitinase that increases Snail1 stability. Expression of USP27X in breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines and tumors positively correlated with Snail1 expression levels. Accordingly, downregulation of USP27X decreased Snail1 protein in several tumor cell lines. USP27X depletion impaired Snail1-dependent cell migration and invasion and metastasis formation and increased cellular sensitivity to cisplatin. USP27X was upregulated by TGFβ during EMT and was required for TGFβ-induced expression of Snail1 and other mesenchymal markers in epithelial cells and CAF. In agreement with this, depletion of USP27X prevented TGFβ-induced EMT and fibroblast activation. Collectively, these results indicate that USP27X is an essential protein controlling Snail1 expression and function and may serve as a target for inhibition of Snail1-dependent tumoral invasion and chemoresistance. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings show that inhibition of USP27X destabilizes Snail1 to impair EMT and renders tumor cells sensitive to chemotherapy, thus opening new strategies for the inhibition of Snail1 expression and its protumoral actions.",Cancer Res.,2019,"['Lambies G', 'Miceli M', 'Martínez-Guillamon C', 'Olivera-Salguero R', 'Peña R', 'Frías CP', 'Calderón I', 'Atanassov BS', 'Dent SYR', 'Arribas J', 'García de Herreros A', 'Díaz VM']",
30341010,Promoter Methylation-Regulated miR-145-5p Inhibits Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Progression by Targeting FSCN1.,"Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is a common form of head and neck cancer with poor prognosis. However, the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of LSCC remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated increased expression of fascin actin-bundling protein 1 (FSCN1) and decreased expression of microRNA-145-5p (miR-145-5p) in a clinical cohort of LSCC. Luciferase assay revealed that miR-145-5p is a negative regulator of FSCN1. Importantly, low miR-145-5p expression was correlated with TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) status and metastasis. Moreover, cases with low miR-145-5p/high FSCN1 expression showed poor prognosis, and these characteristics together served as independent prognostic indicators of survival. Gain- and loss-of-function studies showed that miR-145-5p overexpression or FSCN1 knockdown inhibited LSCC migration, invasion, and growth by suppressing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition along with inducing cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Additionally, hypermethylation of the miR-145-5p promoter suggested that repression of miR-145-5p arises through epigenetic inactivation. LSCC tumor growth in vivo could be inhibited by using miR-145-5p agomir or FSCN1 small interfering RNA (siRNA), which highlights the potential for clinical translation. Collectively, our findings indicate that miR-145-5p plays critical roles in inhibiting the progression of LSCC by suppressing FSCN1. Both miR-145-5p and FSCN1 are important potential prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for LSCC.",Mol.

The aim of the study is to investigate the clinical significance and underlying functions between miR-508-3p expression and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) development.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Quantitative Real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) was performed to determine the expression of miR-508-3p in 54 pairs of TNBC specimens and adjacent non-tumor tissues. The association between miR-508-3p expression and clinicopathological factors was assessed using x2-test. Transwell invasion assays were used to assess cell invasion ability. Luciferase reporter assay, Western blot analyses and qRT-PCR were performed to demonstrate ZEB1 was a direct target of miR-508-3p.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that miR-508-3p expression was remarkably decreased in TNBC tissues and cells. Lower miR-508-3p expression significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis in TNBC patients (p < 0.05). Ectopic expression of miR-508-3p significantly suppressed cell invasion ability of TNBC. MiR-508-3p overexpression suppressed cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenomenon of TNBC by upregulating E-cadherin expression, but downregulating Vimentin expression. In addition, we revealed that ZEB1 was a direct target of miR-508-3p in TNBC cells. MiR-508-3p significantly suppressed cell EMT process by regulating ZEB1 expression.

METHODS AND METHODS: A total of 54 glioma tissues and 12 normal brain tissues were collected. Human glioma cells (A172, SHG-44, T98, LN18, and LN229) and normal human astrocytes (NHAs) were cultured. Cell invasion and migration capacities were detected by transwell assay. KIF23 was predicted and confirmed as a direct target of miR-424 by TargetScan prediction and Dual-luciferase reporter assay. Six-week-old female nude mice were used for Xenograft tumor formation assay.
RESULTS: Results of this study demonstrated a significant decrease of miR-424 expressions both in glioma cells and tissues. Moreover, the declined miR-424 expressions were observed to be correlated with the poor OS and worse clinicopathological parameters of glioma patients. Functional assays indicated that miR-424 restoration could inhibit the glioma cell epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis, as well as the tumor growth rate and tumor size of glioma mice. Additionally, kinesin family member 23 (KIF23) expressions were found to be significantly enhanced in glioma specimens, and KIF23 was considered to be a functional target for miR-424 in glioma.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We detected the expressions of miR-30e-5p in NPC tissues, adjacent normal tissues, NPC cells (5-8F cells) and control cells (293T cells) by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The target gene of miR-30e-5p was predicted by online software and ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 (USP22) was screened out. Luciferase reporter gene assay was performed after NPC cells were co-transfected miR-30e-5p mimics or miR-30e-5p inhibitor and mutant-type or wild-type USP22, respectively. Expressions of miR-30e-5p and USP22 in 5-8F cells were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. The proliferation of 5-8F cells was measured by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay, and the invasion and migration abilities were detected by transwell assay. The activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was analyzed by detecting expressions of EMT-associated proteins (E-cadherin and Vimentin) in NPC cells.
RESULTS: Expression level of miR-30e-5p was remarkably reduced, while USP22 expression was elevated in NPC tissues and cells compared with the controls. Molecular mechanism analysis con-firmed that miR-30e-5p could negatively regulate mRNA and protein levels of USP22 by binding to its specific sequence of 3'UTR. Subsequent experiments showed that USP22 knockdown resulting from up-regulation of miR-30e-5p could inhibit proliferation, invasion, migration, and EMT in 5-8F cells.
CONCLUSIONS: MiR-30e-5p was lowly expressed in NPC by targeting USP22, suggesting that miR-30e-5p could be used as a potential therapeutic target for NPC.",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,2018,"['Ma YX', 'Zhang H', 'Li XH', 'Liu YH']",
30338801,LncRNA SBF2-AS1 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis by regulating EMT and predicts unfavorable prognosis.,"OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have furthered our understanding of the function of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in numerous biological processes, including cancer. The present study aimed to investigate the expression of lncRNA SBF2-AS1 (SBF2-AS1) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to investigate its effect on HCC cells.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we detected SBF2-AS1 expression in HCC cell lines and primary tumor tissues. The associations between SBF2-AS1 expression and the clinicopathological factors and outcome of HCC patients were statistically analyzed. MTT assay and transwell assay were performed to determine the proliferation, migration and invasion, respectively. In addition, we evaluated the activation of Mesenchymal-epithelial transition (EMT) pathway by Western blot.
RESULTS: We found that SBF2-AS1 expression levels were significantly up-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines compared with the corresponding noncancerous liver tissues and normal hepatic cell line. In addition, high SBF2-AS1 expression levels were correlated with vein invasion (p = 0.008) and TNM stage (p = 0.013). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that high expressions of SBF2-AS1 were correlated with shorter overall survival of HCC patients. Univariate and multivariate analysis identified high SBF2-AS1 expression as an unfavorable prognostic factor for overall survival. Further functional analysis demonstrated that knockdown of SBF2-AS1 significantly inhibited HCC cells proliferation, migration and invasion. Mechanistically, we found that SBF2-AS1 could promote the activation of EMT pathway, which was demonstrated by measuring the expression levels of EMT-related markers.
CONCLUSIONS: SBF2-AS1 might be considered as a novel molecule involved in HCC development, which provides a potential therapeutic target for HCC.",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,2018,"['Zhang YT', 'Li BP', 'Zhang B', 'Ma P', 'Wu QL', 'Ming L', 'Xie LM']",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: MicroRNA-19a-3p mimic and negative control plasmid were first constructed. After transfection of microRNA-19a-3p mimic or negative control in DU145 cells, expression levels of microRNA-19a-3p and SOX4 were detected by quantitative Real-time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. The regulatory effects of microRNA-19a-3p on migration and invasion of DU145 cells were detected by wound healing assay and transwell assay, respectively. Protein levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), N-cadherin, Vimentin, alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and E-cadherin in DU145 cells transfected with microRNA-19a-3p mimic or negative control were detected by Western blot.
RESULTS: Overexpression of microRNA-19a-3p inhibited protein level of SOX4 in DU145 cells. The migration and invasion of DU145 cells were inhibited after transfection of microRNA-19a-3p mimic. Protein levels of MMP2, MMP9, N-cadherin, Vimentin and α-SMA were downregulated, whereas E-cadherin was upregulated after microRNA-19a-3p overexpression.

30336197,Major vault protein is a direct target of Notch1 signaling and contributes to chemoresistance in triple-negative breast cancer cells.,"Resistance to chemotherapy remains a significant problem in the treatment of breast cancer, especially for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), in which standard systemic therapy is currently limited to chemotherapeutic agents. Our study aimed to better understand the molecular mechanisms that lead to failure of chemotherapy in TNBC. Herein, we observed elevated expression of Notch1 and major vault protein (MVP) in MDA-MB-231DDPR cells compared to their parental counterparts. We demonstrated that Notch1 could positively regulate the expression of MVP. Also, Notch1 intracellular domain (ICD) was capable of binding to CBF-1 on the promoter of MVP to drive its transcription, resulting in activation of AKT pathway and promoting the progress of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Conversely, silencing of Notch1 and MVP suppressed AKT pathway, reduced EMT and enhanced the sensitivity of TNBC cells to cisplatin and doxorubicin. Survival analysis indicated that the MVP was closely related to shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with TNBC. Collectively, this study provides evidence that Notch1 activates AKT pathway and promotes EMT partly through direct activation of MVP. Targeting Notch1/MVP pathway appears to have potential in overcoming chemoresistance in TNBC.",Cancer Lett.,2019,"['Xiao YS', 'Zeng', 'Liang YK', 'Wu Y', 'Li MF', 'Qi YZ', 'Wei XL', 'Huang WH', 'Chen M', 'Zhang GJ']",

Ubiquitin specific protease 4 (USP4), is involved in tumorigenesis by deubiquitinating some important oncogenic proteins and impacting their degradation. In the present study, we found that USP4 was significantly upregulated in HCC tumor tissues and the high expression of USP4 was associated with distant metastasis and poor survival in patients.

The present study was aimed to investigate the potential role and related mechanisms of GCN5 in IL-6-treated prostate cancer (PCa) cell. The results showed that an elevated GCN5 expression was stimulated by IL-6. Knockdown of GCN5 significantly inhibited IL-6-driven proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, early growth response-1 (Egr-1) expression was elevated by IL-6 treatment and GCN5 siRNA down-regulated the expression of Egr-1. Furthermore, overexpression of Egr-1 attenuated the effects of GCN5 silence on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT in PCa. Besides, knockdown of GCN5 resulted in the down-regulation of p-Akt and up-regulation of PTEN, which was partly impeded by Egr-1 overexpression. The effects of GCN5 overexpression on cell proliferation and invasion were suppressed by LY294002, In conclusion, these data demonstrated the negative effect of up-regulated GCN5 in IL-6-induced metastasis and EMT in PCa cells through PI3K/PTEN/Akt signaling pathway down-regulating Egr-1 expression.",Biosci.

Ldb1 knock down in murine fibroblasts activates SLK and enhances cell migration. To investigate the effect of Ldb1 deletion in ErbB2/HER2-driven tumorigenesis, Ldb1 conditional mice were crossed into MMTV-NIC mice, expressing the Neu oncogene and Cre recombinase from a bi-cistronic transgene. Our results show that Ldb1 is expressed in the mammary epithelium and that deletion of Ldb1 does not impair mammary gland development. Although high levels of Ldb1 can be correlated with poor prognosis in HER2+ breast cancers, Ldb1 ablation does not affect Neu-induced tumor progression in transgenic mice. Surprisingly, Ldb1 deletion did not affect SLK kinase activity in primary tumors or established cell lines. Nevertheless, Ldb1-deficient tumor cells showed enhanced mesenchymal and migratory characteristics in vitro. However, Ldb1-null cells failed to colonize the lungs of wildtype female mice when injected into the tail vein.

30324719,MYC and DNMT3A-mediated DNA methylation represses microRNA-200b in triple negative breast cancer.,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype with a poor prognosis. The microRNA-200 (miR-200) family has been associated with breast cancer metastasis. However, the epigenetic mechanisms underlying miR-200b repression in TNBC are not fully elucidated. In this study, we found that MYC proto-oncogene, bHLH transcription factor (MYC) and DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) were highly expressed in TNBC tissues compared with other breast cancer subtypes, while miR-200b expression was inhibited significantly. We demonstrated that MYC physically interacted with DNMT3A in MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MYC recruited DNMT3A to the miR-200b promoter, resulting in proximal CpG island hypermethylation and subsequent miR-200b repression. MiR-200b directly inhibited DNMT3A expression and formed a feedback loop in TNBC cells. MiR-200b overexpression synergistically repressed target genes including zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox factor 1, Sex determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2), and CD133, and inhibited the migration, invasion and mammosphere formation of TNBC cells.

30322398,Regulation of Sox2 and stemness by nicotine and electronic-cigarettes in non-small cell lung cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related deaths and its incidence is highly correlated with cigarette smoking. Nicotine, the addictive component of tobacco smoke, cannot initiate tumors, but can promote proliferation, migration, and invasion of cells in vitro and promote tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. This nicotine-mediated tumor promotion is facilitated through the activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), specifically the α7 subunit. More recently, nicotine has been implicated in promoting self-renewal of stem-like side-population cells from lung cancers. This subpopulation of cancer stem-like cells has been implicated in tumor initiation, generation of the heterogeneous tumor population, metastasis, dormancy, and drug resistance. Here we describe the molecular events driving nicotine and e-cigarette extract mediated stimulation of self-renewal of stem-like cells from non-small cell lung cancer.
METHODS: Experiments were conducted using A549 and H1650 non-small cell lung cancer cell lines and human mesenchymal stem cells according to protocols described in this paper. 2 μM nicotine or e-cigarette extracts was used in all relevant experiments. Biochemical analysis using western blotting, transient transfections, RT-PCR and cell biological analysis using double immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, as well as proximity ligation assays were conducted.
RESULTS: Here we demonstrate that nicotine can induce the expression of embryonic stem cell factor Sox2, which is indispensable for self-renewal and maintenance of stem cell properties in non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma (NSCLC) cells. We further demonstrate that this occurs through a nAChR-Yap1-E2F1 signaling axis downstream of Src and Yes kinases. Our data suggests Oct4 may also play a role in this process. Over the past few years, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have been promoted as healthier alternatives to traditional cigarette smoking as they do not contain tobacco; however, they do still contain nicotine. Hence we have investigated whether e-cigarette extracts can enhance tumor promoting properties similar to nicotine; we find that they can induce expression of Sox2 as well as mesenchymal markers and enhance migration and stemness of NSCLC cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings shed light on novel molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of smoking-related lung cancer in the context of cancer stem cell populations, and reveal new pathways involved that could potentially be exploited therapeutically.",Mol.

30321617,Protease-activated receptor 2 induces migration and promotes Slug-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition in lung adenocarcinoma cells.,"Protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2), a G protein-coupled receptor for trypsin, contributes to growth, anti-apoptosis, and migration in lung cancer. Given that PAR2 activation in airway epithelial cells compromises the airway epithelium barrier by disruption of E-cadherin adhesion, PAR2 may be involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Although PAR2 is known to promote the migration of lung cancer cells, the detailed mechanism of this event is still not clear. Here, we found that PAR2 is highly expressed in several lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. In two lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, CL1-5 and H1299 cells, activation of PAR2 induces migration and Slug-mediated EMT. The underlying mechanisms involved in PAR2-induced migration and EMT in CL1-5 cells were further investigated. We showed that PAR2-induced migration of CL1-5 cells is mediated by the Src/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) signaling pathway. β-arrestin 1, not G protein, is involved in this PAR2-mediated Src/p38 MAPK signaling pathway. PAR2-induced EMT in CL1-5 cells is dependent on the activation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2). The activation of ERK2 further mediates Slug stabilization through suppressing the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3β. In addition, a poor prognosis was observed in lung adenocarcinoma patients with a high expression of PAR2. Thus, PAR2 regulates migration through β-arrestin 1-dependent activation of p38 MAPK and EMT through ERK2-mediated stabilization of Slug in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Our finding also suggests that PAR2 might serve as a therapeutic target for metastatic lung adenocarcinoma and a potential biomarker for predicting the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma.",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Res,2019,"['Tsai CC', 'Chou YT', 'Fu HW']",
30321514,GLI1 promotes cancer stemness through intracellular signaling pathway PI3K/Akt/NFκB in colorectal adenocarcinoma.,"The role of Hedgehog (HH)/ glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1) pathway has been implicated in a variety of cancer entities, and the targeted pathway inhibition mediated by GLI1 is of therapeutic relevance. However, its oncogenicity and cross-talks with other cancer pathways including PI3K/Akt/NFκB, which modulates the HH/GLI1 signal strength, have rarely been explored in colorectal adenocarcinoma. We assessed the expression of GLI1 and its relationship with other cancer stemness genes, cell cycle markers, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), PI3K/Akt/NFκB signaling pathway genes, and HIF1α in 100 paraffin-embedded colorectal adenocarcinoma tissue samples using immunohistochemistry. We further addressed the effect of GLI1 on EMT, cell cycle, and its putative interaction with the PI3K/Akt/NFκB cascade in colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines. The expression of GLI1 in colorectal adenocarcinoma tissues was found to correlate with the clinical stages, and distant metastasis. Moreover, GLI1 was found to be an independent predictor of poor overall survival and disease-free survival in colorectal adenocarcinoma. GLI1-expressing cancer cells also expressed their representative cancer stem-like cell (CSC) markers (SOX9 and CD133), as well as HIF1α. GLI1 expression was also strongly linked to EMT-related and PI3K/Akt/NFκB signaling genes. Downregulation of GLI1 by inhibitor treatment in colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines resulted in reduced expression of CSC markers, cell clonogenicity, S-phase subpopulations, as well as the migration and invasion ability. Importantly, Akt inhibitor Perifosine significantly inhibited the expression of pAkt and GLI1 in colorectal adenocarcinoma cells. Combination of GLI1 inhibitor GANT61 and NFκB p65 inhibitor QZN exhibited much higher inhibition compared to using any of them individually on colorectal adenocarcinoma cells. We suggested that GLI1 may be a novel stem cell marker, and cancer stemness was activated via PI3K/Akt/NFκB pathway. In addition, co-targeting GLI1 and PI3K/Akt/NFκB signaling simultaneously might provide an alternative therapeutic strategy for colorectal adenocarcinoma patients.",Exp.

30320939,"Nuclear factor I/B promotes colorectal cancer cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and 5-fluorouracil resistance.","Nuclear factor I/B (NFIB) is a widely studied transcription factor that participates in tumor progression; nevertheless, studies on NFIB in colorectal cancer (CRC) are limited. In our study, Western blot and RT-PCR analyses showed that NFIB was overexpressed in CRC tissues and cell lines, which was consistent with our bioinformatic analysis results. Furthermore, NFIB expression was closely related to the TNM stage of CRC. NFIB promoted cell proliferation and migration and inhibited cell apoptosis in vitro. Meanwhile, we discovered that NFIB accelerated xenograft tumor growth in vivo. In addition, NFIB weakened the sensitivity of CRC cells to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). NFIB induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by upregulating snail expression, which was accompanied by decreased E-cadherin and Zo-1 expression and increasedd Vimentin expression. Because the Akt pathway plays an important role in CRC progression, we examined whether there was a correlation between NFIB and the Akt pathway in cell proliferation and migration. Our results showed that NFIB promoted cell proliferation and increased 5-FU resistance by activating the Akt pathway. In summary, our findings suggested that NFIB induced EMT of CRC cells via upregulating snail expression and promoted cell proliferation and 5-FU resistance by activating the Akt pathway.",Cancer Sci.,2019,"['Liu Z', 'Chen J', 'Yuan W', 'Ruan H', 'Shu Y', 'Ji J', 'Wu L', 'Tang Q', 'Zhou Z', 'Zhang X', 'Cheng Y', 'He S', 'Shu X']",
30320379,SOSTDC1 inhibits bone metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer and may serve as a clinical therapeutic target.,"Bone metastasis occurs in ~40% patients with non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), resulting in serious morbidity and mortality. Sclerostin domain‑containing protein 1 (SOSTDC1) has been demonstrated to be associated with the development and progression of multiple types of cancer. However, the role of SOSTDC1 in NSCLC bone metastasis remains unclear. In the present study, it was identified that SOSTDC1 was downregulated in NSCLC bone metastatic lesions compared with that in primary tumors, and low SOSTDC1 expression predicted poor prognosis for patients with NSCLC. Functionally, SOSTDC1 overexpression suppressed NSCLC cell proliferation, migration, invasion and cancer cell‑induced osteoclastogenesis, while SOSTDC1 knockdown produced the opposite effect. In addition, a number of potential downstream target genes of SOSTDC1, which were demonstrated to be associated with tumor progression and bone metastasis, were identified in NSCLC cells by RNA deep sequencing and RT‑qPCR assays. The results from the present study may provide useful insight for an improved understanding of the pathogenesis of NSCLC bone metastasis, and suggest that SOSTDC1 may be a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for NSCLC bone metastasis.",Int.

30320342,Ginkgolic acid suppresses the invasion of HepG2 cells via downregulation of HGF/c‑Met signaling.,"Liver cancer is one of the most devastating types of cancer worldwide. Despite years of improvements in treatment, the prognosis of patients with this type of malignancy remains poor due to frequent recurrence and metastasis after surgical resection. Ginkgolic acid (GA) is a botanical drug extracted from the seed coat of Ginkgo biloba L. that possesses a wide range of bioactive properties. However, to the best of our knowledge, whether GA can inhibit the invasion of liver cancer cells and the underlying mechanisms remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of GA on the migration and invasion abilities of liver cancer cells and the underlying molecular mechanism. The results revealed that GA suppressed the migration and invasion abilities of HepG2 cells. In addition, GA treatment inhibited the expression of invasion‑related molecules (MMP‑2 and MMP‑9) and prevented the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) of HepG2 cells. Further experiments revealed that GA‑reduced hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) production and suppressed c‑Met phosphorylation may be the underlying mechanisms. Exogenous recombinant HGF supplementation improved the cell invasion ability impaired by GA. Moreover, the in vivo experiment revealed that GA inhibited the tumor growth of liver cancer and prevented EMT. Collectively, these data indicated that GA effectively suppressed the invasion and EMT of HepG2 cells via downregulation of HGF/c‑Met signaling, thus GA may serve as a novel chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of HCC.",Oncol.

30320132,The Oncogenic Role of ARG1 in Progression and Metastasis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"ARG1, which encodes Arginase1, is expressed in the liver cytoplasm and plays a major role in the hepatic urea cycle. The past research works shed light on the fact that ARG1 participates in anti-inflammation, tumor immunity, and immunosuppression-related diseases. Nevertheless, the concrete role and clinical significance of ARG1 in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. Herein, we aimed at examining the expression and clinicopathological significance of ARG1 in HCC, together with determining the effect of ARG1 on the progression and metastasis of HCC. In the current study, evaluation of the expression of ARG1 and clinicopathological significance of ARG1 was carried out in the human HCC tissues microarray, and the ARG1 overexpression vector and shRNA-ARG1 plasmids were constructed for the assessment of the concrete effect of ARG1 on cellular behaviors of Huh7 cells. As our data revealed, ARG1 was significantly downregulated in HCC, and the higher expression of ARG1 was positively correlated with more aggressive tumor growth, size, ALT, and GGT level. Significantly, we found that the high expression of ARG1 was correlated with poor DFS of HCC patients. Besides, in vitro study revealed that overexpression of ARG1 could enhance arginase activity, cell viability, migration, and invasion of Huh7 cells, and loss-of-function of ARG1 by shRNA interference could inhibit these cellular behaviors. Additionally, overexpression of ARG1 led to a significant increase in the expression of Vimentin, N-cadherin, and ",Biomed Res Int,2018,"['You J', 'Chen W', 'Chen J', 'Zheng Q', 'Dong J', 'Zhu Y']",
30318866,Vasohibin 2 promotes malignant behaviors of pancreatic cancer cells by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition via Hedgehog signaling pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Based on previous findings, we hypothesized that Vasohibin 2 (VASH2) protein may induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of pancreatic cancer (PC) cells by promoting the malignant behaviors of these cells. The present study aimed to test this hypothesis and explore the possible mechanisms involved.
METHODS: The expression of VASH2 in PC tissues and cell lines was detected by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot. PC cells with overexpression or knockdown of VASH2 were used to examine the involvement of VASH2 in EMT by detecting the expression of epithelial (E-cadherin) and mesenchymal (vimentin) markers and EMT-related transcription factor ZEB1/2, in gemcitabine resistance and tumor cell invasion by apoptosis and invasion assays, and in cancer stem cell-like phenotypes by detecting the proportion of CD24
RESULTS: We found that VASH2 was highly expressed in PC tissues and cells. It promoted the EMT of PC cells by altering ZEB1/2 expression. VASH2 also stimulated invasion and chemotherapeutic resistance of PC cells and increased the proportion of cancer stem-like cells in PC cells. VASH2 did so by upregulating the expression of multiple molecules in the Hedgehog signaling pathway of PC cells.
CONCLUSION: VASH2 promotes malignant behaviors of PC cells by inducing EMT via activation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway.",Cancer Med,2018,"['Zhang Y', 'Xue X', 'Zhao X', 'Qin L', 'Shen Y', 'Dou H', 'Sun J', 'Wang T', 'Yang DQ']",
30315187,Cytopathological Study of the Circulating Tumor Cells filtered from the Cancer Patients' Blood using Hydrogel-based Cell Block Formation.,"Circulating tumor cells have emerged as biomarkers for estimating the tumor burden and metastatic potential of cancer patients. However, to date, most of studies and applications of circulating tumor cells have been conducted and applied to epithelial cancers such as breast, colorectal, and prostate tumor. The only FDA-cleared method, CellSearch, makes use of antibody against epithelial surface protein expressed on CTCs, thus obstructing wide application for various cancers with non-epithelial and semi-epithelial characteristics including renal cell carcinoma. Due to rarity and ambiguity of CTCs, designed experiment including non-biased CTC isolation and subsequent cytopathological study for finding applicable immunomarkers are urgently needed for clinical use of CTCs for less-studied cancers. Here, in order to construct the fundamental step for CTC diagnosis without limitation of its epithelial characteristics, we present the simple and novel method which incorporate both label-free CTC isolation and pathological study using hydrogel-based cell block formation. Six cell lines from lung, ovarian, kidney cancers were used to make cell block and analyzed by conventional immunocytochemical staining method to find the candidate markers for CTC. Especially for renal cancer, the physically isolated CTCs were further immunocytochemically examined with the screened candidate markers by cell block construction, and verified their clinical utility using blood samples from patients with renal cell carcinoma. This comprehensive study demonstrates that the present approach can be used to find the potential markers for any type of cancers regardless of their epithelial characteristics and isolate the specific type of CTCs in label-free manners.",Sci Rep,2018,"['Kang YT', 'Kim YJ', 'Lee TH', 'Cho YH', 'Chang HJ', 'Lee HM']",

Recently, microRNAs (miRs) have been intensively investigated due to their potential usefulness from a tumor treatment perspective.
AIMS: The current study was aimed to investigate whether miR-494 influences epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), tumor growth and metastasis of CCA.
METHODS: The regulatory miRNAs of WDHD1 in CCA expression chip were predicted, followed by determination of the miR-494 and WDHD1 expression in normal cholangiocyte tissues and CCA tissues. The related protein levels were determined. CCA cell migration, invasion, viability, and cell cycle distribution and the dosage-dependent effect of miR-494 on CCA cell growth were subsequently detected. Finally, tumorigenicity and lymph node metastasis (LNM) were measured.
RESULTS: Initially, miR-194 affected the CCA development via negatively regulating WDHD1 and miR-494 which were downregulated while WDHD1 was upregulated in CCA. In addition, miR-494 overexpression elevated E-cadherin expression while decreased expressions of WDHD1, N-cadherin, Vimentin, Snail, Twist and MMP-9. Finally, overexpressed miR-494 was observed to suppress EMT, cell viability, migration, invasion, arrest cell cycle progression, tumor formation, and LNM while accelerating cell apoptosis in vivo.

30312171,CLCA4 inhibits cell proliferation and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma by suppressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition via PI3K/AKT signaling.,"Calcium activated Chloride Channel A4 (CLCA4), as a tumor suppressor, was reported to contribute to the progression of several malignant tumors, yet little is known about the significance of CLCA4 in invasion and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). CLCA4 expression was negatively correlated with tumor size, vascular invasion and TNM stage. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that CLCA4 was an independent predictor for overall survival (OS) and time to recurrence (TTR). In addition, CLCA4 status could act as prognostic predictor in different risk of subgroups. Moreover, combination of CLCA4 and serum AFP could be a potential predictor for survival in HCC patients. Furthermore, CLCA4 may inhibit cell migration and invasion by suppressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via PI3K/ATK signaling. Knockdown of CLCA4 significantly increased the migration and invasion of HCC cells and changed the expression pattern of EMT markers and PI3K/AKT phosphorylation. An opposite expression pattern of EMT markers and PI3K/AKT phosphorylation was observed in CLCA4-transfected cells. Additionally, immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR results further confirmed this correlation. Taken together, CLCA4 contributes to migration and invasion by suppressing EMT via PI3K/ATK signaling and predicts favourable prognosis of HCC. CLCA4/AFP expression may help to distinguish different risks of HCC patients after hepatectomy.",Aging (Albany NY),2018,"['Liu Z', 'Chen M', 'Xie LK', 'Liu T', 'Zou ZW', 'Li Y', 'Chen P', 'Peng X', 'Ma C', 'Zhang WJ', 'Li PD']",
30311406,Tumor-driven like macrophages induced by conditioned media from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma promote tumor metastasis via secreting IL-8.,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are abundant population of inflammatory cells which play an essential role in remodeling tumor microenvironment and tumor progression. Previously, we found the high density of TAMs was correlated with lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the mechanisms of interaction between TAMs and PDAC. THP-1 monocytes were the exposure to conditioned media (CM) produced by PDAC cells; then, monocyte recruitment and macrophage differentiation were assessed. CM from PDAC attracted and polarized THP-1 monocytes to tumor-driven like macrophages. mRNA expression cytokine profiling and ELISA identified the IL-8 secretion was increasing in tumor-driven like macrophages, and STAT3 pathway was involved. Addition of exogenous recombinant human IL-8 promoted PDAC cells motility in vitro and metastasis in vivo via upregulating Twist expression, which mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer cells. What is more, IL-8 expression level in tumor stroma by immunohistochemical analysis was related to lymph node metastasis, the number of tumor CD68 but not CD163 positive macrophages and patient outcome. Taken together, these findings shed light on the important interplay between cancer cells and TAMs in tumor microenvironment and suggested that IL-8 signaling might be a potential therapeutic target for PDAC.",Cancer Med,2018,"['Chen SJ', 'Lian GD', 'Li JJ', 'Zhang QB', 'Zeng LJ', 'Yang KG', 'Huang CM', 'Li YQ', 'Chen YT', 'Huang KH']",

METHODS: Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), western blot, cell viability, transwell migration and invasion, tumor spheres formation and in vivo tumor formation assays were used to examine the effects of FUS on HCC progression in HuH7 and MHCC97 cells. Additionally, transcriptome analysis based on RNA-sequencing data, qRT-PCR, western blots, luciferase reporter and RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays were used to explore the LATS1/2 (large tumor suppressor kinases 1/2)-related mechanisms contributing to FUS functions. Finally, qRT-PCR and western blot analysis were used to detect the levels of FUS and LATS1/2 in HCC and adjacent normal tissues, and the correlation between them in HCC tissues.
RESULTS: Overexpression of FUS decreased cell viability, migration, invasion and stemness. Moreover, FUS interacted and stabilized LATS1/2 stability, and thus promoted LATS1/2 expression and activated Hippo pathway. Finally, FUS and LAST1/2 levels were positively correlated and significantly down-regulated in HCC tissues.

Till now, the mechanisms underlying CDC27-induced the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of GC are still unclear.
METHODS: We analyzed the expression levels of CDC27 and EMT-related biomarkers using immunohistochemistry and Western blot in 60 cases of GC tissues, and then GC cells with CDC27 shRNAs or plasmids were subjected to in vitro and in vivo assays, including CCK-8, wound healing and transwell assays.
RESULTS: The CDC27 expression was obviously increased in GC tissues, and significantly correlates with EMT-related biomarkers, lymph node metastasis and poor 5-year overall survival. Additionally, in vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated that silencing of CDC27 expression effectively inhibited GC cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis. Conversely, CDC27 overexpression led to the opposite results. Finally, we demonstrated that Twist shRNA inhibited CDC27-meditated invasion and EMT of GC cells.

30308493,High Glucose Promotes Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition of Uterus Endometrial Cancer Cells by Increasing ER/GLUT4-Mediated VEGF Secretion.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Uterus endometrial cancer (UEC) is the common malignancy among gynecologic cancers, and most of them are type I estrogen-dependent UEC. Diabetes is well-known risk factor for the development of UEC. However, the underlying link between high glucose (HG) and the estrogen receptor in UEC remains unclear. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has also been shown to occur during the initiation of metastasis in cancer progression. The aim of this study was to determine the relationships and roles of HG, estrogen receptor and EMT in the growth and migration of UEC.
METHODS: The expression of glucose transport protein 4 (GLUT4) in the control endometrium and UEC tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC); the cell viability and invasion were analyzed through CCK-8 and Matrigel invasion assays; the transcriptional level of EMT-related genes was evaluated through real-time PCR; and the effect of HG and / or GLUT4 on estrogen receptors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor VEGFR was analyzed through western blotting, ELISA and flow cytometry (FCM) assay, respectively. In addition, Ishikawa-xenografted nude mice were constructed and were used to analyze the effect of estrogen and GLUT4 on the growth of UEC in vivo.
RESULTS: Here, we found that exposure to HG led to a high level of viability and invasion of UEC cell lines (UECC, Ishikawa and RL95-2 cells). Compared with the normal endometrium, a higher level of GLUT4 was observed in UEC tissues. Silencing GLUT4 obviously inhibited the HG-promoted viability, invasion and expression of EMT-related genes (TWIST, SNAIL and CTNNB1) of UECC promoted by HG. Further analysis showed that HG and GLUT4 promoted the secretion of VEGF and expression of VEGFR in UECC. Treatment with HG led to the increase of estrogen receptor α (ERα) and β (ERβ) in UECC, blocking ERα or ERβ resulted in the decreases in GLUT4 expression, TWIST, SNAIL and CTNNB1 transcription, and VEGF and VEGFR expression in UECC. Treatment with anti-human VEGF neutralizing antibody restricted the viability and invasion of UECC that was induced by HG and estrogen. Exposure to estrogen accelerated growth, VEGF production, and TWIST and CTNNB1 expression in UEC in Ishikawa-xenografted nude mice, and silencing GLUT4 restricted these effects.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that HG increases GLUT4 and VEGF/VEGFR expression, further promotes EMT process and accelerates the development of UEC by up-regulating ER.",Cell. Physiol. Biochem.,2018,"['Gu CJ', 'Xie F', 'Zhang B', 'Yang HL', 'Cheng J', 'He YY', 'Zhu XY', 'Li DJ', 'Li MQ']",

Although inhibition of the mTOR pathway is known to be the most important mechanism for the antitumor effects of metformin, other mechanisms remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to identify the antitumor mechanism of metformin in colorectal cancer using high-throughput data, and then test the mechanism experimentally. We identified the gene signature of metformin-treated colon cancer cells. This signature was processed for prediction using colon adenocarcinoma patient data from the Cancer Genome Atlas to classify the patients showing a gene expression pattern similar to that in metformin-treated cells. This patient group showed better overall and disease-free survival. Furthermore, pathway analysis revealed that the metformin-predicted group was characterized by decreased interleukin (IL)-6 pathway signaling, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and colon cancer metastatic signaling. We induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in colon cancer cell lines via IL-6 treatment, which increased cell motility and promoted invasion. However, these effects were blocked by metformin. These findings suggest that blockade of IL-6-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition is an antitumor mechanism of metformin.",PLoS ONE,2018,"['Kang S', 'Kim BR', 'Kang MH', 'Kim DY', 'Lee DH', 'Oh SC', 'Min BW', 'Um JW']",

Though significant progress has been made in the availability of diagnostic techniques and treatment strategies, pancreatic cancer remains a disease of high mortality rate. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that governs the oncogenesis and metastasis process of pancreatic cancer. In the present study, by using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset analysis, we demonstrated that sorting nexin 6 (SNX6) serves as a biomarker for predicting prognosis of pancreatic cancer. In vitro studies demonstrated that silencing of SNX6 expression reduced cell proliferation, colony formation, invasion, and metastasis. Higher level of SNX6 helps maintain the mesenchymal properties, which renders migration and invasive capacities to pancreatic cancer cells. Moreover, in the process of TGF-β-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), the expression level of SNX6 was increased, and silencing of SNX6 expression could inhibit the TGF-β-induced EMT program.

30306401,HER2 in stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity of breast cancer.,"Breast cancer had been the first non-hematologic malignancy where sub-types based on molecular characterization had entered clinical practice. HER2 over-expression, due to either gene amplification or protein up-regulation, defines one of these sub-types and is clinically exploited by addition of HER2-targeted treatments to the regimens of treatment. Nevertheless, in many occasions HER2-positive cancers are resistant or become refractory to these therapies. Several mechanisms, such as activation of alternative pathways or loss of expression of the receptor in cancer cells, have been proposed as the cause of these therapeutic failures. Cancer stem cells (CSCs, alternatively called tumor-initiating cells) comprise a small percentage of the tumor cells, but are capable of reconstituting and propagating tumors due to their superior intrinsic capacity for regeneration, survival and resistance to therapies. CSCs possess circuits enabling epigenetic plasticity which endow them with the ability to alternate between epithelial and mesenchymal states. This paper will discuss the expression and regulation of HER2 in CSCs of the different sub-types of breast cancer and relationships of the receptor with both the circuits of stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity.

However, the role of circRNAs in cancer cells epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify novel circRNAs that regulate urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) cells' EMT and explored their regulatory mechanisms and clinical significance in UCBs.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We first screened circRNA expression profiles using a circRNA microarray in paired UCB and normal tissues, and then studied the clinical significance of an upregulated circRNA, circPRMT5, in a large cohort of patients with UCB. We further investigated the functions and underlying mechanisms of circPRMT5 in UCB cells' EMT. Moreover, we evaluated the regulation effect of circPRMT5 on miR-30c, and its target genes, 
RESULTS: We demonstrated that upregulated expression of circPRMT5 was positively associated with advanced clinical stage and worse survival in patients with UCB. We further revealed that circPRMT5 promoted UCB cell's EMT via sponging miR-30c. Clinical analysis from two independent UCB cohorts showed that the circPRMT5/miR-30c/SNAIL1/E-cadherin pathway was essential in supporting UCB progression. Importantly, we identified that circPRMT5 was upregulated in serum and urine exosomes from patients with UCB, and significantly correlated with tumor metastasis.

However, development of drug resistance remains the major therapeutic barrier in NSCLC.
METHODS: The potential cisplatin resistance-related genes were identified from the global transcriptomes of cisplatin-resistant A549/DDP cells using microarray analysis. Gain- and loss-of-function assays were performed to analyze the effects of Forkhead Box Protein C2 (FOXC2) on the in vitro and in vivo sensitivity of NSCLC cells to cisplatin and its possible molecular mechanisms.
RESULTS: Using global transcriptome analysis, we found that FOXC2 was one of the most upregulated molecules in A549/DDP cells compared with A549 cells. We further confirmed that the expression of FOXC2 was significantly increased in cisplatin-resistant NSCLC tissues. FOXC2 knockdown significantly increased the in vitro and in vivo sensitivity of A549/DDP cells to cisplatin, whereas overexpression of FOXC2 increased cisplatin resistance in cisplatin-sensitive NSCLC cells. Moreover, we found that FOXC2 promoted cisplatin resistance by induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in NSCLC cells. Furthermore, FOXC2 activated the AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway, and then increased the protein expression of EMT-related transcription factor Snail. Inhibition of AKT or knockdown of Snail reversed FOXC2-induced EMT and cisplatin resistance of NSCLC cells.
CONCLUSION: FOXC2 enhanced cisplatin resistance of NSCLC cells through activating AKT/GSK3β/Snail/EMT signaling pathway, which may be a potential novel therapeutic target for overcoming drug resistance in human NSCLCs.",Cancer Chemother.

30301907,CHI3L1 promotes tumor progression by activating TGF-β signaling pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"CHI3L1 (YKL40) is a secreted glycoprotein and elevated serum CHI3L1 level has been proved to be associated with poor prognosis in many human cancers. However, the mechanism of how CHI3L1 causes poor prognosis in cancers is still unknown. Here, considering that CHI3L1 is a liver specific/enriched protein, we use hepatocellular carcinoma as a model to study the function of CHI3L1. We showed that, both in vivo and in vitro, overexpression of CHI3L1 could promote liver cancer cells growth, migration and invasion. We then used RNA-seq to analyze the expression profiles of CHI3L1 overexpressed in two HCC cell lines and found that CHI3L1 overexpression affected genes that were involved in cell-cell adhesion, extracellular exosome and adherens junction. Western blot analysis further revealed that CHI3L1 could activate TGF-β signal pathways. Our data added new understanding of the mechanism of CHI3L1's action. 1) CHI3L1 promoted cancer cell proliferation by regulating cell cycles; 2) CHI3L1 promoted cancer cell invasion and metastasis; 3) CHI3L1 regulate liver cancer potentially by regulating the TGF-β signaling pathways; 4) CHI3L1 has direct kinase activities or activate kinase to phosphorylate SMAD2, SMAD3.",Sci Rep,2018,"['Qiu QC', 'Wang L', 'Jin SS', 'Liu GF', 'Liu J', 'Ma L', 'Mao RF', 'Ma YY', 'Zhao N', 'Chen M', 'Lin BY']",
30301213,"Role of Hypoxic Stress in Regulating Tumor Immunogenicity, Resistance and Plasticity.","Hypoxia, or gradients of hypoxia, occurs in most growing solid tumors and may result in pleotropic effects contributing significantly to tumor aggressiveness and therapy resistance. Indeed, the generated hypoxic stress has a strong impact on tumor cell biology. For example, it may contribute to increasing tumor heterogeneity, help cells gain new functional properties and/or select certain cell subpopulations, facilitating the emergence of therapeutic resistant cancer clones, including cancer stem cells coincident with tumor relapse and progression. It controls tumor immunogenicity, immune plasticity, and promotes the differentiation and expansion of immune-suppressive stromal cells. In this context, manipulation of the hypoxic microenvironment may be considered for preventing or reverting the malignant transformation. Here, we review the current knowledge on how hypoxic stress in tumor microenvironments impacts on tumor heterogeneity, plasticity and resistance, with a special interest in the impact on immune resistance and tumor immunogenicity.",Int J Mol Sci,2018,"['Terry S', 'Faouzi Zaarour R', 'Hassan Venkatesh G', 'Francis A', 'El-Sayed W', 'Buart S', 'Bravo P', 'Thiery J', 'Chouaib S']",

Its pharmacologic mechanism, however, still remained to be further clarified. In this study, we demonstrated that oleanolic acid attenuated the migration and invasion abilities, resulting in the suppression of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in liver cancer cells, and inhibited the tumor growth of the peritoneal lymphocytes-bearing mice. We further proved that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) may be the potential target of oleanolic acid. We confirmed that oleanolic acid could promote the dimerization of iNOS, activating it, and subsequently increasing the production of nitric oxide. Further experiments indicated that oleanolic acid promoted the nitration of specific proteins and consequently suppressed their EMT-related biological functions. Furthermore, it has been confirmed that oleanolic acid enhanced the antitumor effects of regorafenib in liver cancer treatment. These results deepened our understanding of the pharmacologic mechanism of the antitumor effect oleanolic acid, and the importance of nitric oxide synthetase as a therapeutic target for liver cancer treatment.",Mol.

30296782,The Anticancer Effect of Huaier Extract in Renal Cancer 786-O Cells.,"BACKGROUND: Trametes robiniophila Murr (Huaier) has been used as an adjuvant therapy of tumor in traditional Chinese medicine for many years, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. In the present study, we tested the inhibitory effect of Huaier extract on renal cancer 786-O cells and explored the possible mechanisms.
METHODS: 786-O cells were treated by gradient concentrations of Huaier extract, cell viability, invasion, migration and apoptosis were assessed by cell counting kit 8, cell scratch, transwell, and flow cytometry assay in vitro. The changes in protein level were detected by western blot analysis. Finally, the anticancer effect of Huaier was tested in vivo by nude mouse tumorigenicity assay.
RESULTS: Viability of 786-O cells was suppressed by Huaier in a time- and dose-dependent manner; cell invasion and migration were also dramatically inhibited. Flow cytometry assays showed that Huaier could induce cell apoptosis. Western blotting analysis indicated that Huaier suppressed the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR/p70S6K/4E-BP1 signaling pathway. We also found that Huaier could partly reverse the epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) process. In vivo experiment indicated that tumor growth in the xenograft mouse model was suppressed by Huaier.
CONCLUSION: Huaier plays an anticancer effect partially through the suppression of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/p70S6K/4E-BP1 pathway and by reversing the EMT process. Huaier may act as an effective agent for treating renal cell carcinoma.",Pharmacology,2018,"['Wei C', 'Liu Z', 'Li L', 'Zhang Y', 'Fang Z', 'Fan Y']",

The aim of this study is to identify candidate genes by bioinformatics and investigate its clinical pathological characters and prognostic significance.
METHOD: First, we identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in CRC by analyzing gene expression datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Then we performed a bioinformatics analysis by using Oncomine, STRING and Oncolnc databases. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed using TCGA data set. Then, the protein expression level of PPP2CA was detected by immunohistochemistry in 196 pairs of primary colorectal cancer and corresponding non-tumor tissues.
RESULT: Total 81 differential expressed genes were identified in the overlap of datasets. PPI network show the hub genes were CCND1, PPP2CA and YAP1. We investigated Oncomine databases and found that PPP2CA mRNA expression was lower in CRC tissues compared with normal tissues. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that PPP2CA expression was associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition signaling pathway. Low expression of PPP2CA was associated with T stage, N stage, and M stage. Low expression of PPP2CA was associated with worse overall survival for CRC, and retained significance as an independent prognostic factor for CRC.
CONCLUSION: PPP2CA may act as an oncogene in the progression of colorectal cancer. Moreover, PPP2CA has potential to be used as prognostic markers or therapeutic targets in CRC.",Int J Surg,2018,"['Yong L', 'YuFeng Z', 'Guang B']",
30296500,Cofilin-1 signaling mediates epithelial-mesenchymal transition by promoting actin cytoskeleton reorganization and cell-cell adhesion regulation in colorectal cancer cells.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is frequently a lethal disease because of metastasis. Actin cytoskeletal rearrangement is an essential step in cell migration during activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program, which is associated with metastatic properties of cancer cells. Cofilin-1 protein modulates actin dynamics by promoting actin treadmilling, thereby driving membrane protrusion and cell migration and invasion. However, the role of cofilin-1 during EMT in CRC is unknown. Here, we show that cofilin-1 and p-cofilin-1 have distinct subcellular distribution in EMT cells, as determined by super-resolution microscopy images, indicating distinct roles in different areas of cells. Silenced cofilin-1 cells treated with TGF-β (siCofilin-1/TGF-β) evaded p-LIMK2-p-cofilin-1 status, leading to recovery of E-cadherin and claudin-3 at the cell-cell contact and their respective protein levels, actin reorganization, and decreased mesenchymal protein level. Furthermore, siCofilin-1/TGF-β cells exhibited decreased migration and invasion rates as well as MMP-2 and -9 activity and augmented focal adhesion size. The expression of an inactive phospho-cofilin-1 mimetic (S3E) reduced E-cadherin and claudin-3 in cell-cell contacts, reduced their protein levels, and increased vimentin protein. Based on our findings, we suggest that cofilin-1 is crucial to switching from epithelial to mesenchymal-like morphology and cell migration and invasion by regulating actin cytoskeleton organization through activation of RhoA-LIMK2-cofilin-1 signaling, impacting the cell-cell adhesion organization of colon cancer cells in EMT.",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Res,2019,"['Sousa-Squiavinato ACM', 'Rocha MR', 'Barcellos-de-Souza P', 'de Souza WF', 'Morgado-Diaz JA']",

Ethanol is a well-known risk factor for HCC; it promotes the progression and aggressiveness of HCC. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In clinic studies, we showed that alcohol consumption is positively correlated with TNM stage and vessel invasion; HCC patients with chronic drinking history had faster progression rate and poorer prognosis compared to non-drinkers. In experimental models, ethanol exposure enhanced the metastasis, and invasion of HCC cells. Ethanol exposure increased cancer stem cells (CSC) population and enhanced stemness of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, we found that ethanol exposure induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) through activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in HCC cells. We further demonstrated that β-catenin siRNA or salinomycin (an inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin pathway) partially rescued ethanol-induced EMT. In conclusion, this study suggested that ethanol exposure promotes the metastasis and stemness of HCC cells by inducing EMT.",Mol.

30294913,The long non-coding RNA MALAT1 promotes ovarian cancer progression by regulating RBFOX2-mediated alternative splicing.,"Ovarian cancer metastasizes via direct seeding, whereby cancer cells shed from the primary site, resist cell death in the peritoneal cavity, then metastasize to peritoneal organs. We sought to identify molecular mechanisms that facilitate ovarian cancer cell anchorage independent survival. Gene expression profiling was performed on ovarian cancer cells grown in attached or forced suspension culture and confirmed by RT-qPCR. Anoikis was measured by Caspase 3/7 assay. Since the long non-coding RNA Metastasis Associated Lung Adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) was among the transcripts most highly increased in forced suspension culture, modified anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASO) were used to inhibit its expression. Knockdown of RBFOX2 and KIF1B was performed using shRNAs. Publically available datasets were analyzed for association of MALAT1 gene expression with clinicopathological variables. In multiple anoikis-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines MALAT1 expression increased after 24 and 48 h in forced suspension culture compared to attached culture. High MALAT1 is associated with increased stage, recurrence, and reduced survival in ovarian cancer, and in a small percentage of ovarian cancers MALAT1 is amplified. MALAT1 knockdown resulted in decreased proliferation, invasion, anchorage-independent growth, and increased anoikis. Suppression of MALAT1 also resulted in decreased expression of RBFOX2, and alternative processing of the pro-apoptotic tumor suppressor gene KIF1B. RBFOX2 suppression resulted in preferential splicing of the pro-apoptotic isoform of KIF1B (KIFB1B-beta) and increased anoikis. The lncRNA MALAT1 facilitates a pro-metastatic phenotype in ovarian cancer by promoting alternative RNA processing and differential expression of anti-apoptosis and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes.",Mol.

We tried to construct a novel therapeutic strategy to conquer the resistance to second-and third-generation EGFR-TKIs in EGFR-positive NSCLC patients. We established afatinib- and osimertinib-resistant lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. Exome sequencing, cDNA array and miRNA microarray were performed using the established cell lines to discover novel therapeutic targets associated with the resistance to second-and third-generation EGFR-TKIs. We found that ANKRD1 which is associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenomenon and anti-apoptosis, was overexpressed in the second-and third-generation EGFR-TKIs-resistant cells at the mRNA and protein expression levels. When ANKRD1 was silenced in the EGFR-TKIs-resistant cell lines, afatinib and osimertinib could induce apoptosis of the cell lines. Imatinib could inhibit ANKRD1 expression, resulting in restoration of the sensitivity to afatinib and osimertinib of EGFR-TKI-resistant cells. In EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients, ANKRD1 was overexpressed in the tumor after the failure of EGFR-TKI therapy, especially after long-duration EGFR-TKI treatments.

We here investigate a role of CBP/p300-interacting transactivator with E/D-rich carboxy-terminal domain-2 (CITED2) in prostate cancer metastasis. CITED2 is highly expressed in metastatic prostate cancer, and its expression is correlated with poor survival. The CITED2 gene is highly activated by ETS-related gene that is overexpressed due to chromosomal translocation. CITED2 acts as a molecular chaperone to guide PRMT5 and p300 to nucleolin, thereby activating nucleolin. Informatics and experimental data suggest that the CITED2-nucleolin axis is involved in prostate cancer metastasis. This axis stimulates cell migration through the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and promotes cancer metastasis in a xenograft mouse model. Our results suggest that CITED2 plays a metastasis-promoting role in prostate cancer and thus could be a target for preventing prostate cancer metastasis.",Nat Commun,2018,"['Shin SH', 'Lee GY', 'Lee M', 'Kang J', 'Shin HW', 'Chun YS', 'Park JW']",

New targets and new targeted therapeutic drugs for TNBC are desperately needed. Our study confirmed that DCC-2036 inhibited the proliferation, invasion, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of TNBC cells as well as induced apoptosis. Moreover, the antiproliferative activity of DCC-2036 was more efficient than that of most clinical drugs. In addition, the combination of DCC-2036 and cisplatin or lapatinib had synergistic effects on TNBC cells. Mechanistically, DCC-2036 targeted AXL/MET, especially AXL, and regulated the downstream PI3K/Akt-NFκB signaling to exert its antitumor effect in TNBC. DCC-2036 also inhibited the growth and metastasis of xenografted MDA-MB-231 cells (AXL/MET-high TNBC cells) but not MDA-MB-468 cells (AXL-low TNBC cells) in NSG mice in vivo. Furthermore, DCC-2036 significantly inhibited tumor growth and invasion of AXL/MET-high TNBC PDX tumors but not AXL/MET-low TNBC PDX tumors. These results highlighted the roles of AXL/MET in cancer growth and metastasis and further verified that the critical targets of DCC-2036 are AXL and MET, especially AXL. In addition, there was no significant toxicity of DCC-2036 even at a high dosage.

Herein, we aimed to dissect its potential dual relevance in prostate cancer (PCa). ALDH1 expression was evaluated immunohistochemically in tumor and stromal cells in primary PCa and metastases. It was correlated to clinico-pathologic parameters, patients' outcome, and selected proteins (CK5/6, CK14, CK8/18, CK19, EpCAM, Ki-67, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin). ALDH1 protein was detected in tumor and stromal cells in 16% and 67% of 348 primary PCa, respectively. Tumor cell ALDH1 expression was associated with advanced T stage (P = 0.009), higher Gleason score (P = 0.016), shorter time to biochemical recurrence (TBR P = 0.010) and CK14 expression (P = 0.023).

However, the expression and biological role of T-UCRs in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remain poorly understood. This study aimed to examine the expression and functional role of Uc.416 + A and analyze the association between Uc.416 + A and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in RCC.
METHODS: Expression of Uc.416 + A in 35 RCC tissues, corresponding normal kidney tissues and 13 types of normal tissue samples was determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We performed a cell growth and migration assay in RCC cell line 786-O transfected with negative control and siRNA for Uc.416 + A. We evaluated the relation between Uc.416 + A and miR-153, which has a complimentary site of Uc.416 + A.
RESULTS: qRT-PCR analysis revealed that the expression of Uc.416 + A was higher in RCC tissues than that in corresponding normal kidney tissues. Inhibition of Uc.416 + A reduced cell growth and cell migration activity. There was an inverse correlation between Uc.416 + A and miR-153. Western blot analysis showed Uc.416 + A modulated E-cadherin, vimentin and snail. The expression of Uc.416 + A was positively associated with the expression of SNAI1, VIM and inversely associated with the expression of CDH1.
CONCLUSIONS: The expression of Uc.416 + A was upregulated in RCC and especially in RCC tissues with sarcomatoid change. Uc.416 + A promoted epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition through miR-153.

30285803,Foxf2 plays a dual role during transforming growth factor beta-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition by promoting apoptosis yet enabling cell junction dissolution and migration.,"BACKGROUND: The most life-threatening step during malignant tumor progression is reached when cancer cells leave the primary tumor mass and seed metastasis in distant organs. To infiltrate the surrounding tissue and disseminate throughout the body, single motile tumor cells leave the tumor mass by breaking down cell-cell contacts in a process called epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). An EMT is a complex molecular and cellular program enabling epithelial cells to abandon their differentiated phenotype, including cell-cell adhesion and cell polarity, and to acquire mesenchymal features and invasive properties.
METHODS: We employed gene expression profiling and functional experiments to study transcriptional control of transforming growth factor (TGF)β-induced EMT in normal murine mammary gland epithelial (NMuMG) cells.
RESULTS: We identified that expression of the transcription factor forkhead box protein F2 (Foxf2) is upregulated during the EMT process. Although it is not required to gain mesenchymal markers, Foxf2 is essential for the disruption of cell junctions and the downregulation of epithelial markers in NMuMG cells treated with TGFβ. Foxf2 is critical for the downregulation of E-cadherin by promoting the expression of the transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin, Zeb1 and Zeb2, while repressing expression of the epithelial maintenance factor Id2 and miRNA 200 family members. Moreover, Foxf2 is required for TGFβ-mediated apoptosis during EMT by the transcriptional activation of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein Noxa and by the negative regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated survival signaling through direct repression of its ligands betacellulin and amphiregulin. The dual function of Foxf2 during EMT is underscored by the finding that high Foxf2 expression correlates with good prognosis in patients with early noninvasive stages of breast cancer, but with poor prognosis in advanced breast cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data identify the transcription factor Foxf2 as one of the important regulators of EMT, displaying a dual function in promoting tumor cell apoptosis as well as tumor cell migration.",Breast Cancer Res.,2018,"['Meyer-Schaller N', 'Heck C', 'Tiede S', 'Yilmaz M', 'Christofori G']",

However, the overall biological functions and their mechanism of H19 in glioma are not fully understood.
METHODS: Firstly, we analyzed H19 alterations in different grades of glioma tissues through an analysis of 5 sequencing datasets and qRT-PCR was performed to confirm the results. Next, we evaluated the effect of H19 on glioma cells migration, invasion and EMT process. Luciferase assays and RIP assays were employed to figure out the correlation of H19 and SOX4.
RESULTS: H19 was overexpressed in glioma tissues. Down-regulation of H19 led to the inhibition of migration, invasion and EMT process with a reduction in N-cadherin and Vimentin. H19 and SOX4 are both direct target of miR-130a-3p. H19 could compete with SOX4 via sponging miR-130a-3p.

METHODS: Totally 214 pairs of CRA and adjacent normal tissues were collected, and 5 human CRA cell lines (i.e. HCT116, HT-29, RKO SW280 and Lovo) were purchased. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was adopted to quantify the H19 and miR-194-5p expressions in cells and tissues. The expressions of FoxM1, E-cadherin, vimentin, N-cadherin were determined using western blot. On the side, si-H19, si-NC, miR-194-5p mimic, miR-194-5p inhibitor and negative control (NC) were transfected into CRA cell lines. Meanwhile, the invasive, migratory and proliferative conditions of the cells were assessed through transwell, wound healing and colony-forming experiments, with final verification of the relationship between H19 and miR-194-5p employing dual-luciferase reporter gene assay.
RESULTS: Highly-expressed H19, lowly-expressed miR-194-5p, low-grade differentiation and lymph node metastasis appeared as the independent predictors of unfavorable prognosis in CRA patients' (all P< 0.05). It indicated that FoxM1 expression displayed positive correlations with H19 expression, yet negative associations with miR-194-5p expression within CRA tissues (P< 0.05). In addition, transfection of H19-siRNA and miR-145-5p mimic triggered a conspicuous increase in E-cadherin expression, as well as an evidently down-regulation in vimentin and N-cadherin expressions within HT29 and RKO cells (P< 0.05). On the other hand, the invasive and migratory capacities of CRA cells were significantly hindered (P< 0.05). Moreover, the luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed that H19 modified miR-194-5p expression through directly targeting at it (P< 0.05). Ultimately, FoxM1 could reverse the role of miR-194-5p in inhibiting invasion, migration and EMT of CRA cells (P< 0.05).

METHODS: The number of M2 macrophages in 78 GBC and 16 normal gallbladder tissue samples was assessed by immunohistochemistry. The THP-1 monocyte cell line was differentiated into M2 macrophages and co-cultured with GBC-derived cell lines. The effect of M2 macrophages on promoting GBC cell migration and invasion was analyzed using migration, invasion and scratch wound healing assays. Western blotting and real-time PCR were used to assess the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and the activation status of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in GBC cells co-cultured with THP-1-derived macrophages.
RESULTS: The average number of M2 macrophages was found to be significantly higher in GBC tissues than in normal gallbladder tissues. We also found that GBC patients with higher M2 macrophage counts exhibited poorer overall survival rates. Co-culture with M2 macrophages significantly promoted the migration, invasion and EMT of GBC cells. Moreover, we found that CCL18 secreted from M2 macrophages had the same effect on GBC cells as M2 macrophages. Blocking the function of CCL18 with a neutralizing antibody reversed this effect. Finally, we found that M2 macrophages could activate PI3K/Akt signaling in GBC cells, thereby leading to migration, invasion and EMT of these cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings contribute to our understanding of the role of chronic inflammation in GBC development and progression, and may offer potential therapeutic targets for GBC.",Cell Oncol (Dordr),2019,"['Zhou Z', 'Peng Y', 'Wu X', 'Meng S', 'Yu W', 'Zhao J', 'Zhang H', 'Wang J', 'Li W']",

As a member of miRNAs family, miR-374b-5p has been reported to be a tumor suppressive gene in human cancers. In this study, the lower expression of miR-374b-5p was identified in OC tissues and cell liens using quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). Forkhead box protein P1 (FOXP1) can act as an oncogene in human cancers. Mechanism experiments revealed that FOXP1 is a target of miR-374b-5p. Functionally, miR-374b-5p suppressed cell proliferation, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in ovarian cancer. Moreover, the sensitivity of OC cells to cisplatin was markedly enhanced by miR-374b-5p. However, FOXP1 reversed However, FOXP1 reversed miR-374b-5p-mediated biological functions. Previous reports demonstrated the inhibitory effect of FOXP1 on transcription FOXP1. Thus, we further examined the effect of FOXP1 on the transcription activity of miR-374b-5p in OC cells. The results showed that FOXP1 decreased miR-374b-5p expression by inhibiting the transcription activity of miR-374b-5p. Rescue assays revealed the regulatory effect of miR-374b-5p-FOXP1 feedback loop on ovarian cancer progression.

30273566,Salinomycin suppresses cancer cell stemness and attenuates TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition of renal cell carcinoma cells.,"Metastatic Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains a difficult oncologic challenge. Salinomycin is a monocarboxylic polyether antibiotic, which has been proved to possess anti-tumor activities in multiple types of cancer cells. However, its effects on RCC cells remains unclear. In our study, salinomycin could inhibit the proliferation and viability of RCC cell lines 786-O and ACHN. The TUNEL assay revealed that treatment with salinomycin induced DNA breaking in RCC cells. Consistently, Western blotting showed up-regulation of pro-apoptotic biomarkers (cleaved caspase3/9 and cleaved PARP1) and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic biomarker (survivin) in RCC cells after salinomycin treatment, suggesting that salinomycin could induce RCC cell apoptosis. salinomycin treatment also suppressed the sphere formation ability of RCC cells and decreased the expressions of CD105, ALDH1 and CD44, biomarkers for reflecting the stemness of RCC cells. salinomycin treatment effectively down-regulated SMO and Gli1, two key proteins in Hedghog signaling pathway, in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, salinomycin could suppress the invasion and migration of RCC cells in the presence of TGF-β1, as observed in wound-healing and Transwell assays. salinomycin treatment attenuated TGF-β1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as evidenced by its ability to increase E-cadherin expression and decrease N-cadherin, Snail and MMP-2 expressions in RCC cells. Finally, salinomycin inhibited the tumorigenecity of RCC cells in vivo. Our study provides the evidence that salinomycin possess multiple anti-tumor activities against RCC, as it, in particular, suppressed the cancer stem cell properties and attenuated TGF-β-induced EMT. Therefore, it may serve as a potentially therapeutic candidate for metastatic RCC and improve the prognosis of RCC patients.",Chem. Biol.

30272371,Overexpression of Gremlin 1 by sonic hedgehog signaling promotes pancreatic cancer progression.,"Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling is an important promotor of desmoplasia, a critical feature in pancreatic cancer stromal reactions involving the activation of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). Gremlin 1 is widely overexpressed in cancer-associated stromal cells, including activated PSCs. In embryonic development, SHH is a potent regulator of Gremlin 1 through an interaction network. This subtle mechanism in the cancer microenvironment remains to be fully elucidated. The present study investigated the association between Gremlin 1 and SHH, and the effect of Gremlin 1 in pancreatic cancer. The expression of Gremlin 1 in different specimens was measured using immunohistochemistry. The correlations among clinicopathological features and levels of Gremlin 1 were evaluated. Primary human PSCs and pancreatic cancer cell lines were exposed to SHH, cyclopamine, GLI family zinc finger-1 (Gli-1) small interfering RNA (siRNA), and Gremlin 1 siRNA to examine their associations and effects using an MTT assay, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, western blot analysis, and migration or invasion assays. The results revealed the overexpression of Gremlin 1 in pancreatic cancer tissues, mainly in the stroma. The levels of Gremlin 1 were significantly correlated with survival rate and pT status. In addition, following activation of the PSCs, the expression levels of Gremlin 1 increased substantially. SHH acts as a potent promoter of the expression of Gremlin 1, and cyclopamine and Gli-1 siRNA modulated this effect. In a screen of pancreatic cancer cell lines, AsPC-1 and BxPC-3 cells expressed high levels of Gremlin 1, but only AsPC-1 cells exhibited a high expression level of SHH. The results of the indirect co-culture experiment suggested that paracrine SHH from the AsPC-1 cells induced the expression of Gremlin 1 in the PSCs. Furthermore, Gremlin 1 siRNA negatively regulated the proliferation and migration of PSCs, and the proliferation, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of AsPC-1 and BxPC-3 cells. Based on the data from the present study, it was concluded that an abnormal expression level of Gremlin 1 in pancreatic cancer was induced by SHH signaling, and that the overexpression of Gremlin 1 enabled pancreatic cancer progression.",Int.

In the present study, the association between breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein/breast cancer type 2 susceptibility protein‑containing complex subunit 3 (BRCC3) and cervical cancer was investigated. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were performed to determine BRCC3 mRNA and protein expression levels in cervical cancer tissues and cells, in addition to the expression levels of proteins associated with the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in HeLa and SiHa cells. Cell Counting Kit‑8, Transwell and wound healing assays were performed to determine the cell viability, invasion and migration abilities of cervical cancer cells, respectively. The results of the present study revealed that BRCC3 expression was significantly increased in cervical cancer tissues, which was also revealed to be associated with the clinical stages and pathological grades of cervical cancer exhibited by patients, in addition to the survival time. Furthermore, BRCC3 expression levels were enhanced in HeLa, SiHa and C‑33A cervical cancer cells. BRCC3 interference in HeLa and SiHa cells was revealed to suppress cell viability, invasion and migration abilities via upregulation of E‑cadherin expression levels and downregulation of Vimentin, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)‑2, MMP‑9, snail family transcriptional repressor (Snai)1 and Snai2 expression levels. In conclusion, the expression levels of BRCC3 were revealed to be increased in cervical cancer tissues, which were positively associated with clinical features of cervical cancer. Furthermore, BRCC3 interference inhibited the cell viability, invasion and migration abilities of HeLa and SiHa cells via regulation of EMT progression and expression levels of Snai family members. In addition, the results of the present study suggested that BRCC3 represents an oncogene associated with cervical cancer, and may also represent a novel therapeutic biomarker for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of patients with cervical cancer.",Mol Med Rep,2018,"['Zhang F', 'Zhou Q']",
30272353,"Downregulation of RNF138 inhibits cellular proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT in glioma cells via suppression of the Erk signaling pathway.","Glioma is the most common adult malignant primary brain tumor; however, the effect of chemotherapy is often limited by drug‑resistance and poor prognosis is common. Ring finger protein 138 (RNF138) belongs to the E3 ligase family, and has significantly higher expression level in glioma tissue than in noncancerous brain tissues. Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) has a critical role in cancer invasion and metastasis, ultimately leading to increased cell motility and resistance to genotoxic agents. Extracellular‑signal regulated kinase (Erk) pathways promote the growth of glioma cells and enhance tumor invasion, with a role in the progression of EMT. However, the association between RNF138 and human glioma progression remains poorly understood. Relatively little is known about the association between RNF138, Erk, and EMT in glioma progression. In the current study, experiments were performed to explore the potential roles and mechanisms of RNF138 in glioblastoma in vitro and in vivo. Glioma cell line proliferation, migration and invasion were inhibited by knockdown of RNF138 in vitro. By lowering the RNF138 expression, cleaved caspase3 and E‑cadherin were upregulated, while phospho‑Erk1/2, vimentin, MMP2, HIF‑1α and VEGF were downregulated in U87 and U251 cells in vitro. In vivo findings revealed that the growth of U87 cell‑transplanted tumors in nude mice was inhibited in tumors with RNF138 knockdown. These findings suggested that downregulation of RNF138 inhibited glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and reversed EMT, potentially via Erk signaling pathway. Therefore, RNF138 may be a potential therapeutic target against glioma.",Oncol. Rep.,2018,"['Wu H', 'Li X', 'Feng M', 'Yao L', 'Deng Z', 'Zao G', 'Zhou Y', 'Chen S', 'Du Z']",

However, its expression and function in human gastric cancer (GC) are still largely unknown. In this study, we confirmed for the first time that TRIM14 mRNA and protein were upregulated in GC tissues and cell lines as determined by qRT‑PCR and western blot analysis. Clinical data disclosed that high TRIM14 expression was significantly associated with aggressive prognostic features, including advanced TNM stage and lymph node metastasis. In regards to 5‑year survival, TRIM14 served as a potential prognostic marker for GC. Notably, TRIM14 promoted migration, invasion as measured by Transwell and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as determined by western blot analysis and immunofluorescence (IF) in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, TRIM14 induced protein kinase B (AKT) pathway activation, and inhibition of AKT reversed the TRIM14‑induced promotive effects on cell migration, invasion and EMT progression. Furthermore, we demonstrated that TRIM14 expression was regulated by miR‑195‑5p. miR‑195‑5p exerted an inhibitory role in GC migration and invasion. Finally, we confirmed that alteration of TRIM14 expression abolished the effects of miR‑195‑5p on GC cells. Conclusively, our results demonstrated that TRIM14 functions as an oncogene in regulating EMT and metastasis of GC via activating AKT signaling, which was regulated by miR‑195‑5p, supporting its potential utility as a therapeutic target for GC.",Oncol.

30272331,Characterisation of mesenchymal colon tumour-derived cells in tumourspheres as a model for colorectal cancer progression.,"Cellular plasticity, the ability of cells to switch from an epitheial phenotype to a mesenchymal one and vice versa, plays a crucial role in tumour progression and metastases development. In 20-25% of patients with colon cancer and in 18% of patients with rectal cancer, metastases are present at the time of the first diagnosis. They are the first cause of colorectal cancer (CRC)-related mortality, defining stage IV CRC, which is characterized by a relatively short overall survival. We previously isolated two primary colon adenocarcinoma cell cultures that had undergone epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), one with a high microsatellite instability phenotype (T88) and one with a chromosomal instability phenotype (T93). The aim of this study was to establish a model with which to study EMT, stemness features and cell plasticity in cancer progression and to examine the effects of incubation with lithium chloride (LiCl), a specific glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK-3β) inhibitor, on these cellular processes. Indeed, GSK3β is an important regulator of cell survival, which promotes tumourigenesis in colon cells by facilitating the crosstalk between colorectal cancer pathways. Thus, we further characterized our system of adherent primary mesenchymal colon cancer cells and their paired tumourspheres by examining the expression and localisation of a panel of markers, including E- and N‑cadherin, CD133, CD44v6, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) and leucine-rich repeat‑containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (LGR5). We also characterised the molecular features of these tumourspheres and examined their response to LiCl. Furthermore, we explored the effects of LiCl on cell motility and plasticity. We demonstrated that LiCl reduced cell migration, stemness features and cell plasticity. We also observed the atypical nuclear localisation of membrane proteins, including N‑cadherin, CD133 and CD44v6 in mesenchymal tumour cells. Of note, CD133 and CD44v6 appeared to localise at the plasma membrane in cells with a more epithelial phenotype, suggesting that the cytoplasmic/nuclear localisation of these proteins could favour and characterize cell plasticity in colorectal cancer progression.",Int.

TGF‑β1 signaling promotes cell metastasis by inducing epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT), however, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Our previous study demonstrated the anti‑metastatic effects of silibinin, a natural flavonoid derived from milk thistle, against TCC. The present study investigated the effects of silibinin on TGF‑β1‑induced EMT in TCC, focusing on the role of prostaglandin‑endoperoxide synthase 2 (COX‑2). Cell migration was determined by a wound healing assay and Transwell migration assay, and cell invasion was investigated using a Transwell invasion assay. Cell morphology was observed using an inverted microscope. Cell viability was evaluated by an MTT and cell counting assays. EMT markers were detected by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Specific small interfering RNA was used to knockdown COX‑2 gene expression. TGF‑β1 promoted cell migration and invasion, induced EMT and upregulated the expression of COX‑2. COX‑2 knockdown attenuated TGF‑β1‑induced EMT, indicating that COX‑2 upregulation was essential for TGF‑β1‑induced EMT. Silibinin attenuated TGF‑β1‑induced migration and invasion by inhibiting EMT, and was associated with COX‑2 downregulation. TGF‑β1‑induced COX‑2 upregulation, which was inhibited by silibinin.

30272313,ROR1 is highly expressed in circulating tumor cells and promotes invasion of pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic cancer (PaC) is an aggressive malignancy, which is associated with high levels of metastasis. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs), which may be considered a functional biomarker and promising treatment strategy for metastasis, are associated with the prognosis and progression of various metastatic cancers, including PaC. Receptor tyrosine kinase‑like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) expression contributes to cell metastasis and poor clinical outcomes in malignant tumors. The present study aimed to explore the function of ROR1 in PaC CTCs. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were used to examine the expression of ROR1, E‑cadherin and N‑cadherin. Cell proliferative and invasive ability was assessed by MTT and Transwell assays, respectively. The results revealed that the mRNA and protein expression levels of ROR1 were augmented in PaC tissues. Furthermore, the mRNA expression levels of ROR1 were higher in CTCs compared with in peripheral blood cells, and ROR1 was more highly expressed in CTCs than in cells. Notably, CTCs exhibited a markedly greater proliferative and invasive capacity than PANC‑1 and SW‑1990 cells, whereas knockdown of endogenous ROR1 by small interfering RNA led to suppression of the invasion of CTCs. In addition, it was revealed that the mechanism underlying the effects of ROR1 on PaC CTC metastasis may involve the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition process.

30272295,Radioresistant breast cancer cells exhibit increased resistance to chemotherapy and enhanced invasive properties due to cancer stem cells.,"Previous studies suggest that cancer stem cells (CSCs) exist in solid tumors, and contribute to therapeutic resistance and disease recurrence. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate whether radioresistant (RT‑R) breast cancer cells derived from breast cancer cells increase the number of CSCs, and whether these CSCs are responsible to increased invasiveness and therapeutic resistance. MCF‑7, T47D and MDA‑MB‑231 cells were irradiated 25 times (2 Gy each; 50 Gy total) to generate radioresistant breast cancer cells (RT‑R‑MCF‑7, RT‑R‑T47D and RT‑R‑MDA‑MB‑231). RT‑R‑breast cancer cells demonstrated increased cell viability against irradiation and increased colony forming abilities compared with parental breast cancer cells. Particularly, RT‑R‑MDA‑MB‑231 cells derived from highly metastatic MDA‑MB‑231 cells exhibited most radioresistance and chemoresistance of the three cell lines. In addition, MDA‑MB‑231 cells exhibited the most increased protein levels of CSCs markers cluster of differentiation 44, Notch‑4, octamer‑binding transcription factor 3/4 and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1, compared with RT‑R‑MCF‑7 cells, suggesting highly metastatic breast cancer cells MDA‑MB‑231 produce more CSCs. RT‑R‑MDA‑MB‑231 cells increased intercellular adhesion molecule‑1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule‑1 levels, resulting in enhanced migration and adhesion to endothelial cells (ECs), and enhanced invasiveness through ECs by inducing matrix metalloproteinase‑9, Snail‑1 and β‑catenin, and by downregulating E‑cadherin compared with MDA‑MB‑231 cells. These results suggest that highly metastatic breast cancer cells may increase the number of CSCs following radiation therapy, and CSCs present in RT‑R‑MDA‑MB‑231 cells contribute to the enhanced invasiveness by increasing migration, adhesion to ECs and invasion through ECs by promoting epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) via the upregulation of adhesion molecules and EMT‑associated proteins.",Oncol.

In this study, we demonstrate that the overexpression of miR‑103 in HCC cells promotes epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT), and is associated with an enhanced metastasis and poor outcomes, as shown by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Mechanistically, using reporter luciferase assay we reveal that the serine/threonine‑protein kinase, large tumor suppressor kinase 2 (LATS2), a key component of the Hippo signaling pathway, is a direct target of miR‑103 in HCC cells. Transwell assay, MTT assay and western blot analysis were performed to reveal that LATS2 can counteract the functional effects of miR‑103 on HCC metastasis, growth and EMT. The analyses of clinical data indicated that a high expression of miR‑103 correlated with a high expression of vimentin, but with a low expression of LATS2 and E‑cadherin in HCC tissues. miR‑103 also reduced yes‑associated protein (YAP) phosphorylation. On the whole, the findings of this study suggest that miR‑103 promotes HCC metastasis and EMT by directly inhibiting LATS2.

30272273,"GLI3 knockdown decreases stemness, cell proliferation and invasion in oral squamous cell carcinoma.","Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is an extremely aggressive disease associated with a poor prognosis. Previous studies have established that cancer stem cells (CSCs) actively participate in OSCC development, progression and resistance to conventional treatments. Furthermore, CSCs frequently exhibit a deregulated expression of normal stem cell signalling pathways, thereby acquiring their distinctive abilities, of which self-renewal is an example. In this study, we examined the effects of GLI3 knockdown in OSCC, as well as the differentially expressed genes in CSC-like cells (CSCLCs) expressing high (CD44high) or low (CD44low) levels of CD44. The prognostic value of GLI3 in OSCC was also evaluated. The OSCC cell lines were sorted based on CD44 expression; gene expression was evaluated using a PCR array. Following this, we examined the effects of GLI3 knockdown on CD44 and ESA expression, colony and sphere formation capability, stem-related gene expression, proliferation and invasion. The overexpression of genes related to the Notch, transforming growth factor (TGF)β, FGF, Hedgehog, Wnt and pluripotency maintenance pathways was observed in the CD44high cells. GLI3 knockdown was associated with a significant decrease in different CSCLC fractions, spheres and colonies in addition to the downregulation of the CD44, Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4; also known as POU5F1) and BMI1 genes. This downregulation was accompanied by an increase in the expression of the Involucrin (IVL) and S100A9 genes. Cellular proliferation and invasion were inhibited following GLI3 knockdown. In OSCC samples, a high GLI3 expression was associated with tumour size but not with prognosis. On the whole, the findings of this study demonstrate for the first time, at least to the best of our knowledge, that GLI3 contributes to OSCC stemness and malignant behaviour.

However, the function of lncRNAs in PDAC is poorly known. In the present study, a microarray assay was used to screen for differently expressed lncRNAs in PDAC and it was identified that cancer upregulated drug resistance (CUDR) was upregulated in PDAC. CUDR increased PDAC cell proliferation, migration and invasion, inhibited apoptosis, and promoted drug resistance; it also regulated the PDAC cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The CUDR-induced PDAC malignant phenotypes is via the protein kinase B and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase signaling pathways.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed, by immunohistochemistry in 45 equine penile proliferative epithelial lesions, the expression of COX-2, E-cadherin, vimentin, 14-3-3σ, and PTEN using monoclonal antibodies. Tumors were histopathologically classified as well-differentiated or poorly differentiated using the IF grading scheme. Semiquantitative analysis was performed to determine down or up-regulation of the proteins and association with histopathological characteristics were statistically investigated using Mann-Whitney U test and/or Spearman's tests.
RESULTS: COX-2 was neo-expressed in 86.6% of the cases and expression progressively increased from ePP to ePSCC (P = 0.0003) and from well to poorly differentiated (P = 0.033). High COX-2 expression was associated with a high mitotic index (MI) (P = 0.026). In contrast to normal epidermis, ePSCC had very low E-cadherin expression in 64% of the cases (P = 0.0005). Vimentin was neo-expressed in 65% of poorly differentiated ePSCC at the IF indicating EMT. Cytoplasmic 14-3-3σ protein expression was reduced in 42% of the ePSCC and additionally, nuclear expression of 14-3-3σ in neoplastic keratinocytes and in the cytoplasm of stromal fibroblasts at the IF was features only found in ePSCC. PTEN protein showed a tendency to be decreased or lost in ePSCC.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence of molecular abnormalities in ePSCC similar to those reported for human PSCC. The occurrence of EMT at the IF is a common event in ePSCC.

30268789,Acidic Bile Salts Induce Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition via VEGF Signaling in Non-Neoplastic Barrett's Cells.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Metaplastic glands buried under squamous epithelium are frequently detected in patients with Barrett esophagus (BE). This subsquamous intestinal metaplasia might be responsible for cancers that develop despite endoscopic surveillance and for metaplasia recurrences after endoscopic ablation. To determine whether reflux induces BE cells to undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that produces subsquamous intestinal metaplasia, we assessed EMT in BE cells exposed to acidic bile salts and in rat and human esophageal tissues.
METHODS: We compared markers of EMT and cell motility in trans-well and 3-dimensional organotypic culture systems among dysplastic BE epithelial cell lines, nondysplastic telomerase-immortalized BE cell lines (BAR-T), and BAR-T cells exposed acutely or for 20 weeks to acidic bile salts. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) A was inhibited with a neutralizing antibody or CRISPR-Cas9n and VEGF receptor 2 was inhibited with SU1498 or shRNA, and cells were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, or immunoblotting for markers of VEGF signaling and EMT; cell motility was assessed by trans-well assay. We used immunohistochemistry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction to assess EMT markers in the columnar-lined esophagus of rats with surgically induced reflux esophagitis and in esophagectomy specimens from patients with BE.
RESULTS: We detected features of EMT (decreased cadherin 1 [CDH1]; increased fibronectin 1, vimentin, and matrix metalloproteinase 2; and increased motility) in dysplastic BE epithelial cell lines and in BAR-T cells exposed for 20 weeks, but not in unexposed BAR-T cells. Acute acidic bile salt exposure induced expression of zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 and 2 (ZEB1/2) in BAR-T cells, which decreased their expression of CDH1 and increased motility; inhibitors of VEGF signaling blocked these effects. Columnar-lined esophagus of rats with reflux esophagitis had increased expression of ZEB1/2 and decreased expression of CDH1 compared with controls. Dysplastic BE tissues also had significantly increased levels of ZEB1 and significantly decreased levels of CDH1 compared with nondysplastic BE tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: In BE cell lines, acidic bile salts induce EMT by VEGF signaling, which increases expression of ZEB1/2, repressors of CDH1. These observations suggest that reflux induces EMT in metaplastic BE tissues, which promotes development of subsquamous intestinal metaplasia.",Gastroenterology,2019,"['Zhang Q', 'Agoston AT', 'Pham TH', 'Zhang W', 'Zhang X', 'Huo X', 'Peng S', 'Bajpai M', 'Das K', 'Odze RD', 'Spechler SJ', 'Souza RF']",

However, the roles and underlying mechanisms of ADAMTS9-AS2 in OC remain unclear. In the present study, we showed that ADAMTS9-AS2 expression was significantly decreased in OC tissues and cell lines. Low ADAMTS9-AS2 expression was correlated with advanced FIGO stage, lymph-node metastasis, and poor overall survival of OC patients. Function assays showed that ADAMTS9-AS2 reduced OC cells proliferation, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) processes in vitro and restrained tumor growth in vivo. The underlying mechanism studies indicated that ADAMTS9-AS2 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-182-5p to promote cell proliferation and invasion.

However, the role of TRIP13 in prostate cancer was still unclear. In our study, the correlation between TRIP13 expression and clinical parameters including prognosis was evaluated in 160 prostate cancer patients. Moreover, the MTT assay, cell migration and invasion assays were performed to assess the effect of TRIP13 on prostate cancer cell biological behaviour. In our results, the expression status of TRIP13 was observed to be elevated in prostate cancer tissue samples through analyzing microarray (GSE55945). Furthermore, mRNA and protein TRIP13 expression were confirmed to be overexpressed in prostate cancer tissue samples and cell lines. High-expression of TRIP13 was correlated with present lymph node involvement, distant metastasis, high Gleason score, levels of serum PSA and poor prognosis in prostate cancer patients. The gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies suggested that TRIP13 functioned as oncogene to regulate prostate cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion through controlling YWHAZ and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated genes. In conclusion, TRIP13 is correlated with clinical progression and poor prognosis, and serves as oncogene in prostate cancer.",Int. J. Biol.

30267476,GNA13 promotes tumor growth and angiogenesis by upregulating CXC chemokines via the NF-κB signaling pathway in colorectal cancer cells.,"GNA13 has been found overexpressed in various types of cancer, which is related to tumor metastasis and progression. However, the biological functions of GNA13 in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the role of GNA13 in CRC and investigate the mechanism of how GNA13 promotes tumor growth. Interestingly, our findings showed that GNA13 is commonly upregulated in CRC, where these events are associated with a worse histologic grade and poor survival. Increased expression levels of GNA13 promoted cell growth, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, whereas GNA13 silencing abrogated these malignant phenotypes. In addition, overexpressing GNA13 in cancer cells increased the levels of the chemokines CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL4, which contributed to CRC proliferation and colony formation. Moreover, our mechanistic investigations suggest that the NF-κB/p65 signaling pathway was activated by the increase in GNA13 levels. Inhibiting the NF-κB/p65 pathway with an inhibitor decreased GNA13-induced migration, invasion and CXCL chemokine level increases, indicating the critical role of NF-κB/p65 signaling in mediating the effects of GNA13 in CRC. Together, these results demonstrate a key role of GNA13 overexpression in CRC that contributes to malignant behavior in cancer cells, at least in part through stimulating angiogenesis and increasing the levels of the NF-κB-dependent chemokines CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL4.",Cancer Med,2018,"['Zhang Z', 'Tan X', 'Luo J', 'Cui B', 'Lei S', 'Si Z', 'Shen L', 'Yao H']",

However, the mechanisms by which dictamnine inhibits tumor growth are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of dictamnine as a treatment for cancer and to identify the underlying mechanisms of its anticancer activity. Here, dictamnine showed the potent inhibitory activity against HIF-1α and Slug activation induced by hypoxia in various human cancer cell lines. This compound markedly decreased the hypoxia-induced accumulation of HIF-1α and Slug protein in a dose-dependent manner. Further analysis revealed that dictamnine inhibited HIF-1α protein synthesis, without affecting its degradation. Our results demonstrated that dictamnine reduced HIF-1α protein synthesis by downregulating the mTOR/p70S6K/eIF4E and MAPK pathways, and reduced the expression of Slug by inhibiting the GSK-3β/Slug signaling pathway. Moreover, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was inhibited in dictamnine-treated tumors by downregulation of HIF-1α and Slug, as reflected by the upregulation of E-cadherin and Occludin, and the downregulation of N-cadherin and Vimentin. Phenomenological experiments showed that dictamnine reduced migration and invasion, inhibited HCT116 cell proliferation and promoted HCT116 cell apoptosis by downregulating HIF-1α and Slug. In vivo studies further confirmed that dictamnine treatment caused significant inhibition of tumor growth in a xenograft tumor model. These findings suggest that dictamnine is a potent cancer inhibitor, providing a rationale for anticancer pathway-targeted therapy.",Chem. Biol.

Western blot and real-time PCR were used to detect UNR expression level in glioma cell lines and tissues. Next, UNR siRNAs were transfected in glioma cells, and MTS assay and scratch wound-healing assay were used to detect changes in cell proliferation and migration. Then, the candidate UNR target mRNAs were identified by analyzing the sequencing data of UNR iCLIP-seq, RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling databases of human melanoma. RNA immunoprecipitation and biotin pull-down assays were used to identify the UNR target mRNAs in glioma cells. Finally, western blot was used to detect the effect of UNR knockdown on ribosomal protein L9 (RPL9) and RPL9 protein expression level in glioma cell lines. RPL9 siRNA was transfected in A172 and T98G and the expression of vimentin in the cells was detected with western blot.Results Bioinformatics analysis showed that UNR mRNA expression level was significantly higher in high-grade glioma [Grade 2 (n=126), Grade 3 (n=51), Grade 4 (n=128), P<0.001]. UNR high expression levels were associated with poor prognosis (P=0.0177). UNR had high expression level in glioma cell lines and patient samples compared with normal cell lines and normal brain samples (P<0.01). Knockdown of UNR inhibited glioma cells migration (P<0.05), but did not inhibit glioma cells growth in three glioma cell lines. UNR binded the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of PTEN and RPL9 mRNAs. RPL9 protein was significantly highly expressed in most glioma cell lines (n=9) and knockdown of UNR resulted in a downregulation of RPL9 protein expression. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related marker─vimentin was positively regulated by RPL9.Conclusions UNR could bind to the 3'UTR of PTEN and RPL9 in glioma cell lines, therefore promoting glioma cell migration and regulating the expression of RPL9.

30265376,"Somatic aberrations of BRCA1 gene are associated with ALDH1, EGFR, and tumor progression in prostate cancer.","BRCA1 is a pivotal tumor suppressor. Its dysfunction is known to play a role in different tumors. Among others, BRCA1 germline mutations account for higher risk and more aggressive course of prostate cancer (PCa). In addition, somatic BRCA1 gene loss was demonstrated to be a signature of PCa dissemination to lymph nodes and peripheral blood, and indicate worse clinical outcome. In order to substantiate the data for BRCA1 gene loss in PCa and reveal its phenotypical background, BRCA1 gene status was assessed in a large cohort of PCa patients and compared to different molecular factors. BRCA1 gene dosage was assessed in 2398 tumor samples from 1,199 PCa patients using fluorescent in situ hybridization. It was compared to clinico-pathological parameters, patients' outcome as well as selected proteins (Ki-67, apoptosis marker, cytokeratins, vimentin, E- and N-cadherin, ALDH1 and EGFR) examined immunohistochemically. BRCA1 losses were found in 10%, whereas gains appeared in 7% of 603 informative PCa patients. BRCA1 losses correlated to higher T stage (p = 0.027), Gleason score (p = 0.039), shorter time to biochemical recurrence in patients with Gleason score > 7 independently of other factors (multivariate analysis, p = 0.005) as well as expression of proteins regulating stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, that is, ALDH1 (p = 0.021) and EGFR (p = 0.011), respectively. BRCA1 gains correlated to shorter time to metastasis (p = 0.012) and expression of ALDH1 (p = 0.014). These results support the assumption that BRCA1 gene losses contribute to a progressive and stem cell-like phenotype of PCa.

30264477,The anti-metastatic effect of ginsenoside Rb2 in colorectal cancer in an EGFR/SOX2-dependent manner.,"Ginsenoside Rb2, a saponin from Panax ginseng, has been shown to have many functions. However, the effect of ginsenoside Rb2 on the metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unknown. CRC cell lines HT29 and SW620 were used to determine the effects of ginsenoside Rb2 on the colony-forming, migration, invasion, and wound-healing abilities of CRC cells in vitro. Further, ginsenoside Rb2 was given intraperitoneally at 5 mg/kg of mouse body weight to check its effect on the metastasis of CRC cells in vivo. Ginsenoside Rb2 decreased colony-forming ability, migration, invasion, and wound healing of CRC cells in vitro, although it did not affect cell proliferation. As a possible mechanism, we found that ginsenoside Rb2 down-regulated the expression of stemness and Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes via the EGFR/SOX2 signaling axis; these were partially rescued by either exogenous EGF treatment or ectopic expression of SOX2. More importantly, ginsenoside Rb2 significantly reduced the number of metastatic nodules in the livers, lungs, and kidneys in a mouse model of metastasis. These results suggest that ginsenoside Rb2 could be used to treat the metastasis of CRC therapeutically or as a supplement.",Cancer Med,2018,"['Phi LTH', 'Wijaya YT', 'Sari IN', 'Yang YG', 'Lee YK', 'Kwon HY']",

30262435,Neuroendocrine differentiation contributes to radioresistance development and metastatic potential increase in non-small cell lung cancer.,"Radiation treatment induces neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) A549 and H157 cells, so higher NE-like features in radioresistant A549 (A549R26-1) and H157 (H157R24-1) cells are observed than in parental cells. We detected higher NED marker expressions in A549R26-1 cell-derived tumors than in A549 cell-derived tumors. In mechanism studies, we found that NED induction in A549R26-1 and H157R24-1 cells was accompanied by increased intracellular cAMP and IL-6 levels. Treatment of radioresistant lung cancer cells with the inhibitor (SQ22536) of adenylate cyclase (AC) which is the enzyme responsible for the cAMP production, or the neutralizing antibody (Ab) of IL-6, resulted in decreased NE-like features in radioresistant lung cancer cells. In addition, we found MEK/Erk is the signaling pathway that triggers the cAMP- and IL-6-mediated NED induction in radioresistant lung cancer cells. Also, we found that MEK/Erk signaling pathway inhibition decreased NED in radioresistant cells. Radioresistant lung cancer cells exhibiting high NE-like features also showed higher radioresistance and higher metastatic potential than parental cells. When we inhibited cAMP-, or IL-6-mediated pathways, or the downstream MEK/Erk signaling pathway, radiosensitivity of radioresistant lung cancer cells was significantly increased and their metastatic potential was significantly reduced. In in vivo mouse studies, reducing NED by treating mice with the MEK/Erk inhibitor increased radiosensitivity. Immunohistochemical staining of tumor tissues lowered expressions of the NED/epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)/metastatic markers when mice were treated with the MEK/Erk inhibitor.",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Res,2018,"['Zhu R', 'Yang X', 'Xue X', 'Shen M', 'Chen F', 'Chen X', 'Tsai Y', 'Keng PC', 'Chen Y', 'Lee SO', 'Chen Y']",
30261040,EpCAM ectodomain EpEX is a ligand of EGFR that counteracts EGF-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition through modulation of phospho-ERK1/2 in head and neck cancers.,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are characterized by outstanding molecular heterogeneity that results in severe therapy resistance and poor clinical outcome. Inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was recently revealed as a major parameter of poor clinical outcome. Here, we addressed the expression and function of the therapeutic target epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and of the major determinant of epithelial differentiation epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) in clinical samples and in vitro models of HNSCCs. We describe improved survival of EGFRlow/EpCAMhigh HNSCC patients (n = 180) and provide a molecular basis for the observed disparities in clinical outcome. EGF/EGFR have concentration-dependent dual capacities as inducers of proliferation and EMT through differential activation of the central molecular switch phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (pERK1/2) and EMT transcription factors (EMT-TFs) Snail, zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (Zeb1), and Slug. Furthermore, soluble ectodomain of EpCAM (EpEX) was identified as a ligand of EGFR that activates pERK1/2 and phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) and induces EGFR-dependent proliferation but represses EGF-mediated EMT, Snail, Zeb1, and Slug activation and cell migration. EMT repression by EpEX is realized through competitive modulation of pERK1/2 activation strength and inhibition of EMT-TFs, which is reflected in levels of pERK1/2 and its target Slug in clinical samples. Accordingly, high expression of pERK1/2 and/or Slug predicted poor outcome of HNSCCs. Hence, EpEX is a ligand of EGFR that induces proliferation but counteracts EMT mediated by the EGF/EGFR/pERK1/2 axis. Therefore, the emerging EGFR/EpCAM molecular cross talk represents a promising target to improve patient-tailored adjuvant treatment of HNSCCs.",PLoS Biol.,2018,"['Pan M', 'Schinke H', 'Luxenburger E', 'Kranz G', 'Shakhtour J', 'Libl D', 'Huang Y', 'Gaber A', 'Pavšič M', 'Lenarčič B', 'Kitz J', 'Jakob M', 'Schwenk-Zieger S', 'Canis M', 'Hess J', 'Unger K', 'Baumeister P', 'Gires O']",

Here, we showed that in ovarian cancer CXCL12 induced EMT phenotypes including the spindle-like cell morphology, podia and stress fiber formation, a decrease in E-cadherin expression, and increases in mesenchymal N-cadherin and vimentin expressions. These effects of CXCL12 could be antagonized by the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100, but not by the anti-CXCR7 antibody. The expressions of the EMT markers were significantly down-regulated by the CXCR4 siRNA, and up-regulated by the pcDNA3.1/CXCR4 plasmid, whereas not affected by the CXCR7 siRNA. Furthermore, intraperitoneal administration of AMD3100 inhibited tumor dissemination and growth in the nude mice inoculated with ovarian IGROV-1 cells with a concomitant reduction in EMT marker expressions. Collectively, these data suggest that CXCR4, rather than CXCR7, plays a key role in CXCL12-activated EMT phenotypes, and targeting the CXCL12-CXCR4 chemokine axis represents a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent ovarian cancer progression.",Mol.

Here, we show that Ahnak induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in response to TGFβ. EMT phenotypes, including altered in cell morphology, and expression patterns of various EMT marker genes were detected in HaCaT keratinocytes transfected with Ahnak-specific siRNA. Knockdown of Ahnak expression in HaCaT keratinocytes resulted in attenuated cell migration and invasion. We found that Ahnak activates TGFβ signaling via Smad3 phosphorylation, leading to enhanced Smad3 transcriptional activity. To validate function of Ahnak in EMT of B16F10 cells having high metastatic and tumorigenic properties, we established B16F10 cells with stable knockdown of Ahnak. N-cadherin expression and Smad3 phosphorylation were significantly decreased in B16F10-shAhnak cells, compared to B16F10-shControl cells after treatment of TGFβ. Moreover, TGFβ failed to induce cell migration and cell invasion in B16F10-shAhnak cells. To determine whether Ahnak regulates the metastatic activity of B16F10 cells, we established a lung metastasis model in C57BL/6 mice via tail vein injection of B16F10-shAhnak cells. Lung metastasis was significantly suppressed in mice injected with B16F10-shAhnak cells, compared to those injected with B16F10-shControl cells.

30257387,"Oviductus ranae protein hydrolysate (ORPH) inhibits the growth, metastasis and glycolysis of HCC by targeting miR-491-5p/PKM2 axis.","BACKGROUND: Oviductus Ranae (OR) is a valuable Chinese crude drug and has been reported to have a range of biological activities. Protein hydrolysate extracted from OR (ORPH) was previously found to have immune regulatory effect and anti-glioma activity. This study was aimed to investigate the effects of ORPH on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression.
METHODS: MTT, BrdU, colony formation and transwell assays were used to determine proliferation and mobility of HCC cells in vitro. Glucose consumption and lactate production assays were carried out to measure the glycolysis of HCC cells. The subcutaneous tumor model and lung metastasis model in nude mice were established to detect tumor growth and metastasis of HCC in vivo. The direct binding of miR-491-5p to 3'UTR of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay.
RESULTS: In vitro experiments showed that ORPH significantly inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and glycolysis of HCC cells. Moreover, ORPH treatment prominently suppressed HCC growth and metastasis in mice. We demonstrated that ORPH effectively decreased the expression of PKM2 in HCC cells. Forced expression of PKM2 abrogated the inhibitory effects of ORPH on HCC cells. Mechanically, ORPH reduced PKM2 expression in a post-transcriptional manner by up-regulating miR-491-5p. miR-491-5p exhibited a similar tumor suppressive effects with ORPH in HCC cells. Moreover, ORPH exerted its inhibitory effects on HCC cells through regulating miR-491-5p/PKM2 axis. Lastly, decreased miR-491-5p level and increased PKM2 expression were correlated with unfavorable clinical features and poor prognosis of HCC patients.
CONCLUSIONS: In all, this study reveals that ORPH inhibits the growth, metastasis and glycolysis of HCC cells by targeting miR-491-5p/PKM2 axis.

Targeting protein for Xenopus kinesin-like protein 2 (TPX2) has been shown to promote oncogenesis in the context of several cancers; however, its' role in cholangiocarcinoma has not been studied. We evaluated the role of TPX2 in cholangiocarcinoma.
METHODS: Expression levels of TPX2 in cholangiocarcinoma were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Potential correlations were assessed by Chi-squared test. Impact of TPX2 expression on cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, cell invasion and migration was investigated by CCK-8, flow cytometric analysis, and transwell assay, respectively. The expressions of cell-cycle, cell-apoptosis and EMT related target proteins were detected by immunoblotting.
RESULTS: TPX2 expression in cholangiocarcinoma tissues was significantly higher than that paracancerous tissue (44.3% vs. 5.7%; P<0.01). Overexpression of TPX2 showed a positive correlation with TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, and prognosis of patients.

METHODS: Human cervical cancer cell line Hela was classified into Control, NC siRNA, ZEB1-AS1 siRNA, SB203580 (p38MAPK pathway inhibitor) and ZEB1-AS1 siRNA + Anisomycin (p38MAPK pathway activator) groups. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed for ZEB1-AS1 expression, Western blotting to measure p38MAPK signaling pathway-/EMT-related proteins, and Wound-healing and Transwell assays to evaluate cell migration and invasion respectively.
RESULTS: ZEB1-AS1 was upregulated in cancer tissues and related to major clinicopathological features of cervical cancer. Besides, patients with lower-ZEB1-AS1-expression had a higher 5-year survival rate than those patients with higher-ZEB1-AS1-expression. High ZEB1-AS1 expression and advanced Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage were independent risk factors for patients' prognosis. Both ZEB1-AS1 siRNA and SB203580 effectively reduced p-p38 expression and the migration and invasion of Hela cells, with elevation of E-cadherin and reduction of Vimentin and N-cadherin. However, inhibitory effects of ZEB1-AS1 siRNA on EMT as well as cell migration and invasion of the Hela cell were reversed by Anisomycin.

A more in-depth understanding of signaling mechanism underlying CXCR4 is critical to develop effective therapies toward metastasis. Recently, the role of antimicrobial peptide LL-37 in contributing to the metastasis of breast cancer cells was observed. Clinical analysis of data herein demonstrated for the first time that overexpression of LL-37 and CXCR4 co-existed in human primary breast tumors with lymph node metastases. Further study disclosed that forced expression of CXCR4 led to the enhancement of pro-migratory signaling and migration rate induced by LL-37 in breast cancer cells. Moreover, LL-37 affected tumor microenvironment including induction of migration of mesenchymal stem cells and CXCR4-dependent capillary-like tubule formation. Functional analysis showed that LL-37 induced the internalization of CXCR4 through approaching Glu268, the residue of CXCR4, independent of the binding pocket (Asp171, Asp262, and Glu288) for CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100, signifying that LL-37 is a distinct agonist of CXCR4.

30251680,Role of p38γ MAPK in regulation of EMT and cancer stem cells.,"p38γ is a member of p38 MAPK family which contains four isoforms p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ. p38γ MAPK has unique function and is less investigated. Recent studies revealed that p38γ MAPK may be involved in tumorigenesis and cancer aggressiveness. However, the underlying cellular/molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process that epithelial cancer cells transform to facilitate the loss of epithelial features and gain of mesenchymal phenotype. EMT promotes cancer cell progression and metastasis, and is involved in the regulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs) which have self-renewal capacity and are resistant to chemotherapy and target therapy. We showed that p38γ MAPK significantly increased EMT in breast cancer cells; over-expression of p38γ MAPK enhanced EMT while its down-regulation inhibited EMT. Meanwhile, p38γ MAPK augmented CSC population while knock down of p38γ MAPK decreased CSC ratio in breast cancer cells. MicroRNA-200b (miR-200b) was down-stream of p38γ MAPK and inhibited by p38γ MAPK; miR-200b mimics blocked p38γ MAPK-induced EMT while miR-200b inhibitors promoted EMT. p38γ MAPK regulated miR-200b through inhibiting GATA3. p38γ MAPK induced GATA3 ubiquitination, leading to its proteasome-dependent degradation. Suz12, a Polycomb group protein, was down-stream of miR-200b and involved in miR-200b regulation of EMT.

In solid cancers, two isoforms SYK(L) and SYK(S) of SYK were recently identified due to its alternative mRNA splicing. However, the cellular activity and the biological significance of the long isoform of SYK, SYK(L), is still not well defined in human lung cancers. Here, we describe an interaction between SYK(L) and the ubiquitously expressed transcription regulator Yin Yang 1 (YY1) in the nucleus, which suppresses the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by inactivating SNAI2 (coding transcription factor SLUG) transcription. ChIP indicated that endogenous SYK(L) interacts directly with a YY1 binding cis-regulatory element in the SNAI2 promoter. Importantly, knockdown of YY1 activates SYK(L)-dependent EMT suppression in human lung cancer H1155 cells. We also found that the protein level of SYK(L) is markedly upregulated in various types of human lung cancers, and its nuclear localization is strongly correlated with clinical benefits of lung adenocarcinomas. Collectively, our data reveal a SYK(L)-dependent transcriptional regulation of EMT through SLUG as a potential biomarker for lung cancer aggressiveness.",FEBS J.,2018,"['Gao D', 'Wang L', 'Zhang H', 'Yan X', 'Yang J', 'Zhou R', 'Chang X', 'Sun Y', 'Tian S', 'Yao Z', 'Zhang K', 'Liu Z', 'Ma Z']",

An increasing number of studies demonstrated Enah overexpression is involved in human colorectal carcinomas, breast cancers and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the significance of Enah expression in gastric cancer (GC) is poorly elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that Enah is upregulated in GC and associated with AJCC stage, depth of invasion and poor overall survival (OS). Knockdown of Enah inhibited GC cell proliferation and metastasis and vice versa. Further experiments suggested that p-Erk1/2, p-AKT, p-p65, Vimentin and Fibronectin were downregulated and E-cadherin was upregulated after Enah silencing, implicating altered functions in GC proliferation and metastasis. Thus, our study suggests that Enah is a harmful factor for GC and a novel target for GC treatment.",Cell Death Dis,2018,"['Chen D', 'Xu L', 'Li X', 'Chu Y', 'Jiang M', 'Xu B', 'Zhao M', 'Wang W', 'Wang H', 'Kang H', 'Wang K', 'Wu K', 'Liang J', 'Ren G']",

METHODS: METTL3 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in 162 ovarian carcinoma patients. Stable cell lines with METTL3 gene overexpression or knockdown were established to investigate the function of METTL3 in ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: METTL3 was frequently upregulated in ovarian carcinoma and that a high level of METTL3 was significantly associated with tumor grade (P = 0.001), pT status (P = 0.002), pN/pM status (P < 0.001), FIGO stage (P < 0.001), and overall survival rate (P < 0.001). Stable overexpression of METTL3 in the OVCAR3 and COV504 cell lines significantly increased cellular proliferation, focus formation, motility, invasion, and tumor formation in nude mice. Silencing METTL3 expression in the SKOV3 and HO-8910 cell lines with short hairpin RNA effectively inhibited its oncogenic function. Further study found that METTL3 promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by upregulating the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that METTL3 plays very important oncogenic roles in ovarian carcinoma development and/or aggressiveness by stimulating AXL translation and EMT and that METTL3 may serve as a novel prognostic and/or therapeutic target of interest in ovarian cancer.",Gynecol.

However, the clinical significance and the biological role of PRR11 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the expression pattern, prognostic value and the biological role of PRR11 in HCC. PRR11 expression in 80 HCC surgical specimens was examined, and its clinical significance was analyzed. The role of PRR11 in cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion were also determined. The results showed that PRR11 mRNA was significantly up-regulated in 56.25% (45/80) HCC from that in matched adjacent non-tumor tissues. High PRR11 was correlated with tumor size (P = 0.01) and TNM stage (P = 0.006). Patients with higher PRR11 expression had poor overall survival time (P < 0.001). Furthermore, PRR11 silencing obviously inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, as well as cell migration and invasion of HCC cell lines in vitro. Mechanistically, knockdown of PRR11 significantly decreased the expression of β-catenin, cyclinD1, c-myc and N-cadherin in HCC cell lines. Additionally, the inhibitory effects of PRR11 silencing on cell migration was significantly enhanced by β-catenin inhibition. PRRl1 mRNA expression was found positively correlated with β-catenin (R = 0.5472, P ˂ 0.0001), c-myc (R = 0.5527, P ˂ 0.0001) and cyclinD1 (R = 0.3948, P = 0.0003) in HCC tissues.

30247804,Regulation of proliferation and invasion by the IGF signalling pathway in Epstein-Barr virus-positive gastric cancer.,"Several carcinomas including gastric cancer have been reported to contain Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. EBV-associated gastric cancer (EBVaGC) is classified as one of four molecular subtypes of gastric cancer by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) group with increased immune-related signatures. Identification of EBV-dependent pathways with significant biological roles is needed for EBVaGC. To compare the biological changes between AGS gastric epithelial cells and EBV-infected AGS (AGS-EBV) cells, proliferation assay, CCK-8 assay, invasion assay, cell cycle analysis, RT-PCR, Western blot and ELISA were performed. BI836845, a humanized insulin-like growth factor (IGF) ligand-neutralizing antibody, was used for IGF-related signalling pathway inhibition. AGS-EBV cells showed slower proliferating rate and higher sensitivity to BI836845 compared to AGS cells. Moreover, invasiveness of AGS-EBV was increased than that of AGS, and BI836845 treatment significantly decreased the invasiveness of AGS-EBV. Although no apoptosis was detected, entry into the S phase of the cell cycle was delayed in BI836845-treated AGS-EBV cells. In conclusion, AGS-EBV cells seem to modulate their proliferation and invasion through the IGF signalling pathway.

30247800,NEK4 kinase regulates EMT to promote lung cancer metastasis.,"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a dynamic transitional state from the epithelial to mesenchymal phenotypes. Numerous studies have suggested that EMT and its intermediate states play important roles in tumor invasion and metastasis. To identify novel regulatory molecules of EMT, we screened a siRNA library targeting human 720 kinases in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring E-cadherin promoter-luciferase reporter vectors. NIMA-related kinase-4 (NEK4) was identified and characterized as a positive regulator of EMT in the screening. Suppression of NEK4 resulted in the inhibition of cell migration and invasion, accompanying with an increased expression of cell adhesion-related proteins such as E-cadherin and ZO1. Furthermore, NEK4 knockdown caused the decreased expression of the transcriptional factor Zeb1 and Smads proteins, which are known to play key roles in EMT regulation. Consistently, overexpression of NEK4 resulted in the decreased expression of E-cadherin and increased expression of Smad3. Using a mouse model with tail vein injection of NEK4 knockdown stable cell line, we found a lower rate of tumor formation and metastasis of the NEK4-knockdown cells in vivo. Thus, this study demonstrates NEK4 as a novel kinase involved in regulation of EMT and suggests that NEK4 may be further explored as a potential therapeutic target for lung cancer metastasis.",J.

CRNDE and miR-217 are non-coding RNAs which play critical roles in cell growth, proliferation, migration. Mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) also participates in cancer cell process. Hence, this study aimed at investigating the effect of CRNDE on migration and invasion of HCC and figuring out the role of miR-217 and MAPK1 in this process. The overexpression of CRNDE was demonstrated by a microarray-based lncRNA profiling study. CRNDE expression in HCC was verified by qRT-PCR. MTT assay and BrdU staining were applied to detect cell proliferation level. Transwell assay was utilized to examine cell migration and invasiveness abilities. Wound healing assay was performed for further exploration of cell migration capacity. MiR-217 was predicted by bioinformatics. The dual luciferase reporter assay was performed to corroborate the targeting relationship between CRNDE, miR-217 and MAPK1. MAPK1, the downstream target of miR-217, was predicted using bioinformatics and was further confirmed by qRT-PCR and Western blot. The interaction between CRNDE, miR-217 and MAPK1 was studied by qRT-PCR, Western blot, MTT, BrdU, transwell assay and wound healing assay. CRNDE was up-regulated in HCC tissues and HCC cell lines. The high expression of CRNDE facilitated cell proliferation, migration and invasion, while the inhibited one affected on the contrary. MiR-217, negatively correlated with CRNDE expression, was the target of CRNDE and was more lowly expressed in HCC. With the high expression of miR-217, HCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion were suppressed. MAPK1, the possible target of miR-217, was negatively correlated with miR-217 but positively correlated with CRNDE and had the same effect in HCC formation process as CRNDE.

Therefore, this study explored the relationship between this protein and liver cancer and investigated its molecular mechanism of action.
Methods: The expression of XB130 between HCC tissues and adjacent nontumor tissues was compared by real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunochemistry, and Western blotting. XB130 silencing was performed using small hairpin RNA. The effect of silencing XB130 was examined using Cell Counting Kit-8, colony assay, wound healing assay, and cell cycle analysis.
Results: We found that XB130 was highly expressed in HCC tissues (cancer tissues vs. adjacent tissues: 0.23 ± 0.02 vs. 0.17 ± 0.02, P < 0.05) and liver cancer cell lines, particularly MHCC97H and HepG2 (MHCC97H and HepG2 vs. normal liver cell line LO-2: 2.35 ± 0.26 and 2.04 ± 0.04 vs. 1.00 ± 0.04, respectively, all P < 0.05). The Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, colony formation assay, and xenograft model in nude mice showed that silencing XB130 inhibited cell proliferative ability both in vivo and in vitro, with flow cytometry demonstrating that the cells were arrested in the G0/G1 phase in HepG2 (HepG2 XB130-silenced group [shA] vs. HepG2 scramble group [NA]: 74.32 ± 5.86% vs. 60.21 ± 3.07%, P < 0.05) and that the number of G2/M phase cells was decreased (HepG2 shA vs. HepG2 NA: 8.06 ± 2.41% vs. 18.36 ± 4.42%, P < 0.05). Furthermore, the cell invasion and migration abilities were impaired, and the levels of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related indicators vimentin and N-cadherin were decreased, although the level of E-cadherin was increased after silencing XB130. Western blotting showed that the levels of phosphorylated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and phospho-protein kinase B (p-Akt) also increased, although the level of phosphorylated phosphatase and tensin homolog increased, indicating that XB130 activated the PI3K/Akt pathway. Furthermore, we found that a reduction in XB130 increased liver cancer cell sensitivity to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-induced apoptosis.

Tumor progression was evaluated using xenograft mice model. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers were quantified by both real-time PCR and immunoblotting. The serum content of IL-6 and TNF-α were measured with ELISA kits. Cell proliferation was determined by the Cell Counting Kit-8. Intestinal dysbacteriosis was successfully simulated by the administration of a large dose of antibiotics and was demonstrated to promote xenograft tumor growth and induce EMT. Accordingly, the serum concentrations of cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α were significantly increased. Furthermore, the production and secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α were remarkably elevated in macrophages isolated from intestinal dysbiotic mice in comparison with the normal counterparts, and conditioned medium from these was shown to significantly stimulate EMT process in HT29 cells in vitro. Macrophage depletion completely abrogated the pro-tumor effect of intestinal dysbacteriosis.

Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms underlying the anti-metastasis effect of PON have not yet been completely defined. The present study was designed to uncover the inhibitory effect of PON on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration and invasion of HCT116 cells induced by pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in vitro, and liver metastasis in vivo. Briefly, cell proliferation was assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, followed by wound healing and transwell assays to evaluate cell migration and invasion. The EMT-related molecular markers were determined through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), immunofluorescence (IF), western blot (WB), and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Additionally, WB was used to assess the expression of AKT, phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT), GSK-3β, and phosphorylated GSK-3β (p-GSK-3β). As a result, PON could effectively suppress EMT, migration, and invasion in HCT116 cells in vitro, and liver metastasis of HCT116 cells in vivo. Additionally, PON administration also dramatically altered the expression of EMT-associated markers such as E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and Vimentin, and suppressed the expression of p-AKT, p-GSK-3β and transcription factor, Snail in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the incidence of liver metastasis in the control group was 100% and although the incidence of liver metastasis did not decrease, the number of metastatic nodules in the livers of each PON dose group decreased by (34 ± 4.2)%, (64 ± 3.6)%, and (76 ± 5.3)%, respectively, compared to the control group. Collectively, these findings indicated that targeting the AKT/GSK-3β/Snail pathway by PON might be a promising treatment for TNF-α-induced EMT and metastasis of CRC.",Inflammopharmacology,2019,"['Zhang Z', 'Xu J', 'Liu B', 'Chen F', 'Li J', 'Liu Y', 'Zhu J', 'Shen C']",
30243808,MiR-124-3p suppresses glioma aggressiveness via targeting of Fra-2.,"Malignant glioma is the most common and deadly primary brain tumor in adults. However, the mechanisms underlying the malignancy of glioma remain unclear. In the present study, we found that Fos-related antigen-2 (Fra-2) was overexpressed in most glioma cells, and knockdown of Fra-2 prevented cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Mechanistically, Fra-2 silencing led to a significant reduction in cell-cycle drivers (Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E1), one invasion-associated gene (MMP9), the mesenchymal marker (Vimentin), and induction of the epithelial marker (E-cadherin). Further study confirmed that miR-124-3p decreased the expression of Fra-2 via directly targeting the 3'-UTR, and transfection with miR-124-3p in glioma cells inhibited expression of the above cell-cycle and EMT promoters. Phenotypic experiments also showed that overexpression of Fra-2 weakened the inhibitory effects of miR-124-3p on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of glioma cells. In addition, Fra-2 knockdown impaired the malignant phenotypes enhanced by miR-124-3p inhibition, which suggested a crucial role for the miR-124-3p/Fra-2 pathway in glioma development. Consistently, high expression of Fra-2 was closely associated with low miR-124-3p level and indicated a poor prognosis in patients with glioma. In conclusion, this study indicates the existence of an aberrant miR-124-3p/Fra-2 pathway that results in glioma aggressiveness, which suggests novel therapeutic opportunities for this fatal disease.",Pathol.

30243489,Cancer-associated fibroblasts contribute to oral cancer cells proliferation and metastasis via exosome-mediated paracrine miR-34a-5p.,"BACKGROUND: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play an important role in regulating tumor progression by transferring exosomes to neighboring cells. Our aim was to clarify the role of microRNA encapsulated in the exosomes derived from CAFs in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).
METHODS: We examined the microRNA expression profiles of exosomes derived from CAFs and donor-matched normal fibroblasts (NFs) from patients with OSCC. We used confocal microscopy to examine the transportation of exosomal miR-34a-5p between CAFs and OSCC cells. Next, luciferase reporter and its mutant plasmids were used to confirm direct target gene of miR-34a-5p. Phenotypic assays and in vivo tumor growth experiments were used to investigate the functional significance of exosomal miR-34a-5p.
FINDINGS: We found that the expression of miR-34a-5p in CAF-derived exosomes was significantly reduced, and fibroblasts could transfer exosomal miR-34a-5p to OSCC cells. In xenograft experiments, miR-34a-5p overexpression in CAFs could inhibit the tumorigenesis of OSCC cells. We further revealed that miR-34a-5p binds to its direct downstream target AXL to suppress OSCC cell proliferation and metastasis. Stable ectopic expression of AXL in OSCC cells overexpressing miR-34a-5p restored proliferation and motility abolished by the miRNA. The miR-34a-5p/AXL axis promoted OSCC progression via the AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway, which could induce the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to promote cancer cells metastasis. The miR-34a-5p/AXL axis enhanced nuclear translocation of β-catenin and then induced transcriptional upregulation of SNAIL, which in turn activated both MMP-2 and MMP-9.

30242889,SMC1A is associated with radioresistance in prostate cancer and acts by regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem-like properties.,"Prostate cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers and a pressing health challenge in men worldwide. Radiation therapy (RT) is widely considered a standard therapy for advanced as well as localized prostate cancer. Although this primary therapy is associated with high cancer control rates, up to one-third of patients undergoing radiation therapy becomes radio-resistant and/or has tumor-relapse/recurrence. Therefore, focus on new molecular targets and pathways is essential to develop novel radio-sensitizing agents for the effective and safe treatment of prostate cancer. Here, we describe functional studies that were performed to investigate the role of structural maintenance of chromosome-1 (SMC1A) in radioresistance of metastatic prostate cancer cells. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to suppress SMC1A in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer cells, DU145 and PC3. Clonogenic survival assays, Western blot, RT-PCR, and γ-H2AX staining were used to assess the effect of SMC1A knockdown on radiation sensitivity of these prostate cancer cells. We demonstrate that SMC1A is overexpressed in human prostate tumors compared to the normal adjacent tissue. SMC1A knockdown limits the clonogenic potential, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and cancer stem-like cell (CSC) properties of DU145 and PC3 cells and enhanced efficacy of RT in these cells. Targeted inhibition of SMC1A not only plays a critical role in overcoming radio-resistance in prostate cancer cells, but also suppresses self-renewal and the tumor-propagating potential of x-irradiated cancer cells. We propose that SMC1A could be a potential molecular target for the development of novel radio-sensitizing therapeutic agents for management of radio-resistant metastatic prostate cancer.",Mol.

In this study, we tested our hypothesis that miR-203 inhibits ovarian tumor metastasis by suppressing EMT through targeting BIRC5, using an orthotopic ovarian cancer mouse model.
METHODS: We overexpressed miR-203 in ovarian cancer SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells using a lentiviral vector and examined cell migration and invasion using transwell plates. The small molecule inhibitor, YM155, was used to inhibit survivin expression. miR-203-expressing and control SKOV3 cells were intrabursally injected into immunocompromised NSG female mice. Primary tumors in ovaries and metastatic tumors were collected to determine the expression of survivin and EMT markers using Western blot and immunostaining.
RESULTS: Overexpression of miR-203 inhibits EMT by targeting BIRC5 in ovarian cancer SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells. miR-203 expression enhances the ability of the survivin inhibitor YM155 to reduce tumor cell migration and invasion in vitro. We further showed that miR-203 expression attenuated the TGFβ pathway in both SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells. miR-203 expression also inhibited primary tumor growth in ovaries and metastatic tumors in multiple peritoneal organs including liver and spleen.

30237408,"miR-665 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma cell migration, invasion, and proliferation by decreasing Hippo signaling through targeting PTPRB.","Growing evidence suggests that aberrant microRNA (miRNA) expression contributes to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development and progression. However, the potential role and mechanism of miR-665 in the progression of liver cancer remains largely unknown. Our current study showed that miR-665 expression was upregulated in HCC cells and tissues. High expression of miR-665 exhibited more severe tumor size, vascular invasion and Edmondson grading in HCC patients. Gain- or loss-of-function assays demonstrated that miR-665 promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Tyrosine phosphatase receptor type B (PTPRB) was downregulated in HCC tissues, and was negatively correlated with miR-665 expression. Through western blotting and luciferase reporter assay, PTPRB was identified as a direct downstream target of miR-665. Restoration of PTPRB reverses the effects of miR-665 on HCC migration, invasion, and cell proliferation. A mechanistic study showed that PTPTRB mediated the functional role of miR-665 through regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway. In conclusion, our results suggested that miR-665 was a negative regulator of the PTPRB and could promote tumor proliferation and metastasis in HCC through decreasing Hippo signaling pathway activity, which can be a potential target for HCC treatment.",Cell Death Dis,2018,"['Hu Y', 'Yang C', 'Yang S', 'Cheng F', 'Rao J', 'Wang X']",
30237397,Melittin-induced long non-coding RNA NONHSAT105177 inhibits proliferation and migration of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Previously, we found that melittin treatment suppressed PDAC tumor growth. However, it is unclear whether lncRNAs have any role in the melittin-induced suppression of PDAC. In this study, we used microarray data to identify 844 lncRNAs that were significantly differentially expressed in response to melittin treatment. Of these lncRNAs, we focused on the lncRNA NONHSAT105177, which had about a 22-fold increase in expression with melittin treatment. We found that melittin treatment increased NONHSAT105177 expression in PDAC cell lines but not in normal pancreatic ductal epithelial cell line. NONHSAT105177 expression was significantly lower in PDAC cancer tissues than in adjacent noncancerous tissues. Additionally, overexpression of NONHSAT105177 inhibited PDAC cell proliferation, migration, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), both in vitro and in vivo. Consistent with the mechanism of action of melittin, NONHSAT105177 significantly downregulated cholesterol pathway genes, including Clusterin (CLU). Moreover, we found that NONHSAT105177 trafficking was mediated by exosomes. The combined findings of our current and previous studies suggest that NONHSAT105177 mediated the melittin-induced inhibition of PDAC cell growth and metastasis, which indicated a potential target for developing new strategies.",Cell Death Dis,2018,"['Wang X', 'Li H', 'Lu X', 'Wen C', 'Huo Z', 'Shi M', 'Tang X', 'Chen H', 'Peng C', 'Fang Y', 'Deng X', 'Shen B']",
30237394,MTP18 overexpression contributes to tumor growth and metastasis and associates with poor survival in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: Human MTP18 (mitochondrial protein 18 kDa) is a novel nuclear-encoded mitochondrial membrane protein that is involved in controlling mitochondrial fission. Our bioinformatic analysis of TCGA data revealed an aberrant overexpression of MTP18 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We analyzed its biological effects and prognostic significance in this malignancy.
METHODS: MTP18 expression was evaluated by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis in 20 paired tumor and peritumor tissues. Clinical impact of MTP18 overexpression was assessed in 156 patients with HCC. The effects of MTP18 knockdown or overexpression on cell growth and metastasis were determined by cell proliferation, colony formation, cell cycle, apoptosis, migration, and invasion assays. Furthermore, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which MTP18 overexpression promoted HCC cell growth and metastasis were explored.
RESULTS: MTP18 was commonly overexpressed in HCC tissues mainly due to the downregulation of miR-125b, which significantly contributed to poor prognosis of HCC patients. Functional experiments revealed that MTP18 promoted both the growth and metastasis of HCC cells by inducing the progression of cell cycle, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and production of MMP-9, and suppressing cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, increased mitochondrial fission and subsequent ROS production was found to be involved in the promotion of growth and metastasis by MTP18 in HCC cells.
CONCLUSIONS: MTP18 plays a pivotal oncogenic role in hepatocellular carcinogenesis; its overexpression may serve as a novel prognostic factor and a therapeutic target in HCC.",Cell Death Dis,2018,"['Zhang Y', 'Li H', 'Chang H', 'Du L', 'Hai J', 'Geng X', 'Yan X']",
30236600,The cigarette smoke components induced the cell proliferation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition via production of reactive oxygen species in endometrial adenocarcinoma cells.,"Cigarette smoke (CS) causes about 480,000 deaths each year worldwide and is well-known to have harmful effects on the human body, leading to heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, and cardiovascular problems. In the present study, the effects of acrylonitrile (AN), benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P), formaldehyde (FOR), isoprene (ISO), nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone (NNK), which are the main components of CS, on the proliferation, invasion, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process of human Ishikawa endometrial adenocarcinoma cells were investigated. Treating Ishikawa cells with CS components resulted in increased cell growth and altered expression of cell cycle-related genes: the protein expression of cyclin D & E increased, while the levels of p21 & p27 were reduced following treatment of these five CS components. In addition, CS components increased the invasion capacity of Ishikawa cells. The expression of the epithelial markers, E-cadherin and occludin, were significantly decreased, while the expression of the mesenchymal marker, N-cadherin, was significantly increased by CS components. In dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA) assay, ROS production increased by treatment of CS components. The CS components activated the ROS-p38 MAPK-EMT pathway by increasing the level of phosphorylated p38 MAPK and p44/42 (ERK1/2), and by up-regulating Snail and Slug, the transcription factors for EMT. Taken together, these results indicate that CS components can promote progression of endometrial adenocarcinoma via increasing cell proliferation and the ROS-mediated EMT process.",Food Chem.

30234394,"Interferon-α Combined With Herbal Compound ""Songyou Yin"" Effectively Inhibits the Increased Invasiveness and Metastasis by Insufficient Radiofrequency Ablation of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in an Animal Model.","OBJECTIVE: We had previously proved that insufficient radiofrequency ablation (RFA) could enhance invasiveness and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is mediated by activating β-catenin signaling. Thus, the aim of the present study was to demonstrate whether the combined treatment of interferon-α (IFN-α) and ""Songyou Yin"" (SYY) minimizes the pro-metastatic effects of insufficient RFA, as well as to explore its underlying mechanism.
METHODS: Insufficient RFA was performed in an orthotopic nude mice model of HCCLM3 with high metastatic potential. The effects of IFN-α, SYY, and combined IFN-α and SYY were observed in the animal model. Tumor sizes, lung metastasis, and survival time were assessed. Immunochemistry staining, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot were used to examine gene expression related to metastasis and angiogenesis in residual cancer after insufficient RFA.
RESULTS: For up to 8 weeks of treatment, the combined therapy significantly decreased the residual cancer sizes, minimized the lung metastasis rate, and prolonged the survival time of nude mice, which might be due to suppression of the EMT via β-catenin signal blockade, in addition to attenuating angiogenesis in residual cancer after insufficient RFA.
CONCLUSION: IFN-α combined with SYY significantly weakened the enhanced metastatic potential of residual cancer after insufficient RFA by attenuating EMT, which is mediated through inhibiting activation of β-catenin. In addition, decreasing angiogenesis of residual cancer might also play a certain role.",Integr Cancer Ther,2018,"['Zhang N', 'Wang LR', 'Li DD', 'Ma DN', 'Wang CH', 'He XG', 'Gao DM', 'Wang L', 'Tang ZY']",
30231971,YAP drives cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma formation and progression.,"Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) can progress to malignant metastatic cancer, including an aggressive subtype known as spindle cell carcinoma (spSCC). spSCC formation involves epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), yet the molecular basis of this event remains unknown. The transcriptional co-activator YAP undergoes recurrent amplification in human SCC and overexpression of YAP drives SCC formation in mice. Here, we show that human spSCC tumours also feature strong nuclear localisation of YAP and overexpression of activated YAP (NLS-YAP-5SA) with Keratin-5 (K5-CreERt) is sufficient to induce rapid formation of both SCC and spSCC in mice. spSCC tumours arise at sites of epithelial scratch wounding, where tumour-initiating epithelial cells undergo EMT to generate spSCC. Expression of the EMT transcription factor ZEB1 arises upon wounding and is a defining characteristic of spSCC in mice and humans. Thus, the wound healing response synergises with YAP to drive metaplastic transformation of SCC to spSCC.",Elife,2018,"['Vincent-Mistiaen Z', 'Elbediwy A', 'Vanyai H', 'Cotton J', 'Stamp G', 'Nye E', 'Spencer-Dene B', 'Thomas GJ', 'Mao J', 'Thompson B']",
30231922,HSCs-derived COMP drives hepatocellular carcinoma progression by activating MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways.,"BACKGROUND: Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) is known to promote fibrosis in skin, lung and liver. Emerging evidence shows that COMP plays critical roles in tumor development, including breast cancer, colon cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nevertheless, the role of COMP in HCC proliferation and metastasis and its underlying mechanisms remain fully unclear.
METHODS: Serum COMP was determined by ELISA. Cell Counting Kit-8 and plate colony formation were performed to evaluate cell proliferation. Wound healing and transwell assays were used to determine migration and invasion of HCC cells. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were carried out for detection of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and MMPs in HCC cells. The in vivo role of COMP was evaluated using mouse models. We also measured effects of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs)-conditioned medium (CM) on HCC progression using transwell coculture system.
RESULTS: Here, we found that serum COMP levels in HCC patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls. Accordingly, high serum COMP levels in HCC patients significantly correlated with malignant clinical characteristics and poor clinical outcomes. Next, we investigated that recombinant human COMP protein (rCOMP) treatment resulted in increased abilities of proliferation, invasion and migration of HCC cells. Furthermore, rCOMP treatment enhanced proliferative and metastatic colonization of HCC cells in vivo. Mechanistically, CD36 receptor played an essential role in COMP-mediated HCC cell proliferation and metastasis. Functionally, COMP/CD36 signaling caused phosphorylation of ERK and AKT, resulting in the upregulation of tumor-progressive genes such as EMT markers, MMP-2/9, Slug and Twist in HCC cells. Interestingly, we revealed that COMP was secreted by HSCs. CM of LX2 cells with COMP knockdown showed weaker effects on the activation of MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways in HCC cells compared to control CM.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that HSCs-derived COMP collaborated with CD36 and subsequently played an essential role in MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT-mediated HCC progression. COMP might act as a promising target for the diagnosis and treatment of aggressive HCC.",J. Exp. Clin.

30231243,FSCN1 Promotes Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Through Increasing Snail1 in Ovarian Cancer Cells.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is one of the key mechanisms mediating cancer progression. Snail1 has a pivotal role in the regulation of EMT, involving the loss of E-cadherin and concomitant upregulation of vimentin, among other biomarkers. We have found FSCN1 promoted EMT in ovarian cancer cells, but the precise mechanism of FSCN1 in EMT process has not been clearly elucidated.
METHODS: The levels of FSCN1 and snail1 were determined in epithelial ovarian cancer(EOC) specimen and in ovarian cancer cells by RT-qPCR. The changes of EMT makers and effects on snail1 by FSCN1 were examined by overexpression or depletion of FSCN1 in EOC cells by RT-qPCR and western blotting. The invasiveness of the FSCN1-modified EOC cells was examined in transwell assay. Co-immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed to detect the interaction between snail1 and FSCN1 in EOC cells.
RESULTS: We found FSCN1 and snail1 significantly increased in EOC, and especially in EOC with metastasis. FSCN1 was positively correlated with snail1 expression at the cellular/histological levels. Moreover, we further showed that FSCN1 physiologically interacted with and increased the levels of snail1 to promote ovarian cancer cell EMT.
CONCLUSION: FSCN1 promote EMT through snail1 in ovarian cancer cells. FSCN1 is an attractive novel target for inhibiting invasion and metastasis of EOC cells.",Cell. Physiol. Biochem.,2018,"['Li J', 'Zhang S', 'Pei M', 'Wu L', 'Liu Y', 'Li H', 'Lu J', 'Li X']",
30230945,MicroRNA-886-3P functions as a tumor suppressor in small cell lung cancer.,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive disease and miRNAs may play an important role in modulating SCLC progression. We have previously screened 924 miRNAs and found that miR-886-3P was negatively associated with SCLC survival. In the current study, we further investigated the role of miR-886-3P mimic in regulating SCLC cell phenotypic alteration in vitro and xenograft tumor formation in vivo. We found that transfection of miR-886-3P mimic significantly inhibited SCLC cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation, and induced mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) by suppressing TGF-ß1 synthesis in vitro. Furthermore, intra-tumor injection of miR-886-3P mimic lead to necrosis and suppression of tumor invasion to the surrounding tissue in the subcutaneous xenograft tumor, and intra-vein injection of miR-886-3P mimic suppressed xenograft lung cancer growth in vivo. These findings suggested that miR-886-3P functions as a tumor suppressor in SCLC and thus, it might be a potential therapeutic molecule in the treatment of lung cancer.",Cancer Biol.

30229820,The increase of miR-27a affects the role of cisplatin on proliferation and migration capacities of liver cancer cells.,"OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of chronic virus-mediated micro ribonucleic acid miR-27a on proliferation and migration capacities of liver cancer cells.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 60 patients with primary liver cancer from January 2015 to December 2016 were selected as observation group, 60 patients with chronic liver disease were selected as control group, and another 60 healthy subjects who received physical examination during the same period were selected as healthy group. All patients received serum miRNA detection. The different expressions of serum miRNAs in healthy people, patients with chronic liver disease, and patients with liver cancer were analyzed. The correlations of miR-27a with growth and proliferation of liver cancer MCC-7721 cells were studied.
RESULTS: The levels of miR-27a and miR-664b in subjects in control group and healthy group were significantly lower than those in observation group, but the expression levels of miR-30a were statistically elevated (p<0.05). The expression of serum miR-27a in liver cancer patients with higher tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging (stage III-IV, number of tumors >1, tumor size >5 cm, and vascular invasion) was significantly higher than those in patients with lower TNM staging (stage I-II, number of tumors =1, tumor size ≤5 cm, and no vascular invasion) (p<0.05). At 48 h and 72 h after transfection, the proliferation of liver cancer MCC-7721 cells was significantly enhanced compared to that in non-transfection group (p<0.05). The level of miR-27a was significantly upregulated in cisplatin-resistant liver cancer A549/CDDP cells compared with that in parental A549 cells. MiR-27a regulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cisplatin resistance in vitro, while modulated the in vivo response of liver cancer cells to cisplatin. Further studies identified the Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) as a direct and functional target of miR-27a. The knockdown of RKIP by RNAi showed a similar effect to ectopic miR-27a expression, whereas the over-expression of RKIP weakened the function of miR-27a in liver cancer cells.
CONCLUSIONS: MiR-27a participated in the proliferation and migration capacities of liver cancer cells and influenced the effect of cisplatin via targeting RKIP. The high expression of miR-27a is closely related to the malignant degree of liver cancer, which provides guidance for the diagnosis, targeted therapy, and prognostic evaluation of liver cancer.",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,2018,"['Li W', 'Yu ZX', 'Ma BF']",
30229551,Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and Prostate Cancer.,"Typically the normal epithelial cells are a single layer, held tightly by adherent proteins that prevent the mobilization of the cells from the monolayer sheet. During prostate cancer progression, the epithelial cells can undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition or EMT, characterized by morphological changes in their phenotype from cuboidal to spindle-shaped. This is associated with biochemical changes in which epithelial cell markers such as E-cadherin and occludins are down-regulated, which leads to loss of cell-cell adhesion, while mesenchymal markers such as vimentin and N-cadherin are up-regulated, thereby allowing the cells to migrate or metastasize to different organs. The EMT transition can be regulated directly and indirectly by multiple molecular mechanisms including growth factors and cytokines such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF), and signaling pathways such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase (PI3K). This signaling subsequently induces expression of various transcription factors like Snail, Twist, Zeb1/2, that are also known as master regulators of EMT. Various markers associated with EMT have been reported in prostate cancer patient tissue as well as a possible association with health disparities. There has been consideration to therapeutically target EMT in prostate cancer patients by targeting the EMT signaling pathways.",Adv. Exp. Med.

Recently, a natural flavonoid known as 2'‑hydroxyflavanone (2HF) exerts remarkable anticancer activity on various types of cancer. Our previous study demonstrated that 2HF could promote apoptosis and inhibit the proliferation of PCa cells, but whether 2HF is involved in the regulation of EMT, and cell migration and invasion in metastatic PCa remains unknown. The present study used two different metastatic PCa cell lines (PC‑3 and DU145) to investigate the effects of 2HF on EMT, and cell migration and invasion. The results demonstrated that 2HF could inhibit EMT, and cell migration and invasion through the Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway by suppressing GSK‑3β phosphorylation, β‑catenin expression and transactivation. In conclusion, the present study revealed a novel function of 2HF, which may be used to prevent or treat PCa metastasis.",Oncol.

30226589,miR-17-92 functions as an oncogene and modulates NF-κB signaling by targeting TRAF3 in MGC-803 human gastric cancer cells.,"The miR-17-92 cluster plays either an oncogenic or anti-oncogenic role in cancer progression in diverse human cancers. However, the underlying mechanisms of the miR-17-92 cluster in gastric cancer have not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, the function of the miR-17-92 cluster in diverse aspects of MGC-803 gastric cancer cells was systematically elucidated. The enforced introduction of the miR-17-92 cluster into the MGC-803 cells significantly promoted cell growth due to the increased cellular proliferation and decreased cellular apoptosis, which were detected by CCK-8, cell viability and TUNEL assays. Moreover, the results of western blot analyses revealed that the activated protein kinase B (AKT), extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and nuclear factor (NF-κB) signaling pathways were activated in these processes. Moreover, the overexpression of the miR-17-92 cluster markedly enhanced the migratory and invasive abilities of the MGC-803 cells, which was associated with the occurrence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 3 (TRAF3), which negatively regulates the NF-κB signaling pathway, was identified as a direct target of miR-17-92. Furthermore, TRAF3 silencing enhanced the oncogenic functions of the miR-17-92 cluster in the MGC-803 cells, including the increased cellular proliferation, migration and invasion. Moreover, immunohistochemical staining and survival analyses of a gastric cancer tissue microarray revealed that TRAF3 functioned as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer. Taken together, the findings of this study provide new insight into the specific biological functions of the miR-17-92 cluster in gastric cancer progression by directly targeting TRAF3.",Int. J.
