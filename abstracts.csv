31877331,Epigenetic sensitization of pregnane X receptor-regulated gene expression by dimethyl sulfoxide.,"Prior exposures to chemicals/agents may alter epigenome in such a way that subsequent exposure to the same or different xenobiotic would produce different responses. Understanding the mechanism for this ""priming"" effect is of clinical significance in avoiding adverse drug-drug interactions. Here we reported a dramatic priming effect of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) on pregnane X receptor (PXR)-mediated gene regulations and analyzed the underpinning epigenetic mechanism. We showed that DMSO (1.25-2.5 %) pretreatment has a profound effect in enhancing the expression of PXR target genes. This priming effect persisted up to 48 h. Mechanistically, DMSO pretreatment reduced H4K12 acetylation and therefore enhanced the subsequent rifampicin stimulated histone H4R3 methylation on the regulatory region of PXR target gene CYP3A4. We showed that protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), which methylates H4R3, was important for priming by DMSO. Inhibition of methyltransferase by the pharmacological inhibitor adenosine dialehyde (AdoX), or RNAi knockdown of PRMT1, abolished the DMSO priming effects. On the other hand, Trichostation A (TSA) pretreatment, which increases histone acetylation and therefore suppresses H4R3 methylation, also abolished the DMSO priming effects. Based on the above observation, we proposed a model of sequential order of histone methylation and acetylation on the transcription ""relay"".",Toxicol.

31784732,Histone hyperacetylation disrupts core gene regulatory architecture in rhabdomyosarcoma.,"Core regulatory transcription factors (CR TFs) orchestrate the placement of super-enhancers (SEs) to activate transcription of cell-identity specifying gene networks, and are critical in promoting cancer. Here, we define the core regulatory circuitry of rhabdomyosarcoma and identify critical CR TF dependencies. These CR TFs build SEs that have the highest levels of histone acetylation, yet paradoxically the same SEs also harbor the greatest amounts of histone deacetylases. We find that hyperacetylation selectively halts CR TF transcription. To investigate the architectural determinants of this phenotype, we used absolute quantification of architecture (AQuA) HiChIP, which revealed erosion of native SE contacts, and aberrant spreading of contacts that involved histone acetylation. Hyperacetylation removes RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) from core regulatory genetic elements, and eliminates RNA Pol II but not BRD4 phase condensates. This study identifies an SE-specific requirement for balancing histone modification states to maintain SE architecture and CR TF transcription.",Nat.

Here, we mapped the genomic and transcriptomic changes in human MCs upon diverse stimuli. Our analyses revealed broad H3K4me3 domains and enhancers associated with activation.

31580889,"Side-chain oxysterols suppress the transcription of CTP: Phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase by inhibiting the interaction of p300 and NF-Y, and H3K27 acetylation.","CTP: phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (Pcyt2) is the rate-limiting enzyme in mammalian phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) biosynthesis. Previously, we reported that increasedPcyt2 mRNA levels after serum starvation are suppressed by 25-hydroxycholesterol (HC) (25-HC), and that nuclear factor-Y (NF-Y) is involved in the inhibitory effects. Transcription of Hmgcr, which encodes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, is suppressed in the same manner. However, no typical sterol regulatory element (SRE) was detected in the Pcyt2 promoter. We were therefore interested in the effect of 25-HC on the modification of histones and thus treated cells with histone acetyltransferase inhibitor (anacardic acid) or histone deacetylase inhibitor (trichostatin A). The suppressive effect of 25-HC on Pcyt2 and Hmgcr mRNA transcription was ameliorated by trichostatin A. Anacardic acid, 25-HC and 24(S)-HC suppressed their transcription by inhibiting H3K27 acetylation in their promoters as evaluated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. 27-HC, 22(S)-HC and 22(R)-HC also suppressed their transcription, but 7α-HC, 7β-HC, the synthetic LXR agonist T0901317 and cholesterol did not. Furthermore, 25-HC inhibited p300 recruitment to the Pcyt2 and Hmgcr promoters, and suppressed H3K27 acetylation. 25-HC in the medium was easily conducted into cells. Based on these results, we concluded that 25-HC (and other side-chain oxysterols) in the medium was easily transferred into cells, suppressed H3K27 acetylation via p300 recruitment on the NF-Y complex in the Pcyt2 and Hmgcr promoters, and then suppressed transcription of these genes although LXR is not involved.",J.

31551414,Identification of the PTEN-ARID4B-PI3K pathway reveals the dependency on ARID4B by PTEN-deficient prostate cancer.,"PTEN is frequently mutated in prostate cancer. The tumor suppressor function of PTEN is attributed to its lipid phosphatase activity that counters PI3K action. Here, we report a PTEN-ARID4B-PI3K axis in which PTEN inhibits expression of ARID4B, while ARID4B is a transcriptional activator of the PI3K subunit genes PIK3CA and PIK3R2 that are crucial for activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Reciprocal binding of ARID4B and histone H1 to the PIK3CA and PIK3R2 promoters modulates chromatin condensation, suggesting a mechanism by which ARID4B activates these promoters. Functional analyses reveals that ARID4B is required for prostate tumorigenesis when PTEN is deficient. The biological significance is further substantiated by the existence of a PTEN/ARID4B/PIK3CA three-gene signature that improves the predictive power for prostate cancer recurrence in patients. In summary, we identify ARID4B as a master regulator in the PTEN-PI3K pathway, thus providing a potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer carrying PTEN mutations.",Nat Commun,2019,"['Wu RC', 'Young IC', 'Chen YF', 'Chuang ST', 'Toubaji A', 'Wu MY']"
31550663,A drug repurposing screening reveals a novel epigenetic activity of hydroxychloroquine.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable hematological malignancy driven by several genetic and epigenetic alterations. The hyperactivation of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), a multi-subunit oncogenic histone methyltransferase, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of this malignancy. Upon protein-protein interaction (PPI) between the catalytic subunit EZH2 and EED, PRC2 primarily methylates lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3), thus modulating the chromatin structure and inducing transcriptional repression. Herein, we highlight a new mechanism of action that can contribute to explain the anti-tumor activity of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an anti-malaric agent also known as autophagy inhibitor. By structural studies, we demonstrate that HCQ inhibits the allosteric binding of PRC2 to EED within the H3K27me3-binding pocket, thus antagonizing the PRC2 catalytic activity. In silico results are compatible with the significant reduction of the H3K27me3 levels in MM cells exerted by HCQ. Overall, these findings disclose a novel epigenetic activity of HCQ with potential implications for its clinical repositioning.",Eur J Med Chem,2019,"['Catalano R', 'Rocca R', 'Juli G', 'Costa G', 'Maruca A', 'Artese A', 'Caracciolo D', 'Tagliaferri P', 'Alcaro S', 'Tassone P', 'Amodio N']"
31537782,TRIM66 reads unmodified H3R2K4 and H3K56ac to respond to DNA damage in embryonic stem cells.,"Recognition of specific chromatin modifications by distinct structural domains within ""reader"" proteins plays a critical role in the maintenance of genomic stability. However, the specific mechanisms involved in this process remain unclear. Here we report that the PHD-Bromo tandem domain of tripartite motif-containing 66 (TRIM66) recognizes the unmodified H3R2-H3K4 and acetylated H3K56. The aberrant deletion of Trim66 results in severe DNA damage and genomic instability in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Moreover, we find that the recognition of histone modification by TRIM66 is critical for DNA damage repair (DDR) in ESCs. TRIM66 recruits Sirt6 to deacetylate H3K56ac, negatively regulating the level of H3K56ac and facilitating the initiation of DDR. Importantly, Trim66-deficient blastocysts also exhibit higher levels of H3K56ac and DNA damage. Collectively, the present findings indicate the vital role of TRIM66 in DDR in ESCs, establishing the relationship between histone readers and maintenance of genomic stability.",Nat Commun,2019,"['Chen J', 'Wang Z', 'Guo X', 'Li F', 'Wei Q', 'Chen X', 'Gong D', 'Xu Y', 'Chen W', 'Liu Y', 'Kang J', 'Shi Y']"
31515493,Nuclear decoupling is part of a rapid protein-level cellular response to high-intensity mechanical loading.,"Studies of cellular mechano-signaling have often utilized static models that do not fully replicate the dynamics of living tissues. Here, we examine the time-dependent response of primary human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) to cyclic tensile strain (CTS). At low-intensity strain (1 h, 4% CTS at 1 Hz), cell characteristics mimic responses to increased substrate stiffness. As the strain regime is intensified (frequency increased to 5 Hz), we characterize rapid establishment of a broad, structured and reversible protein-level response, even as transcription is apparently downregulated. Protein abundance is quantified coincident with changes to protein conformation and post-translational modification (PTM). Furthermore, we characterize changes to the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex that bridges the nuclear envelope, and specifically to levels and PTMs of Sad1/UNC-84 (SUN) domain-containing protein 2 (SUN2). The result of this regulation is to decouple mechano-transmission between the cytoskeleton and the nucleus, thus conferring protection to chromatin.",Nat Commun,2019,"['Gilbert HTJ', 'Mallikarjun V', 'Dobre O', 'Jackson MR', 'Pedley R', 'Gilmore AP', 'Richardson SM', 'Swift J']"
31488577,Automethylation of PRC2 promotes H3K27 methylation and is impaired in H3K27M pediatric glioma.,"The histone methyltransferase activity of PRC2 is central to the formation of H3K27me3-decorated facultative heterochromatin and gene silencing. In addition, PRC2 has been shown to automethylate its core subunits, EZH1/EZH2 and SUZ12. Here, we identify the lysine residues at which EZH1/EZH2 are automethylated with EZH2-K510 and EZH2-K514 being the major such sites in vivo. Automethylated EZH2/PRC2 exhibits a higher level of histone methyltransferase activity and is required for attaining proper cellular levels of H3K27me3. While occurring independently of PRC2 recruitment to chromatin, automethylation promotes PRC2 accessibility to the histone H3 tail. Intriguingly, EZH2 automethylation is significantly reduced in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) cells that carry a lysine-to-methionine substitution in histone H3 (H3K27M), but not in cells that carry either EZH2 or EED mutants that abrogate PRC2 allosteric activation, indicating that H3K27M impairs the intrinsic activity of PRC2. Our study demonstrates a PRC2 self-regulatory mechanism through its EZH1/2-mediated automethylation activity.",Genes Dev.,2019,"['Lee CH', 'Yu JR', 'Granat J', 'Saldaña-Meyer R', 'Andrade J', 'LeRoy G', 'Jin Y', 'Lund P', 'Stafford JM', 'Garcia BA', 'Ueberheide B', 'Reinberg D']"
31451685,EZHIP constrains Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 activity in germ cells.,"The Polycomb group of proteins is required for the proper orchestration of gene expression due to its role in maintaining transcriptional silencing. It is composed of several chromatin modifying complexes, including Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which deposits H3K27me2/3. Here, we report the identification of a cofactor of PRC2, EZHIP (EZH1/2 Inhibitory Protein), expressed predominantly in the gonads. EZHIP limits the enzymatic activity of PRC2 and lessens the interaction between the core complex and its accessory subunits, but does not interfere with PRC2 recruitment to chromatin. Deletion of Ezhip in mice leads to a global increase in H3K27me2/3 deposition both during spermatogenesis and at late stages of oocyte maturation. This does not affect the initial number of follicles but is associated with a reduction of follicles in aging. Our results suggest that mature oocytes Ezhip-/- might not be fully functional and indicate that fertility is strongly impaired in Ezhip-/- females. Altogether, our study uncovers EZHIP as a regulator of chromatin landscape in gametes.",Nat Commun,2019,"['Ragazzini R', 'Pérez-Palacios R', 'Baymaz IH', 'Diop S', 'Ancelin K', 'Zielinski D', 'Michaud A', 'Givelet M', 'Borsos M', 'Aflaki S', 'Legoix P', 'Jansen PWTC', 'Servant N', 'Torres-Padilla ME', ""Bourc'his D"", 'Fouchet P', 'Vermeulen M', 'Margueron R']"
31434880,Genotoxic stress-triggered β-catenin/JDP2/PRMT5 complex facilitates reestablishing glutathione homeostasis.,"The mechanisms underlying how cells subjected to genotoxic stress reestablish reduction-oxidation (redox) homeostasis to scavenge genotoxic stress-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), which maintains the physiological function of cellular processes and cell survival, remain unclear. Herein, we report that, via a TCF-independent mechanism, genotoxic stress induces the enrichment of β-catenin in chromatin, where it forms a complex with ATM phosphorylated-JDP2 and PRMT5. This elicits histone H3R2me1/H3R2me2s-induced transcriptional activation by the recruitment of the WDR5/MLL methyltransferase complexes and concomitant H3K4 methylation at the promoters of multiple genes in GSH-metabolic cascade. Treatment with OICR-9429, a small-molecule antagonist of the WDR5-MLL interaction, inhibits the β-catenin/JDP2/PRMT5 complex-reestablished GSH metabolism, leading to a lethal increase in the already-elevated levels of ROS in the genotoxic-agent treated cancer cells. Therefore, our results unveil a plausible role for β-catenin in reestablishing redox homeostasis upon genotoxic stress and shed light on the mechanisms of inducible chemotherapy resistance in cancer.",Nat Commun,2019,"['Cao L', 'Wu G', 'Zhu J', 'Tan Z', 'Shi D', 'Wu X', 'Tang M', 'Li Z', 'Hu Y', 'Zhang S', 'Yu R', 'Mo S', 'Wu J', 'Song E', 'Li M', 'Song L', 'Li J']"
31431618,Mapping histone modifications in low cell number and single cells using antibody-guided chromatin tagmentation (ACT-seq).,"Modern next-generation sequencing-based methods have empowered researchers to assay the epigenetic states of individual cells. Existing techniques for profiling epigenetic marks in single cells often require the use and optimization of time-intensive procedures such as drop fluidics, chromatin fragmentation, and end repair. Here we describe ACT-seq, a streamlined method for mapping genome-wide distributions of histone tail modifications, histone variants, and chromatin-binding proteins in a small number of or single cells. ACT-seq utilizes a fusion of Tn5 transposase to Protein A that is targeted to chromatin by a specific antibody, allowing chromatin fragmentation and sequence tag insertion specifically at genomic sites presenting the relevant antigen. The Tn5 transposase enables the use of an index multiplexing strategy (iACT-seq), which enables construction of thousands of single-cell libraries in one day by a single researcher without the need for drop-based fluidics or visual sorting. We conclude that ACT-seq present an attractive alternative to existing techniques for mapping epigenetic marks in single cells.",Nat Commun,2019,"['Carter B', 'Ku WL', 'Kang JY', 'Hu G', 'Perrie J', 'Tang Q', 'Zhao K']"
31420217,One-Carbon Metabolism Supports S-Adenosylmethionine and Histone Methylation to Drive Inflammatory Macrophages.,"Activated macrophages adapt their metabolic pathways to drive the pro-inflammatory phenotype, but little is known about the biochemical underpinnings of this process. Here, we find that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activates the pentose phosphate pathway, the serine synthesis pathway, and one-carbon metabolism, the synergism of which drives epigenetic reprogramming for interleukin-1β (IL-1β) expression. Glucose-derived ribose and one-carbon units fed by both glucose and serine metabolism are synergistically integrated into the methionine cycle through de novo ATP synthesis and fuel the generation of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) during LPS-induced inflammation. Impairment of these metabolic pathways that feed SAM generation lead to anti-inflammatory outcomes, implicating SAM as an essential metabolite for inflammatory macrophages. Mechanistically, SAM generation maintains a relatively high SAM:S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio to support histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation for IL-1β production. We therefore identify a synergistic effect of glucose and amino acid metabolism on orchestrating SAM availability that is intimately linked to the chromatin state for inflammation.",Mol.

31408999,Epigenetic Regulation of Adipogenic Differentiation by Histone Lysine Demethylation.,"Obesity is a rising public health problem that contributes to the development of several metabolic diseases and cancer. Adipocyte precursors outside of adipose depots that expand due to overweight and obesity may have a negative impact on human health. Determining how progenitor cells acquire a preadipocyte commitment and become mature adipocytes remains a significant challenge. Over the past several years, we have learned that the establishment of cellular identity is widely influenced by changes in histone marks, which in turn modulate chromatin structure. In this regard, histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) are now emerging as key players that shape chromatin through their ability to demethylate almost all major histone methylation sites. Recent research has shown that KDMs orchestrate the chromatin landscape, which mediates the activation of adipocyte-specific genes. In addition, KDMs have functions in addition to their enzymatic activity, which are beginning to be revealed, and their dysregulation seems to be related to the development of metabolic disorders. In this review, we highlight the biological functions of KDMs that contribute to the establishment of a permissive or repressive chromatin environment during the mesenchymal stem cell transition into adipocytes. Understanding how KDMs regulate adipogenesis might prompt the development of new strategies for fighting obesity-related diseases.",Int J Mol Sci,2019,"['Nic-Can GI', 'Rodas-Junco BA', 'Carrillo-Cocom LM', 'Zepeda-Pedreguera A', 'Peñaloza-Cuevas R', 'Aguilar-Ayala FJ', 'Rojas-Herrera RA']"
31399344,The Histone Deacetylase SIRT6 Restrains Transcription Elongation via Promoter-Proximal Pausing.,"Transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes occurs at promoter-proximal regions wherein transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pauses before proceeding toward productive elongation. The role of chromatin in pausing remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the histone deacetylase SIRT6 binds to Pol II and prevents the release of the negative elongation factor (NELF), thus stabilizing Pol II promoter-proximal pausing. Genetic depletion of SIRT6 or its chromatin deficiency upon glucose deprivation causes intragenic enrichment of acetylated histone H3 at lysines 9 (H3K9ac) and 56 (H3K56ac), activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9)-that phosphorylates NELF and the carboxyl terminal domain of Pol II-and enrichment of the positive transcription elongation factors MYC, BRD4, PAF1, and the super elongation factors AFF4 and ELL2. These events lead to increased expression of genes involved in metabolism, protein synthesis, and embryonic development. Our results identified SIRT6 as a Pol II promoter-proximal pausing-dedicated histone deacetylase.",Mol.

31383640,PHF19 promotes multiple myeloma tumorigenicity through PRC2 activation and broad H3K27me3 domain formation.,"Dysregulation of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) promotes oncogenesis partly through its enzymatic function for inducing trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3). However, it remains to be determined how PRC2 activity is regulated in normal and diseased settings. We here report a PRC2-associated cofactor, PHD finger protein 19 (PHF19; also known as polycomb-like 3), as a crucial mediator of tumorigenicity in multiple myeloma (MM). Overexpression and/or genomic amplification of PHF19 is found associated with malignant progression of MM and plasma cell leukemia, correlating to worse treatment outcomes. Using various MM models, we demonstrated a critical requirement of PHF19 for tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, PHF19-mediated oncogenic effect relies on its PRC2-interacting and chromatin-binding functions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing profiling showed a critical role for PHF19 in maintaining the H3K27me3 landscape. PHF19 depletion led to loss of broad H3K27me3 domains, possibly due to impaired H3K27me3 spreading from cytosine guanine dinucleotide islands, which is reminiscent to the reported effect of an ""onco""-histone mutation, H3K27 to methionine (H3K27M). RNA-sequencing-based transcriptome profiling in MM lines also demonstrated a requirement of PHF19 for optimal silencing of PRC2 targets, which include cell cycle inhibitors and interferon-JAK-STAT signaling genes critically involved in tumor suppression. Correlation studies using patient sample data sets further support a clinical relevance of the PHF19-regulated pathways. Lastly, we show that MM cells are generally sensitive to PRC2 inhibitors. Collectively, this study demonstrates that PHF19 promotes MM tumorigenesis through enhancing H3K27me3 deposition and PRC2's gene-regulatory functions, lending support for PRC2 blockade as a means for MM therapeutics.",Blood,2019,"['Ren Z', 'Ahn JH', 'Liu H', 'Tsai YH', 'Bhanu NV', 'Koss B', 'Allison DF', 'Ma A', 'Storey AJ', 'Wang P', 'Mackintosh SG', 'Edmondson RD', 'Groen RWJ', 'Martens AC', 'Garcia BA', 'Tackett AJ', 'Jin J', 'Cai L', 'Zheng D', 'Wang GG']"
31363749,KDM2 proteins constrain transcription from CpG island gene promoters independently of their histone demethylase activity.,"CpG islands (CGIs) are associated with the majority of mammalian gene promoters and function to recruit chromatin modifying enzymes. It has therefore been proposed that CGIs regulate gene expression through chromatin-based mechanisms, however in most cases this has not been directly tested. Here, we reveal that the histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) demethylase activity of the CGI-binding KDM2 proteins contributes only modestly to the H3K36me2-depleted state at CGI-associated gene promoters and is dispensable for normal gene expression. Instead, we discover that KDM2 proteins play a widespread and demethylase-independent role in constraining gene expression from CGI-associated gene promoters. We further show that KDM2 proteins shape RNA Polymerase II occupancy but not chromatin accessibility at CGI-associated promoters. Together this reveals a demethylase-independent role for KDM2 proteins in transcriptional repression and uncovers a new function for CGIs in constraining gene expression.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2019,"['Turberfield AH', 'Kondo T', 'Nakayama M', 'Koseki Y', 'King HW', 'Koseki H', 'Klose RJ']"
31357933,Cut-C: cleavage under tethered nuclease for conformational capture.,"BACKGROUND: Deciphering the 3D structure of the genome is essential for elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression in detail. Existing methods, such as chromosome conformation capture (3C) and Hi-C have enabled the identification of novel aspects of chromatin structure. Further identification of protein-centric chromatin conformation is enabled by coupling the Hi-C procedure with a conventional chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. However, these methods are time-consuming and require independent methods for validation.
RESULTS: To simultaneously identify protein-centric chromatin conformation and target protein localization, we have developed Cut-C, a method that combines antibody-mediated cleavage by tethered nuclease with chromosome conformation capture to identify chromatin interactions mediated by a protein of interest. Applying Cut-C to H3K4me3, a histone modification enriched at active gene promoters, we have successfully identified chromatin loops mediated by H3K4me3 along with the genome-wide distribution of H3K4me3. Cut-C also identified chromatin loops mediated by CTCF, validating the general applicability of the method.
CONCLUSIONS: Cut-C identifies protein-centric chromatin conformations along with the genome-wide distribution of target proteins using simple procedures.

Here, we evaluated the ability of oleacein, a biophenol secoiridoid naturally present in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), to target LSD1. Molecular docking and dynamic simulation approaches revealed that oleacein could target the binding site of the LSD1 cofactor flavin adenosine dinucleotide with high affinity and at low concentrations. At higher concentrations, oleacein was predicted to target the interaction of LSD1 with histone H3 and the LSD1 co-repressor (RCOR1/CoREST), likely disturbing the anchorage of LSD1 to chromatin.

31325197,Delphinidin suppresses breast carcinogenesis through the HOTAIR/microRNA-34a axis.,"Delphinidin, one of the main anthocyanidins, has potent anti-cancer properties. In this study, we investigated the effect of delphinidin on 1-methyl-1-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced breast carcinogenesis on rats and the mechanism of delphinidin via negative regulation of the HOTAIR/microRNA-34a axis. We found administration of delphinidin could effectively suppress MNU-induced mammal breast carcinogenesis. Delphinidin downregulated the level of HOTAIR and upregulated miR-34a in breast carcinogenesis. Western blot analysis confirmed that delphinidin treatment can significantly decrease the expression of β-catenin, glycogen synthase kinase-3β (Gsk3β), c-Myc, cyclin-D1, and matrix metalloproteinase-7(MMP-7) expression in breast cancer cells, and inhibition of miR-34a significantly reduced the effect of delphinidin on c-Myc, cyclin-D1, and MMP-7. HOTAIR overexpression also blocked the effect of delphinidin on miR-34a and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay results showed that delphinidin upregulated miR-34a by inhibiting HOTAIR, coupled with enhancement of the zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and histone H3 Lys27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). This study indicated that delphinidin may potentially suppress breast carcinogenesis and exert its anti-cancer effect through the HOTAIR/miR-34a axis.

METHODS: Chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 1, geminin, and γ-H2A histone family member X expression levels were immunohistochemically examined in tissue specimens from 55 patients with oral epithelial precursor lesions and 50 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma. Associations of clinicopathological variables with marker expression were assessed.
RESULTS: Chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 1 was expressed in the prickle cell layer of oral epithelial precursor lesions and many carcinoma cells of oral squamous cell carcinoma. Geminin reactivity was widely distributed in high-grade dysplasia and oral squamous cell carcinoma rather than low-grade or no dysplastic cases. γ-H2A histone family member X was expressed in the superficial layer of oral epithelial precursor lesions and scattered carcinoma cells of oral squamous cell carcinoma.

31317161,Quantification of DNA damage induced repair focus formation via super-resolution dSTORM localization microscopy.,"In eukaryotic cells, each process, in which DNA is involved, should take place in the context of a chromatin structure. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are one of the most deleterious lesions often leading to chromosomal rearrangement. In response to environmental stresses, cells have developed repair mechanisms to eliminate the DSBs. Upon DSB induction, several factors play roles in chromatin relaxation by catalysing the appropriate histone posttranslational modification (PTM) steps, therefore promoting the access of the repair factors to the DSBs. Among these PTMs, the phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX at its Ser139 residue (also known as γH2AX) could be observed at the break sites. The structure of a DNA double-strand break induced repair focus has to be organized during the repair as it contributes to the accessibility of specific repair proteins to the damaged site. Our aim was to develop a quantitative approach to analyse the morphology of single repair foci by super-resolution dSTORM microscopy to gain insight into chromatin organization in DNA repair. We have established a specific dSTORM measurement process by developing a new analytical algorithm for gaining quantitative information about chromatin morphology and repair foci topology at an individual γH2AX enriched repair focus. Using this method we quantified single repair foci to show the distribution of γH2AX. The image of individual γH2AX referred to as the Single target Molecule response scatter Plot (SMPlot) was obtained by using high lateral resolution dSTORM images. Determination of the average localization numbers in an SMPlot was one of the key steps of quantitative dSTORM. A repair focus is made up of nanofoci. Such a substructure of repair foci can only be resolved and detected with super-resolution microscopy. Determination of the number of γH2AXs in the nanofoci was another key step of quantitative dSTORM. Additionally, based on our new analysis method, we were able to show the number of nucleosomes in each nanofocus that could allow us to define the possible chromatin structure and the nucleosome density around the break sites. This method is one of the first demonstrations of a single-cell based quantitative measurement of a discrete repair focus, which could provide new opportunities to categorize the spatial organization of nanofoci by parametric determination of topological similarity.",Nanoscale,2019,"['Varga D', 'Majoros H', 'Ujfaludi Z', 'Erdélyi M', 'Pankotai T']"

This study explored the acetyltransferase activity of p300 on JHDM1A and analyzed the JHDM1A acetylation on H3K36me2 demethylation in osteosarcoma. Co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) and immunoblotting assay found that p300 directly acetylated JHDM1A at K409 residue in osteosarcoma MG-63 and HOS cells. Nucleosomes and mononucleosomes were prepared and found that acetylation of JHDMIA disrupted its association with nucleosomes and thereby impaired its capability to induce H3K36me2 demethylation.

31304633,Conserved crosstalk between histone deacetylation and H3K79 methylation generates DOT1L-dose dependency in HDAC1-deficient thymic lymphoma.,"DOT1L methylates histone H3K79 and is aberrantly regulated in MLL-rearranged leukemia. Inhibitors have been developed to target DOT1L activity in leukemia, but cellular mechanisms that regulate DOT1L are still poorly understood. We have identified the histone deacetylase Rpd3 as a negative regulator of budding yeast Dot1. At its target genes, the transcriptional repressor Rpd3 restricts H3K79 methylation, explaining the absence of H3K79me3 at a subset of genes in the yeast genome. Similar to the crosstalk in yeast, inactivation of the murine Rpd3 homolog HDAC1 in thymocytes led to an increase in H3K79 methylation. Thymic lymphomas that arise upon genetic deletion of Hdac1 retained the increased H3K79 methylation and were sensitive to reduced DOT1L dosage. Furthermore, cell lines derived from Hdac1",EMBO J.,2019,"['Vlaming H', 'McLean CM', 'Korthout T', 'Alemdehy MF', 'Hendriks S', 'Lancini C', 'Palit S', 'Klarenbeek S', 'Kwesi-Maliepaard EM', 'Molenaar TM', 'Hoekman L', 'Schmidlin TT', 'Altelaar AM', 'van Welsem T', 'Dannenberg JH', 'Jacobs H', 'van Leeuwen F']"
31301043,Genetic Factors Affecting Sperm Chromatin Structure.,"Spermatozoa genome has unique features that make it a fascinating field of investigation: first, because, with oocyte genome, it can be transmitted generation after generation; second, because of genetic shuffling during meiosis, each spermatozoon is virtually unique in terms of genetic content, with consequences for species evolution; and finally, because its chromatin organization is very different from that of somatic cells or oocytes, as it is not based on nucleosomes but on nucleoprotamines which confer a higher order of packaging. Histone-to-protamine transition involves many actors, such as regulators of spermatid gene expression, components of the nuclear envelop, histone-modifying enzymes and readers, chaperones, histone variants, transition proteins, protamines, and certainly many more to be discovered.In this book chapter, we will present what is currently known about sperm chromatin structure and how it is established during spermiogenesis, with the aim to list the genetic factors that regulate its organization.",Adv.

31299901,Genome-wide mapping and profiling of γH2AX binding hotspots in response to different replication stress inducers.,"BACKGROUND: Replication stress (RS) gives rise to DNA damage that threatens genome stability. RS can originate from different sources that stall replication by diverse mechanisms. However, the mechanism underlying how different types of RS contribute to genome instability is unclear, in part due to the poor understanding of the distribution and characteristics of damage sites induced by different RS mechanisms.
RESULTS: We use ChIP-seq to map γH2AX binding sites genome-wide caused by aphidicolin (APH), hydroxyurea (HU), and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) treatments in human lymphocyte cells. Mapping of γH2AX ChIP-seq reveals that APH, HU, and MMS treatments induce non-random γH2AX chromatin binding at discrete regions, suggesting that there are γH2AX binding hotspots in the genome. Characterization of the distribution and sequence/epigenetic features of γH2AX binding sites reveals that the three treatments induce γH2AX binding at largely non-overlapping regions, suggesting that RS may cause damage at specific genomic loci in a manner dependent on the fork stalling mechanism. Nonetheless, γH2AX binding sites induced by the three treatments share common features including compact chromatin, coinciding with larger-than-average genes, and depletion of CpG islands and transcription start sites. Moreover, we observe significant enrichment of SINEs in γH2AX sites in all treatments, indicating that SINEs may be a common barrier for replication polymerases.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results identify the location and common features of genome instability hotspots induced by different types of RS, and help in deciphering the mechanisms underlying RS-induced genetic diseases and carcinogenesis.",BMC Genomics,2019,"['Lyu X', 'Chastain M', 'Chai W']"
31294776,Human Trophoblast Differentiation Is Associated With Profound Gene Regulatory and Epigenetic Changes.,"Defective placental implantation and vascularization with accompanying hypoxia contribute to preeclampsia (PE), a leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying differentiation of proliferative cytotrophoblasts (CytTs) to multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast (SynT) are incompletely defined. The SynT performs key functions in nutrient and gas exchange, hormone production, and protection of the fetus from rejection by the maternal immune system. In this study, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing of midgestation human trophoblasts before CytT and after SynT differentiation in primary culture to analyze changes in binding of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and of active and repressive histone marks during SynT differentiation. Our findings reveal that increased Pol II binding to promoters of a subset of genes during trophoblast differentiation was closely correlated with active histone marks. This gene set was enriched in those controlling immune response and immune modulation, including interferon-induced tetratricopeptide repeat and placenta-specific glycoprotein gene family members. By contrast, genes downregulated during SynT differentiation included proinflammatory transcription factors ERG1, cFOS, and cJUN, as well as members of the NR4A orphan nuclear receptor subfamily, NUR77, NURR1, and NOR1. Downregulation of proinflammatory transcription factors upon SynT differentiation was associated with decreased promoter enrichment of endogenous H3K27Ac and H3K9Ac and enhanced binding of H3K9me3 and histone deacetylase 1. However, promoter enrichment of H3K27me3 was low in both CytT and SynT and was not altered with changes in gene expression. These findings provide important insight into mechanisms underlying human trophoblast differentiation and may identify therapeutic targets for placental disorders, such as PE.",Endocrinology,2019,"['Kwak YT', 'Muralimanoharan S', 'Gogate AA', 'Mendelson CR']"
31287868,Super-resolution microscopy reveals how histone tail acetylation affects DNA compaction within nucleosomes in vivo.,"Chromatin organization is crucial for regulating gene expression. Previously, we showed that nucleosomes form groups, termed clutches. Clutch size correlated with the pluripotency grade of mouse embryonic stem cells and human induced pluripotent stem cells. Recently, it was also shown that regions of the chromatin containing activating epigenetic marks were composed of small and dispersed chromatin nanodomains with lower DNA density compared to the larger silenced domains. Overall, these results suggest that clutch size may regulate DNA packing density and gene activity. To directly test this model, we carried out 3D, two-color super-resolution microscopy of histones and DNA with and without increased histone tail acetylation. Our results showed that lower percentage of DNA was associated with nucleosome clutches in hyperacetylated cells. We further showed that the radius and compaction level of clutch-associated DNA decreased in hyperacetylated cells, especially in regions containing several neighboring clutches. Importantly, this change was independent of clutch size but dependent on the acetylation state of the clutch. Our results directly link the epigenetic state of nucleosome clutches to their DNA packing density. Our results further provide in vivo support to previous in vitro models that showed a disruption of nucleosome-DNA interactions upon hyperacetylation.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2019,"['Otterstrom J', 'Castells-Garcia A', 'Vicario C', 'Gomez-Garcia PA', 'Cosma MP', 'Lakadamyali M']"
31278053,HAT1 Coordinates Histone Production and Acetylation via H4 Promoter Binding.,"The energetic costs of duplicating chromatin are large and therefore likely depend on nutrient sensing checkpoints and metabolic inputs. By studying chromatin modifiers regulated by epithelial growth factor, we identified histone acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1) as an induced gene that enhances proliferation through coordinating histone production, acetylation, and glucose metabolism. In addition to its canonical role as a cytoplasmic histone H4 acetyltransferase, we isolated a HAT1-containing complex bound specifically at promoters of H4 genes. HAT1-dependent transcription of H4 genes required an acetate-sensitive promoter element. HAT1 expression was critical for S-phase progression and maintenance of H3 lysine 9 acetylation at proliferation-associated genes, including histone genes. Therefore, these data describe a feedforward circuit whereby HAT1 captures acetyl groups on nascent histones and drives H4 production by chromatin binding to support chromatin replication and acetylation. These findings have important implications for human disease, since high HAT1 levels associate with poor outcomes across multiple cancer types.",Mol.

31276581,Cockayne syndrome group B deficiency reduces H3K9me3 chromatin remodeler SETDB1 and exacerbates cellular aging.,"Cockayne syndrome is an accelerated aging disorder, caused by mutations in the CSA or CSB genes. In CSB-deficient cells, poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) is persistently activated by unrepaired DNA damage and consumes and depletes cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, which leads to mitochondrial dysfunction. Here, the distribution of poly (ADP ribose) (PAR) was determined in CSB-deficient cells using ADPr-ChAP (ADP ribose-chromatin affinity purification), and the results show striking enrichment of PAR at transcription start sites, depletion of heterochromatin and downregulation of H3K9me3-specific methyltransferases SUV39H1 and SETDB1. Induced-expression of SETDB1 in CSB-deficient cells downregulated PAR and normalized mitochondrial function. The results suggest that defects in CSB are strongly associated with loss of heterochromatin, downregulation of SETDB1, increased PAR in highly-transcribed regions, and mitochondrial dysfunction.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2019,"['Lee JH', 'Demarest TG', 'Babbar M', 'Kim EW', 'Okur MN', 'De S', 'Croteau DL', 'Bohr VA']"
31266464,NUCLIZE for quantifying epigenome: generating histone modification data at single-nucleosome resolution using genuine nucleosome positions.,"BACKGROUND: Defining histone modification at single-nucleosome resolution provides accurate epigenomic information in individual nucleosomes. However, most of histone modification data deposited in current databases, such as ENCODE and Roadmap, have low resolution with peaks of several kilo-base pairs (kb), which due to the technical defects of regular ChIP-Seq technology.
RESULTS: To generate histone modification data at single-nucleosome resolution, we developed a novel approach, NUCLIZE, using synergistic analyses of histone modification data from ChIP-Seq and high-resolution nucleosome mapping data from native MNase-Seq. With this approach, we generated quantitative epigenomics data of single and multivalent histone modification marks in each nucleosome. We found that the dominant trivalent histone mark (H3K4me3/H3K9ac/H3K27ac) and others showed defined and specific patterns near each TSS, indicating potential epigenetic codes regulating gene transcription.
CONCLUSIONS: Single-nucleosome histone modification data render epigenomic data become quantitative, which is essential for investigating dynamic changes of epigenetic regulation in the biological process or for functional epigenomics studies. Thus, NUCLIZE turns current epigenomic mapping studies into genuine functional epigenomics studies with quantitative epigenomic data.",BMC Genomics,2019,"['Zheng D', 'Trynda J', 'Sun Z', 'Li Z']"
31266244,Nuclear Organization in Stress and Aging.,"The eukaryotic nucleus controls most cellular processes. It is isolated from the cytoplasm by the nuclear envelope, which plays a prominent role in the structural organization of the cell, including nucleocytoplasmic communication, chromatin positioning, and gene expression. Alterations in nuclear composition and function are eminently pronounced upon stress and during premature and physiological aging. These alterations are often accompanied by epigenetic changes in histone modifications. We review, here, the role of nuclear envelope proteins and histone modifiers in the 3-dimensional organization of the genome and the implications for gene expression. In particular, we focus on the nuclear lamins and the chromatin-associated protein BAF, which are linked to Hutchinson-Gilford and Nestor-Guillermo progeria syndromes, respectively.

31255721,Elevated cyclic-AMP represses expression of exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC1) by inhibiting YAP-TEAD activity and HDAC-mediated histone deacetylation.,"Ligand-induced activation of Exchange Protein Activated by cAMP-1 (EPAC1) is implicated in numerous physiological and pathological processes, including cardiac fibrosis where changes in EPAC1 expression have been detected. However, little is known about how EPAC1 expression is regulated. Therefore, we investigated regulation of EPAC1 expression by cAMP in cardiac fibroblasts. Elevation of cAMP using forskolin, cAMP-analogues or adenosine A2B-receptor activation significantly reduced EPAC1 mRNA and protein levels and inhibited formation of F-actin stress fibres. Inhibition of actin polymerisation with cytochalasin-D, latrunculin-B or the ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632, mimicked effects of cAMP on EPAC1 mRNA and protein levels. Elevated cAMP also inhibited activity of an EPAC1 promoter-reporter gene, which contained a consensus binding element for TEAD, which is a target for inhibition by cAMP. Inhibition of TEAD activity using siRNA-silencing of its co-factors YAP and TAZ, expression of dominant-negative TEAD or treatment with YAP-TEAD inhibitors, significantly inhibited EPAC1 expression. However, whereas expression of constitutively-active YAP completely reversed forskolin inhibition of EPAC1-promoter activity it did not rescue EPAC1 mRNA levels. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation detected a significant reduction in histone3-lysine27-acetylation at the EPAC1 proximal promoter in response to forskolin stimulation. HDAC1/3 inhibition partially reversed forskolin inhibition of EPAC1 expression, which was completely rescued by simultaneously expressing constitutively active YAP. Taken together, these data demonstrate that cAMP downregulates EPAC1 gene expression via disrupting the actin cytoskeleton, which inhibits YAP/TAZ-TEAD activity in concert with HDAC-mediated histone deacetylation at the EPAC1 proximal promoter. This represents a novel negative feedback mechanism controlling EPAC1 levels in response to cAMP elevation.",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Res,2019,"['Ebrahimighaei R', 'McNeill MC', 'Smith SA', 'Wray JP', 'Ford KL', 'Newby AC', 'Bond M']"
31247956,Epigenetic Mechanisms in Hirschsprung Disease.,"Hirschsprung disease (HSCR, OMIM 142623) is due to a failure of enteric precursor cells derived from neural crest (EPCs) to proliferate, migrate, survive or differentiate during Enteric Nervous System (ENS) formation. This is a complex process which requires a strict regulation that results in an ENS specific gene expression pattern. Alterations at this level lead to the onset of neurocristopathies such as HSCR. Gene expression is regulated by different mechanisms, such as DNA modifications (at the epigenetic level), transcriptional mechanisms (transcription factors, silencers, enhancers and repressors), postranscriptional mechanisms (3'UTR and ncRNA) and regulation of translation. All these mechanisms are finally implicated in cell signaling to determine the migration, proliferation, differentiation and survival processes for correct ENS development.

Several general features including the presence of specific histone modifications are used to demarcate potentially active enhancers. Here we reveal that putative enhancers marked with H3 lysine 79 (H3K79) di or trimethylation (me2/3) (which we name H3K79me2/3 enhancer elements or KEEs) can be found in multiple cell types. Mixed lineage leukemia gene (MLL) rearrangements (MLL-r) such as MLL-AF4 are a major cause of incurable acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL). Using the DOT1L inhibitor EPZ-5676 in MLL-AF4 leukemia cells, we show that H3K79me2/3 is required for maintaining chromatin accessibility, histone acetylation and transcription factor binding specifically at KEEs but not non-KEE enhancers. We go on to show that H3K79me2/3 is essential for maintaining enhancer-promoter interactions at a subset of KEEs.

31226208,SIRT7 mediates L1 elements transcriptional repression and their association with the nuclear lamina.,"Long interspersed elements-1 (LINE-1, L1) are retrotransposons that hold the capacity of self-propagation in the genome with potential mutagenic outcomes. How somatic cells restrict L1 activity and how this process becomes dysfunctional during aging and in cancer cells is poorly understood. L1s are enriched at lamin-associated domains, heterochromatic regions of the nuclear periphery. Whether this association is necessary for their repression has been elusive. Here we show that the sirtuin family member SIRT7 participates in the epigenetic transcriptional repression of L1 genome-wide in both mouse and human cells. SIRT7 depletion leads to increased L1 expression and retrotransposition. Mechanistically, we identify a novel interplay between SIRT7 and Lamin A/C in L1 repression. Our results demonstrate that SIRT7-mediated H3K18 deacetylation regulates L1 expression and promotes L1 association with elements of the nuclear lamina. The failure of such activity might contribute to the observed genome instability and compromised viability in SIRT7 knockout mice. Overall, our results reveal a novel function of SIRT7 on chromatin organization by mediating the anchoring of L1 to the nuclear envelope, and a new functional link of the nuclear lamina with transcriptional repression.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2019,"['Vazquez BN', 'Thackray JK', 'Simonet NG', 'Chahar S', 'Kane-Goldsmith N', 'Newkirk SJ', 'Lee S', 'Xing J', 'Verzi MP', 'An W', 'Vaquero A', 'Tischfield JA', 'Serrano L']"

For example, histone H3.3 and H2A.Z are both involved in gene expression regulation, whereas H2A.X is a specific variant that responds to DNA double-strand breaks. In this study, we characterized H4G, a novel hominidae-specific histone H4 variant. We found that H4G is expressed in a variety of human cell lines and exhibit tumor-stage dependent overexpression in tissues from breast cancer patients. We found that H4G localized primarily to the nucleoli of the cell nucleus. This localization was controlled by the interaction of the alpha-helix 3 of the histone fold motif with a histone chaperone, nucleophosmin 1. In addition, we found that modulating H4G expression affects rRNA expression levels, protein synthesis rates and cell-cycle progression.

The close relationship between genetic and environmental factors suggests that eating habits and unhealthy lifestyles may significantly affect metabolic pathways, resulting in dynamic modifications of chromatin-associated proteins and homeostatic transcriptional responses involved in the progression of T2DM. Epigenetic mechanisms may be implicated in the complex processes linking environmental factors to genetic predisposition to metabolic disturbances, leading to obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Endothelial dysfunction represents an earlier marker and an important player in the development of this disease. Dysregulation of the endothelial ability to produce and release vasoactive mediators is recognized as the initial feature of impaired vascular activity under obesity and other insulin resistance conditions and undoubtedly concurs to the accelerated progression of atherosclerotic lesions and overall cardiovascular risk in T2DM patients.

Here, we purify Mediator from neural stem cells (NSCs) and identify 75 protein-protein interaction partners. We identify super enhancers in NSCs and show that Mediator-interacting chromatin modifiers colocalize with Mediator at enhancers and super enhancers. Transcription factor families with high affinity for Mediator dominate enhancers and super enhancers and can explain genome-wide Mediator localization. We identify E-box transcription factor Tcf4 as a key regulator of NSCs. Tcf4 interacts with Mediator, colocalizes with Mediator at super enhancers and regulates neurogenic transcription factor genes with super enhancers and broad H3K4me3 domains.

The limitations of currently available technologies, such as growth factors and/or gene therapies has led to the search of alternatives. We explore here how a cell's epigenome influences determination of cell type, and potential applications in tissue engineering. A prevalent epigenetic modification is the acetylation of DNA core histone proteins. Acetylation levels heavily influence gene transcription. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes can remove these acetyl groups, leading to the formation of a condensed and more transcriptionally silenced chromatin. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) can inhibit these enzymes, resulting in the increased acetylation of histones, thereby affecting gene expression. There is strong evidence to suggest that HDACis can be utilised in stem cell therapies and tissue engineering, potentially providing novel tools to control stem cell fate. This review introduces the structure/function of HDAC enzymes and their links to different tissue types (specifically bone, cardiac, neural tissues), including the history, current status and future perspectives of using HDACis for stem cell research and tissue engineering, with particular attention paid to how different HDAC isoforms may be integral to this field.",Int J Oral Sci,2019,"['Lawlor L', 'Yang XB']"

31198932,Phosphorylation of repressive histone code readers by casein kinase 2 plays diverse roles in heterochromatin regulation.,"Heterochromatin is a condensed and transcriptionally silent chromatin structure and that plays important roles in epigenetic regulation of the genome. Two types of heterochromatin exist: constitutive heterochromatin is primarily associated with trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me3), and facultative heterochromatin with trimethylation of H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3). The methylated histones are bound by the chromodomain of histone code 'reader' proteins: HP1 family proteins for H3K9me3 and Polycomb family proteins for H3K27me3. Each repressive reader associates with various 'effector' proteins that provide the functional basis of heterochromatin. Heterochromatin regulation is primarily achieved by controlling histone modifications. However, recent studies have revealed that the repressive readers are phosphorylated, like other regulatory proteins, suggesting that phosphorylation also participates in heterochromatin regulation. Detailed studies have shown that phosphorylation of readers affects the binding specificities of chromodomains for methylated histone H3, as well as the binding of effector proteins. Thus, phosphorylation adds another layer to heterochromatin regulation. Interestingly, casein kinase 2, a strong and predominant kinase within the cell, is responsible for phosphorylation of repressive readers. In this commentary, I summarize the regulation of repressive readers by casein kinase 2-dependent phosphorylation and discuss the functional meaning of this modification.",J.

METHODS: Proscillaridin A anticancer activity was investigated against a panel of human leukemia and solid tumor cell lines with different MYC expression levels, overexpression in vitro systems and leukemia stem cells. RNA-sequencing and differentiation studies were used to characterize transcriptional and phenotypic changes. Drug-induced epigenetic changes were studied by chromatin post-translational modification analysis, expression of chromatin regulators, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and mass-spectrometry.
RESULTS: At a clinically relevant dose, proscillaridin A rapidly altered MYC protein half-life causing MYC degradation and growth inhibition. Transcriptomic profile of leukemic cells after treatment showed a downregulation of genes involved in MYC pathways, cell replication and an upregulation of hematopoietic differentiation genes. Functional studies confirmed cell cycle inhibition and the onset of leukemia differentiation even after drug removal. Proscillaridin A induced a significant loss of lysine acetylation in histone H3 (at lysine 9, 14, 18 and 27) and in non-histone proteins such as MYC itself, MYC target proteins, and a series of histone acetylation regulators. Global loss of acetylation correlated with the rapid downregulation of histone acetyltransferases. Importantly, proscillaridin A demonstrated anticancer activity against lymphoid and myeloid stem cell populations characterized by MYC overexpression.

This work linked Ras with H1.4 modification in non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), to better understand the oncogenic effects of Ras. A plasmid for expressing Ras mutated at G13D and T35S was transfected into NCI-H2126 and A549 cells. Phosphorylation of H1.4S36 was determined by immunoblotting. Effects of phosphorylation of H1.4 at serine (S) 36 (H1.4S36ph) on NCI-H2126 and A549 cells were tested by MTT assay, soft-agar colony formation assay, flow cytometry and transwell assay. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and RT-qPCR were conducted to measure the effects of H1.4S36ph on Ras downstream genes. The catalyzing enzymes participate in H1.4S36 phosphorylation were further studied. We found that Ras-ERK signalling repressed the phosphorylation of H1.4 at S36. H1.4S36ph functioned as a tumour suppressor, as its overexpression repressed NCI-H2126 and A549 cells viability, colony formation, S-phase arrest, migration and invasion. H1.4S36ph was able to mediate the transcription of Ras downstream genes. Ras-ERK signalling repressed H1.4S36ph through degradation of PKA, and the degradation was mediated by MDM2. In conclusion, Ras-ERK signalling repressed H1.4 phosphorylation at S36 to participate in NSCLC cells growth, migration and invasion. Ras-ERK signalling repressed H1.4S36ph through MDM2-dependent degradation of PKA. This study provides a novel explanation for Ras-ERK's tumour-promoting function. Highlights: H1.4S36 phosphorylation is repressed by Ras-ERK activation; H1.4S36ph inhibits the phenotype of NSCLC cells; H1.4S36ph regulates the transcription of Ras downstream genes; Ras-ERK represses H1.4S36ph by MDM2-dependent degradation of PKA.",Artif Cells Nanomed Biotechnol,2019,"['Shi S', 'Zhang J', 'Liu M', 'Dong H', 'Li N']"
31180045,Cell-free chromatin: A newly described mediator of systemic inflammation.,"Recent research has shown that cell-free chromatin (cfCh) particles that are released from the billions of cells that die in the body everyday can enter into healthy cells, integrate into their genomes and induce dsDNA breaks and apoptotic responses. Genomic integration of cfCh activates NF κ B suggesting a novel mechanism of induction of systemic inflammation.

31167352,The High Mobility Group A1 (HMGA1) Chromatin Architectural Factor Modulates Nuclear Stiffness in Breast Cancer Cells.,"Plasticity is an essential condition for cancer cells to invade surrounding tissues. The nucleus is the most rigid cellular organelle and it undergoes substantial deformations to get through environmental constrictions. Nuclear stiffness mostly depends on the nuclear lamina and chromatin, which in turn might be affected by nuclear architectural proteins. Among these is the HMGA1 (High Mobility Group A1) protein, a factor that plays a causal role in neoplastic transformation and that is able to disentangle heterochromatic domains by H1 displacement. Here we made use of atomic force microscopy to analyze the stiffness of breast cancer cellular models in which we modulated HMGA1 expression to investigate its role in regulating nuclear plasticity. Since histone H1 is the main modulator of chromatin structure and HMGA1 is a well-established histone H1 competitor, we correlated HMGA1 expression and cellular stiffness with histone H1 expression level, post-translational modifications, and nuclear distribution. Our results showed that HMGA1 expression level correlates with nuclear stiffness, is associated to histone H1 phosphorylation status, and alters both histone H1 chromatin distribution and expression. These data suggest that HMGA1 might promote chromatin relaxation through a histone H1-mediated mechanism strongly impacting on the invasiveness of cancer cells.",Int J Mol Sci,2019,"['Senigagliesi B', 'Penzo C', 'Severino LU', 'Maraspini R', 'Petrosino S', 'Morales-Navarrete H', 'Pobega E', 'Ambrosetti E', 'Parisse P', 'Pegoraro S', 'Manfioletti G', 'Casalis L', 'Sgarra R']"
31152896,Role of MLL in the modification of H3K4me3 in aluminium-induced cognitive dysfunction.,"It is widely accepted that aluminium is neurotoxic; it primarily causes cognitive dysfunction, which has been confirmed in human and animal tissue and cell experiments (Bondy, 2010), but its toxic mechanism has yet to be fully elucidated. Epigenetics is the study of changes in gene expression that may be triggered by both genetic and environmental factors and is independent from changes in the underlying DNA sequence, resulting in a change in phenotype without a change in genotype, which in turn affects how cells read genes. Some findings emphasize the potential significance of histone lysine methylation for orderly brain development and as a molecular toolbox to study chromatin function in vivo and in vitro. The H3K4-specific methyltransferase MLL is essential for hippocampal synaptic plasticity and might be involved in cognitive dysfunction. In the present study, we established that chronic aluminium exposure results in cognitive dysfunction, causing deficits in exploratory behaviour and learning and memory, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrated in vivo and in vitro that chronic aluminium exposure reduces expression of histone H3K4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) and the activity and expression of MLL. Taken together, these results indicate that chronic aluminium exposure may reduce H3K4me3 levels through suppressing activation of MLL, which in turn affects cognitive ability.",Chemosphere,2019,"['Wang F', 'Kang P', 'Li Z', 'Niu Q']"
31152164,High-throughput single-cell ChIP-seq identifies heterogeneity of chromatin states in breast cancer.,"Modulation of chromatin structure via histone modification is a major epigenetic mechanism and regulator of gene expression. However, the contribution of chromatin features to tumor heterogeneity and evolution remains unknown. Here we describe a high-throughput droplet microfluidics platform to profile chromatin landscapes of thousands of cells at single-cell resolution. Using patient-derived xenograft models of acquired resistance to chemotherapy and targeted therapy in breast cancer, we found that a subset of cells within untreated drug-sensitive tumors share a common chromatin signature with resistant cells, undetectable using bulk approaches. These cells, and cells from the resistant tumors, have lost chromatin marks-H3K27me3, which is associated with stable transcriptional repression-for genes known to promote resistance to treatment. This single-cell chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing approach paves the way to study the role of chromatin heterogeneity, not just in cancer but in other diseases and healthy systems, notably during cellular differentiation and development.",Nat.

31147750,Understanding histone H3 lysine 36 methylation and its deregulation in disease.,"Methylation of histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) plays crucial roles in the partitioning of chromatin to distinctive domains and the regulation of a wide range of biological processes. Trimethylation of H3K36 (H3K36me3) demarcates body regions of the actively transcribed genes, providing signals for modulating transcription fidelity, mRNA splicing and DNA damage repair; and di-methylation of H3K36 (H3K36me2) spreads out within large intragenic regions, regulating distribution of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and possibly DNA methylation. These H3K36 methylation-mediated events are biologically crucial and controlled by different classes of proteins responsible for either 'writing', 'reading' or 'erasing' of H3K36 methylation marks. Deregulation of H3K36 methylation and related regulatory factors leads to pathogenesis of disease such as developmental syndrome and cancer. Additionally, recurrent mutations of H3K36 and surrounding histone residues are detected in human tumors, further highlighting the importance of H3K36 in biology and medicine. This review will elaborate on current advances in understanding H3K36 methylation and related molecular players during various chromatin-templated cellular processes, their crosstalks with other chromatin factors, as well as their deregulations in the diseased contexts.",Cell.

31142837,DNA damage detection in nucleosomes involves DNA register shifting.,"Access to DNA packaged in nucleosomes is critical for gene regulation, DNA replication and DNA repair. In humans, the UV-damaged DNA-binding protein (UV-DDB) complex detects UV-light-induced pyrimidine dimers throughout the genome; however, it remains unknown how these lesions are recognized in chromatin, in which nucleosomes restrict access to DNA. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of UV-DDB bound to nucleosomes bearing a 6-4 pyrimidine-pyrimidone dimer or a DNA-damage mimic in various positions. We find that UV-DDB binds UV-damaged nucleosomes at lesions located in the solvent-facing minor groove without affecting the overall nucleosome architecture. In the case of buried lesions that face the histone core, UV-DDB changes the predominant translational register of the nucleosome and selectively binds the lesion in an accessible, exposed position. Our findings explain how UV-DDB detects occluded lesions in strongly positioned nucleosomes, and identify slide-assisted site exposure as a mechanism by which high-affinity DNA-binding proteins can access otherwise occluded sites in nucleosomal DNA.",Nature,2019,"['Matsumoto S', 'Cavadini S', 'Bunker RD', 'Grand RS', 'Potenza A', 'Rabl J', 'Yamamoto J', 'Schenk AD', 'Schübeler D', 'Iwai S', 'Sugasawa K', 'Kurumizaka H', 'Thomä NH']"
31127120,Pax3 cooperates with Ldb1 to direct local chromosome architecture during myogenic lineage specification.,"Chromatin looping allows enhancer-bound regulatory factors to influence transcription. Large domains, referred to as topologically associated domains, participate in genome organization. However, the mechanisms underlining interactions within these domains, which control gene expression, are not fully understood. Here we report that activation of embryonic myogenesis is associated with establishment of long-range chromatin interactions centered on Pax3-bound loci. Using mass spectrometry and genomic studies, we identify the ubiquitously expressed LIM-domain binding protein 1 (Ldb1) as the mediator of looping interactions at a subset of Pax3 binding sites. Ldb1 is recruited to Pax3-bound elements independently of CTCF-Cohesin, and is necessary for efficient deposition of H3K4me1 at these sites and chromatin looping. When Ldb1 is deleted in Pax3-expressing cells in vivo, specification of migratory myogenic progenitors is severely impaired. These results highlight Ldb1 requirement for Pax3 myogenic activity and demonstrate how transcription factors can promote formation of sub-topologically associated domain interactions involved in lineage specification.",Nat Commun,2019,"['Magli A', 'Baik J', 'Pota P', 'Cordero CO', 'Kwak IY', 'Garry DJ', 'Love PE', 'Dynlacht BD', 'Perlingeiro RCR']"
31127101,Selective binding of the PHD6 finger of MLL4 to histone H4K16ac links MLL4 and MOF.,"Histone methyltransferase MLL4 is centrally involved in transcriptional regulation and is often mutated in human diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders. MLL4 contains a catalytic SET domain that mono-methylates histone H3K4 and seven PHD fingers of unclear function. Here, we identify the PHD6 finger of MLL4 (MLL4-PHD6) as a selective reader of the epigenetic modification H4K16ac. The solution NMR structure of MLL4-PHD6 in complex with a H4K16ac peptide along with binding and mutational analyses reveal unique mechanistic features underlying recognition of H4K16ac. Genomic studies show that one third of MLL4 chromatin binding sites overlap with H4K16ac-enriched regions in vivo and that MLL4 occupancy in a set of genomic targets depends on the acetyltransferase activity of MOF, a H4K16ac-specific acetyltransferase. The recognition of H4K16ac is conserved in the PHD7 finger of paralogous MLL3. Together, our findings reveal a previously uncharacterized acetyllysine reader and suggest that selective targeting of H4K16ac by MLL4 provides a direct functional link between MLL4, MOF and H4K16 acetylation.",Nat Commun,2019,"['Zhang Y', 'Jang Y', 'Lee JE', 'Ahn J', 'Xu L', 'Holden MR', 'Cornett EM', 'Krajewski K', 'Klein BJ', 'Wang SP', 'Dou Y', 'Roeder RG', 'Strahl BD', 'Rothbart SB', 'Shi X', 'Ge K', 'Kutateladze TG']"
31125562,Jarid2 enhances the progression of bladder cancer through regulating PTEN/AKT signaling.,"AIMS: Jumonji AT-rich interactive domain 2 (Jarid2) is an interacting component of PRC2 which catalyzes methylation of H3K27 (H3K27me3) and causes the downregulation of PTEN. In the present study, we aimed to explore whether Jarid2 could interact with H3K27me3 to regulate PTEN expression in bladder cancer.
MAIN METHODS: Jarid2 expression in bladder cancer tissues and cells were determined by western blotting and RT-PCR. CCK-8, flow cytometry, transwell chamber and in vivo xenograft assays were performed to assess cell growth, apoptosis, migration and tumorigenesis, respectively. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was used to assess the methylation of PTEN.
KEY FINDINGS: Jarid2 expression was increased in bladder cancer tissues and cells. Downregulation of Jarid2 with shRNA transfection obviously inhibited the proliferation, migration and tumorigenesis of bladder cancer T24 and HT-1376 cells and induced cell apoptosis. Jarid2 downregulation decreased the expression of p-AKT and increased PTEN expression. Besides, Jarid2 down-regulation repressed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), whereas knockdown of PTEN impaired this effect. Moreover, upregulation of Jarid2 increased the combination of PTEN promoter and H3K27me3, and 5-aza-CdR rescued it. Meanwhile, 5-aza-CdR administration abolished Jarid2 roles in the promotion of EMT process and AKT activation, as well as the reduction of PTEN expression.
SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, the present study elaborated that Jarid2 facilitated the progression of bladder cancer through H3K27me3-mediated PTEN downregulation and AKT activation, which might provide a new mechanism for Jarid2 in promoting bladder cancer progression.",Life Sci.,2019,"['Wang X', 'Lyu J', 'Ji A', 'Zhang Q', 'Liao G']"

The aim of this review is to analyze and discuss the newest findings regarding the role of H3K18Ac and acetylation of other histones in carcinogenesis.

31101937,Cellular consequences of arginine methylation.,"Arginine methylation is a ubiquitous post-translational modification. Three predominant types of arginine-guanidino methylation occur in Eukarya: mono (Rme1/MMA), symmetric (Rme2s/SDMA), and asymmetric (Rme2a/ADMA). Arginine methylation frequently occurs at sites of protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions, providing specificity for binding partners and stabilization of important biological interactions in diverse cellular processes. Each methylarginine isoform-catalyzed by members of the protein arginine methyltransferase family, Type I (PRMT1-4,6,8) and Type II (PRMT5,9)-has unique downstream consequences. Methylarginines are found in ordered domains, domains of low complexity, and in intrinsically disordered regions of proteins-the latter two of which are intimately connected with biological liquid-liquid phase separation. This review highlights discoveries illuminating how arginine methylation affects genome integrity, gene transcription, mRNA splicing and mRNP biology, protein translation and stability, and phase separation. As more proteins and processes are found to be regulated by arginine methylation, its importance for understanding cellular physiology will continue to grow.",Cell. Mol.

31099784,[Epigenetic Mechanisms of Peptide-Driven Regulation and Neuroprotective Protein FKBP1b].,"Cortexin is a clinically approved cerebral cortex polypeptide complex in calves. The mechanism of cortexin action is not understood well. Two cortexin derivatives, short peptides EDR and DS with neuroprotective activity, were synthesized. According to the data of molecular modeling, these peptides are able to bind to the histone H1.3 protein. This can affect the conformation of histone H1.3, which leads to a change in the chromatin structure in the loci of some genes, in particular Fkbp1b encoding the FK506-binding protein. Electrophysiological processes associated with the Ca^(2+) exchange are disturbed in the pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus during aging of the brain. The Fkbp1b gene encodes peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, regulating the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum of neurons. The activation of the Fkbp1b gene transcription under treatment with short peptides can promote the synthesis of its protein product and the activation of the Ca^(2+) release from organelles of the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum of neurons, which, in turn, can lead to an increase in the functional activity of neurons.",Mol.

The sites of rRNA gene contact often fall on extended (up to 50 kb) regions containing a chromatin mark, H3K27ac histone, typical for superenhancers, as well as on pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions of chromosomes. We found that the DUX4 genes located in the subtelomeric region of human chromosome 4 are surrounded by regions that are often in contact with the rRNA genes. The 25 kb region of this chromosome, presented in version hg19 of the sequenced human genome, contains several copies of the DUX4 gene.

Here we examine DNA methylation, chromatin marks, and transcriptional alterations to define the relationship between transcriptional modulation and spatial changes in chromatin structure. Using human papillomavirus-related oropharyngeal carcinoma as a model, we show aberrant enrichment of repressive H3K9me3 at the transcriptional start site (TSS) with methylation-associated, tumor-specific gene silencing. Further analysis identifies a hypermethylated subtype which shows a functional convergence on MYC targets and association with CREBBP/EP300 mutation. The tumor-specific shift to transcriptional repression associated with DNA methylation at TSSs was confirmed in multiple tumor types.

31087305,Functional Analysis of HDACs in Tumorigenesis.,"HDACs, originally described as histone modifiers, have recently been demonstrated to modify a variety of other proteins that are involved in diverse cellular processes unrelated to the chromatin environment. This includes deacetylation of nonhistone targets involved in multiple signaling pathways. In this regard, a considerable number of reports have analyzed the role of nonspecific inhibition of HDACs through pan-HDACi in cancer as well as processes of immune regulation. However, with pan-HDACi there is a lack of understanding about the exact contribution of inhibition of each individual HDAC, which makes the rational design of improved drug candidates extremely difficult. Additionally, current approaches using nonselective HDACi in the clinic have critical limitations, including pan-HDACi which elicit poor activity in solid tumors and cardiac toxicity, class I HDACi which activate multiple apoptotic pathways, limiting its use for longer periods of time, and class I-HDAC6i that evidenced a number of adverse effects in initial clinical trials. Therefore, there is a growing interest in the identification of more selective HDACi, and the subsequent development of accurate functional tests to identify the effectiveness and selectivity of these inhibitors. In this chapter, we are describing some selected methodologies to identify the individual activities of HDACs.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments have enabled the identification of specific histone modifications and the genes most closely associated with active memory formation. Problematically, however, the majority of these studies analyze diverse populations of cell homogenates obtained from the gross dissection of large brain regions. The protocol outlined here uses methods to ascribe gene-specific histone modifications (via specific antibodies and RT-qPCR) to specific cell subtypes (via specific antibodies and cell sorting) in discrete memory-related brain regions (via microdissection) to more precisely identify the role of histone acetylation and deacetylation in cognitive neuroepigenetics.",Methods Mol.

FA is caused by mutation of any 1 of 22 genes, and the FA proteins function cooperatively to repair DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs). A central step in the activation of the FA pathway is the monoubiquitination of the FANCD2 and FANCI proteins, which occurs within chromatin. How FANCD2 and FANCI are anchored to chromatin remains unknown. In this study, we identify and characterize a FANCD2 histone-binding domain (HBD) and embedded methyl-lysine-binding domain (MBD) and demonstrate binding specificity for H4K20me2. Disruption of the HBD/MBD compromises FANCD2 chromatin binding and nuclear focus formation and its ability to promote error-free DNA interstrand cross-link repair, leading to increased error-prone repair and genome instability.

31085275,The dynamics and regulation of chromatin remodeling during spermiogenesis.,"The functional sperm is the key factor for species continuation. The process spermatogenesis, to produce mature sperm is quite complex. It begins with the proliferation and differentiation of spermatogonia, which develop from primary spermatocytes to secondary spermatocytes and round spermatids, which eventually develop into fertile mature sperm. Spermiogenesis is the latest stage of spermatogenesis, where the round spermatids undergo a series of dramatic morphological changes and extreme condensation of chromatin to construct mature sperm with species-specific shape. During spermiogenesis, chromatin remodeling is a unique progress. It leads the nucleosome from a histone-based structure to a mostly protamine-based configuration. The main events of chromatin remodeling are the replacement of histone by histone variants, hyperacetylation, transient DNA strand breaks and repair, variants by transition proteins and finally by protamines. In this review, we synthesize and summarize the current knowledge on the progress of chromatin remodeling during spermiogenesis.

31075127,RAG2 localization and dynamics in the pre-B cell nucleus.,"RAG2 of the V(D)J recombinase is essential for lymphocyte development. Within the RAG2 noncore region is a plant homeodomain (PHD) that interacts with the modified histone H3K4me3, and this interaction is important for relieving inhibition of the RAG recombinase for V(D)J recombination. However, the effect of the noncore region on RAG2 localization and dynamics in cell nuclei is poorly understood. Here, we used cell imaging to measure the effect of mutating the RAG2 noncore region on properties of the full length protein. We measured GFP-labeled full length RAG2 (FL), the RAG2 core region alone (Core), and a T490A mutant in the noncore region, which has unique regulatory properties. This showed that FL, T490A, and Core localized to nuclear domains that were adjacent to DAPI-rich heterochromatin, and that contained the active chromatin marker H3K4me3. Within the RAG2-enriched regions, T490A exhibited greater colocalization with H3K4me3 than either FL or Core. Furthermore, colocalization of H3K4me3 with FL and T490A, but not Core, increased in conditions that increased H3K4me3 levels. Superresolution imaging showed H3K4me3 was distributed as puncta that RAG2 abutted, and mobility measurements showed that T490A had a significantly lower rate of diffusion within the nucleus than either FL or Core proteins. Finally, mutating Trp453 of the T490A mutant (W453A,T490A), which blocks PHD-dependent interactions with H3K4me3, abolished the T490A-mediated increased colocalization with H3K4me3 and slower mobility compared to FL. Altogether, these data show that Thr490 in the noncore region modulates RAG2 localization and dynamics in the pre-B cell nucleus, such as by affecting RAG2 interactions with H3K4me3.",PLoS ONE,2019,"['Rodgers W', 'Byrum JN', 'Simpson DA', 'Hoolehan W', 'Rodgers KK']"

Here, we identify human C21orf127 (HEMK2, N6AMT1, PrmC), a member of the seven-β-strand family of putative methyltransferases, as a novel histone lysine methyltransferase. C21orf127 functions as an obligate heterodimer with TRMT112, writing the methylation mark on lysine 12 of histone H4 (H4K12) in vitro and in vivo. We characterized H4K12 recognition by solving the crystal structure of human C21orf127-TRMT112, hereafter termed 'lysine methyltransferase 9' (KMT9), in complex with S-adenosyl-homocysteine and H4K12me1 peptide. Additional analyses revealed enrichment for KMT9 and H4K12me1 at the promoters of numerous genes encoding cell cycle regulators and control of cell cycle progression by KMT9. Importantly, KMT9 depletion severely affects the proliferation of androgen receptor-dependent, as well as that of castration- and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells and xenograft tumors.

However, their potential nuclear functions remain poorly understood. Here we find that a fraction of full length Colony Stimulating Factor-1 Receptor (CSF-1R), an RTK involved in monocyte/macrophage generation, migrates to the nucleus upon CSF-1 stimulation in human primary monocytes. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation identifies the preferential recruitment of CSF-1R to intergenic regions, where it co-localizes with H3K4me1 and interacts with the transcription factor EGR1. When monocytes are differentiated into macrophages with CSF-1, CSF-1R is redirected to transcription starting sites, colocalizes with H3K4me3, and interacts with ELK and YY1 transcription factors. CSF-1R expression and chromatin recruitment is modulated by small molecule CSF-1R inhibitors and altered in monocytes from chronic myelomonocytic leukemia patients. Unraveling this dynamic non-canonical CSF-1R function suggests new avenues to explore the poorly understood functions of this receptor and its ligands.",Nat Commun,2019,"['Bencheikh L', 'Diop MK', 'Rivière J', 'Imanci A', 'Pierron G', 'Souquere S', 'Naimo A', 'Morabito M', 'Dussiot M', 'De Leeuw F', 'Lobry C', 'Solary E', 'Droin N']"
31021597,Histone H2A Variants Enhance the Initiation of Base Excision Repair in Nucleosomes.,"Substituting histone variants for their canonical counterparts can profoundly alter chromatin structure, thereby impacting multiple biological processes. Here, we investigate the influence of histone variants from the H2A family on the excision of uracil (U) by the base excision repair (BER) enzymes uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) and single-strand selective monofunctional uracil DNA glycosylase. Using a DNA population with globally distributed U:G base pairs, enhanced excision is observed in H2A.Z and macroH2A-containing nucleosome core particles (NCPs). The U with reduced solution accessibility exhibit limited UDG activity in canonical NCPs but are more readily excised in variant NCPs, reflecting the ability of these variants to facilitate excision at sites that are otherwise poorly repaired. We also find that U with the largest increase in the level of excision in variant NCPs are clustered in regions with differential structural features between the variants and canonical H2A. Within 35-40 bp of the DNA terminus in macroH2A NCPs, the activities of both glycosylases are comparable to that on the free duplex. We show that this high level of activity results from two distinct species within the macroH2A NCP ensemble: octasomes and hexasomes. These observations reveal potential functions for H2A variants in promoting BER and preventing mutagenesis within the context of chromatin.",ACS Chem. Biol.,2019,"['Li C', 'Delaney S']"
31020544,Bookmarking by histone methylation ensures chromosomal integrity during mitosis.,"The cell cycle is an orchestrated process that replicates DNA and transmits genetic information to daughter cells. Cell cycle progression is governed by diverse histone modifications that control gene transcription in a timely fashion. Histone modifications also regulate cell cycle progression by marking specific chromatic regions. While many reviews have covered histone phosphorylation and acetylation as regulators of the cell cycle, little attention has been paid to the roles of histone methylation in the faithful progression of mitosis. Indeed, specific histone methylations occurring before, during, or after mitosis affect kinetochore assembly and chromosome condensation and segregation. In addition to timing, histone methylations specify the chromatin regions such as chromosome arms, pericentromere, and centromere. Therefore, spatiotemporal programming of histone methylations ensures epigenetic inheritance through mitosis. This review mainly discusses histone methylations and their relevance to mitotic progression.",Arch. Pharm. Res.,2019,['Kim JE']
31015495,A DNMT3A PWWP mutation leads to methylation of bivalent chromatin and growth retardation in mice.,"DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) deposit DNA methylation, which regulates gene expression and is essential for mammalian development. Histone post-translational modifications modulate the recruitment and activity of DNMTs. The PWWP domains of DNMT3A and DNMT3B are posited to interact with histone 3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3); however, the functionality of this interaction for DNMT3A remains untested in vivo. Here we present a mouse model carrying a D329A point mutation in the DNMT3A PWWP domain. The mutation causes dominant postnatal growth retardation. At the molecular level, it results in progressive DNA hypermethylation across domains marked by H3K27me3 and bivalent chromatin, and de-repression of developmental regulatory genes in adult hypothalamus. Evaluation of non-CpG methylation, a marker of de novo methylation, further demonstrates the altered recruitment and activity of DNMT3A",Nat Commun,2019,"['Sendžikaitė G', 'Hanna CW', 'Stewart-Morgan KR', 'Ivanova E', 'Kelsey G']"
31015444,The H2A.Z histone variant integrates Wnt signaling in intestinal epithelial homeostasis.,"The Tip60/p400 chromatin-modifying complex, which is involved in the incorporation and post-translational modification of the H2A.Z histone variant, regulates cell proliferation and important signaling pathways, such as Wnt. Here, we study the involvement of H2A.Z in intestinal epithelial homeostasis, which is dependent on the finely-tuned equilibrium between stem cells renewal and differentiation, under the control of such pathway. We use cell models and inducible knock-out mice to study the impact of H2A.Z depletion on intestinal homeostasis. We show that H2A.Z is essential for the proliferation of human cancer and normal intestinal crypt cells and negatively controls the expression of a subset of differentiation markers, in cultured cells and mice. H2A.Z impairs the recruitment of the intestine-specific transcription factor CDX2 to chromatin, is itself a target of the Wnt pathway and thus, acts as an integrator for Wnt signaling in the control of intestinal epithelial cell fate and homeostasis.",Nat Commun,2019,"['Rispal J', 'Baron L', 'Beaulieu JF', 'Chevillard-Briet M', 'Trouche D', 'Escaffit F']"
31015400,Corrupted coordination of epigenetic modifications leads to diverging chromatin states and transcriptional heterogeneity in CLL.,"Cancer evolution is fueled by epigenetic as well as genetic diversity. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), intra-tumoral DNA methylation (DNAme) heterogeneity empowers evolution. Here, to comprehensively study the epigenetic dimension of cancer evolution, we integrate DNAme analysis with histone modification mapping and single cell analyses of RNA expression and DNAme in 22 primary CLL and 13 healthy donor B lymphocyte samples. Our data reveal corrupted coherence across different layers of the CLL epigenome. This manifests in decreased mutual information across epigenetic modifications and gene expression attributed to cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Disrupted epigenetic-transcriptional coordination in CLL is also reflected in the dysregulation of the transcriptional output as a function of the combinatorial chromatin states, including incomplete Polycomb-mediated gene silencing. Notably, we observe unexpected co-mapping of typically mutually exclusive activating and repressing histone modifications, suggestive of intra-tumoral epigenetic diversity. Thus, CLL epigenetic diversification leads to decreased coordination across layers of epigenetic information, likely reflecting an admixture of cells with diverging cellular identities.",Nat Commun,2019,"['Pastore A', 'Gaiti F', 'Lu SX', 'Brand RM', 'Kulm S', 'Chaligne R', 'Gu H', 'Huang KY', 'Stamenova EK', 'Béguelin W', 'Jiang Y', 'Schulman RC', 'Kim KT', 'Alonso A', 'Allan JN', 'Furman RR', 'Gnirke A', 'Wu CJ', 'Melnick AM', 'Meissner A', 'Bernstein BE', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Landau DA']"

31015384,Chromatin structures condensed by linker histones.,"In eukaryotic cells, genomic DNA exists in the form of chromatin through association with histone proteins, which consist of four core histone (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) families and one linker histone (H1) family. The core histones bind to DNA to form the nucleosome, the recurring structural unit of chromatin. The linker histone binds to the nucleosome to form the next structural unit of chromatin, the chromatosome, which occurs dominantly in metazoans. Linker histones also play an essential role in condensing chromatin to form higher order structures. Unlike the core histones in the formation of the nucleosome, the role of linker histone in the formation of the chromatosome and high-order chromatin structure is not well understood. Nevertheless, exciting progress in the structural studies of chromatosomes and nucleosome arrays condensed by linker histones has been made in the last several years. In this mini-review, we discuss these recent experimental results and provide some perspectives for future studies.",Essays Biochem.,2019,"['Zhou BR', 'Bai Y']"
31015383,Histone variant macroH2A: from chromatin deposition to molecular function.,"The eukaryotic genome is regulated in the context of chromatin. Specialized histones, known as histone variants, incorporate into chromatin to replace their canonical counterparts and represent an important layer of regulation to diversify the structural characteristics and functional outputs of chromatin. MacroH2A is an unusual histone variant with a bulky C-terminal non-histone domain that distinguishes it from all other histones. It is a critical player in stabilizing differentiated cell identity by posing as a barrier to somatic cell reprogramming toward pluripotency and acts as a tumor suppressor in a wide range of cancers. MacroH2A histones are generally regarded as repressive variants that are enriched at the inactive X chromosome (Xi) and broad domains across autosomal chromatin. Recent studies have shed light on to how macroH2A influences transcriptional outputs within distinct genomic contexts and revealed new intriguing molecular functions of macroH2A variants beyond transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, the mechanisms of its mysterious chromatin deposition are beginning to be unraveled, facilitating our understanding of its complex regulation of genome function.",Essays Biochem.,2019,"['Sun Z', 'Bernstein E']"
31015382,The histone chaperoning pathway: from ribosome to nucleosome.,"Nucleosomes represent the fundamental repeating unit of eukaryotic DNA, and comprise eight core histones around which DNA is wrapped in nearly two superhelical turns. Histones do not have the intrinsic ability to form nucleosomes; rather, they require an extensive repertoire of interacting proteins collectively known as 'histone chaperones'. At a fundamental level, it is believed that histone chaperones guide the assembly of nucleosomes through preventing non-productive charge-based aggregates between the basic histones and acidic cellular components. At a broader level, histone chaperones influence almost all aspects of chromatin biology, regulating histone supply and demand, governing histone variant deposition, maintaining functional chromatin domains and being co-factors for histone post-translational modifications, to name a few. In this essay we review recent structural insights into histone-chaperone interactions, explore evidence for the existence of a histone chaperoning 'pathway' and reconcile how such histone-chaperone interactions may function thermodynamically to assemble nucleosomes and maintain chromatin homeostasis.",Essays Biochem.,2019,"['Pardal AJ', 'Fernandes-Duarte F', 'Bowman AJ']"

The centromere is the locus at which the kinetochore-the proteinaceous complex that ties chromosomes to microtubules-forms during mitosis and meiosis. Thus, the centromere is critical for equal segregation of chromosomes. The centromere is characterized by both protein and DNA elements: the histone H3 variant CENP-A epigenetically defines the location of the centromere while centromeric DNA sequences are neither necessary nor sufficient for centromere function. Paradoxically, the DNA sequences play a critical role in new centromere formation. In this essay, we discuss the contribution of both epigenetics and genetics at the centromere. Understanding these contributions is vital to efforts to control centromere formation on synthetic/artificial chromosomes and centromere strength on natural ones.",Essays Biochem.,2019,"['Gambogi CW', 'Black BE']"

Cell physiology and homeostasis is regulated by microRNAs in diverse microenvironment. In this investigation we have identified conserved miR-193a target sites within the 3'-UTR of MLL1 gene transcript. Utilizing wild type and mutated 3'-UTR constructs and luciferase reporter assays we have clearly demonstrated that miR-193a directly targets the 3'-UTR region of the MLL1 mRNA. Ectopic expression of miR-193a modulated global H3K4 mono-, di- and tri-methylation levels and affects the expression of CAV1, a gene which is specifically modulated by H3K4me3. To determine the implications of this in vitro finding in aberrant physiological conditions we analyzed prostate cancer tissue samples. In this context miR-193a RNA was undetectable and MLL1 was highly expressed with concomitantly high levels of H3K4me, H3K4me2, and H3K4me3 enrichment in the promoters of MLL1 responsive genes. Finally, we showed that prolonged ectopic expression of miR-193a inhibits growth and cell migration, and induces apoptosis. Thus, while our study unveils amplitude of the epigenome, including miRnome it establishes that; (i) miR-193a directly target MLL1 mRNA, (ii) miR-193a impair MLL1 protein production, (iii) miR-193a reduces the overall methylation marks of the genome.",Gene,2019,"['Sengupta D', 'Deb M', 'Kar S', 'Parbin S', 'Pradhan N', 'Patra SK']"
30992047,Abnormal level of CUL4B-mediated histone H2A ubiquitination causes disruptive HOX gene expression.,"BACKGROUND: Neural tube defects (NTDs) are common birth defects involving the central nervous system. Recent studies on the etiology of human NTDs have raised the possibility that epigenetic regulation could be involved in determining susceptibility to them.
RESULTS: Here, we show that the H2AK119ub1 E3 ligase CUL4B is required for the activation of retinoic acid (RA)-inducible developmentally critical homeobox (HOX) genes in NT2/D1 embryonal carcinoma cells. RA treatment led to attenuation of H2AK119ub1 due to decrease in CUL4B, further affecting HOX gene regulation. Furthermore, we found that CUL4B interacted directly with RORγ and negatively regulated its transcriptional activity. Interestingly, knockdown of RORγ decreased the expression of HOX genes along with increased H2AK119ub1 occupancy levels, at HOX gene sites in N2/D1 cells. In addition, upregulation of HOX genes was observed along with lower levels of CUL4B-mediated H2AK119ub1 in both mouse and human anencephaly NTD cases. Notably, the expression of HOXA10 genes was negatively correlated with CUL4B levels in human anencephaly NTD cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that abnormal HOX gene expression induced by aberrant CUL4B-mediated H2AK119ub1 levels may be a risk factor for NTDs, and highlight the need for further analysis of genome-wide epigenetic modifications in NTDs.",Epigenetics Chromatin,2019,"['Lin Y', 'Yu J', 'Wu J', 'Wang S', 'Zhang T']"
30988309,Structural basis of specific H2A K13/K15 ubiquitination by RNF168.,"Ubiquitination of chromatin by modification of histone H2A is a critical step in both regulation of DNA repair and regulation of cell fate. These very different outcomes depend on the selective modification of distinct lysine residues in H2A, each by a specific E3 ligase. While polycomb PRC1 complexes modify K119, resulting in gene silencing, the E3 ligase RNF168 modifies K13/15, which is a key event in the response to DNA double-strand breaks. The molecular origin of ubiquitination site specificity by these related E3 enzymes is one of the open questions in the field. Using a combination of NMR spectroscopy, crosslinking mass-spectrometry, mutagenesis and data-driven modelling, here we show that RNF168 binds the acidic patch on the nucleosome surface, directing the E2 to the target lysine. The structural model highlights the role of E3 and nucleosome in promoting ubiquitination and provides a basis for understanding and engineering of chromatin ubiquitination specificity.",Nat Commun,2019,"['Horn V', 'Uckelmann M', 'Zhang H', 'Eerland J', 'Aarsman I', 'le Paige UB', 'Davidovich C', 'Sixma TK', 'van Ingen H']"

30968131,Sensitive effect of linker histone binding mode and subtype on chromatin condensation.,"The complex role of linker histone (LH) on chromatin compaction regulation has been highlighted by recent discoveries of the effect of LH binding variability and isoforms on genome structure and function. Here we examine the effect of two LH variants and variable binding modes on the structure of chromatin fibers. Our mesoscale modeling considers oligonucleosomes with H1C and H1E, bound in three different on and off-dyad modes, and spanning different LH densities (0.5-1.6 per nucleosome), over a wide range of physiologically relevant nucleosome repeat lengths (NRLs). Our studies reveal an LH-variant and binding-mode dependent heterogeneous ensemble of fiber structures with variable packing ratios, sedimentation coefficients, and persistence lengths. For maximal compaction, besides dominantly interacting with parental DNA, LHs must have strong interactions with nonparental DNA and promote tail/nonparental core interactions. An off-dyad binding of H1E enables both; others compromise compaction for bendability. We also find that an increase of LH density beyond 1 is best accommodated in chromatosomes with one on-dyad and one off-dyad LH. We suggest that variable LH binding modes and concentrations are advantageous, allowing tunable levels of chromatin condensation and DNA accessibility/interactions. Thus, LHs add another level of epigenetic regulation of chromatin.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2019,"['Perišić O', 'Portillo-Ledesma S', 'Schlick T']"

Remodelers conserved from yeast to humans are classified into four families based on the domains and motifs present in their ATPase subunits. Insights into overall assembly and the mode of interaction to the nucleosome by these different families of remodelers remained limited due to the complexity of obtaining structural information on these challenging samples.

This activity is required for normal organismal development and maintenance of gene expression patterns to uphold cell identity. PRC2 function is often deregulated in disease and is a promising candidate for therapeutic targeting in cancer. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms proposed to take part in modulating PRC2 recruitment and shaping H3K27 methylation patterns across the genome. This includes consideration of factors influencing PRC2 residence time on chromatin and PRC2 catalytic activity with a focus on the mechanisms giving rise to regional preferences and differential deposition of H3K27 methylation.

30946839,Activation of KRas-ERK1/2 signaling drives the initiation and progression of glioma by suppressing the acetylation of histone H4 at lysine 16.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Acetylation of H4 at lysine 16 (H4K16ac) has been well-characterized as an acetylated mark, and the expression of which is closely associated with the tumorigenesis of human cancers. This study aimed to reveal whether KRas mutation drives the initiation and progression of glioma via modulation of H4 acetylation.
METHODS: Changes of H4K16 acetylation in human glioblastoma A172 cells following transfection with a plasmid for expression of mutant KRas were tested by western blot analysis. MTT assay, transwell assay, soft-agar colony formation assay, RT-PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation were carried out to evaluate the effect of H4K16ac on A172 cells growth and migration. Furthermore, the enzymes participating in the deacetylation of H4K16ac were studied by using RT-PCR and western blot analysis.
RESULTS: H4K16ac was found to be deacetylated by KRas-ERK1/2 activation. H4K16Q (a plasmid for mimicking H4K16ac) repressed A172 cells viability, colony formation, and migratory capacity. Besides, H4K16ac was capable of regulating the transcription of several ERK1/2 pathway downstream genes. KRas-ERK1/2 signaling repressed H4 acetylation at K16 via modulation of a histone deacetylase Sirt2, as well as a histone acetyl-transferase TIP60. Moreover, KRas-ERK1/2 inhibited TIP60 via an MDM2-dependnet fashion.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that activation of KRas-ERK1/2 signaling participates in the onset and progression of glioma at least partially through modulating acetylation of H4 at K16. KRas-ERK1/2 signaling mediates the acetylation of H4K16 via Sirt2 and MDM2-dependnet degeneration of TIP60.",Life Sci.,2019,"['Wei Y', 'Wang F', 'Sang B', 'Xu Z', 'Yang D']"
30940741,Acetylation & Co: an expanding repertoire of histone acylations regulates chromatin and transcription.,"Packaging the long and fragile genomes of eukaryotic species into nucleosomes is all well and good, but how do cells gain access to the DNA again after it has been bundled away? The solution, in every species from yeast to man, is to post-translationally modify histones, altering their chemical properties to either relax the chromatin, label it for remodelling or make it more compact still. Histones are subject to a myriad of modifications: acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination etc. This review focuses on histone acylations, a diverse group of modifications which occur on the ε-amino group of Lysine residues and includes the well-characterised Lysine acetylation. Over the last 50 years, histone acetylation has been extensively characterised, with the discovery of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), and global mapping experiments, revealing an association of hyperacetylated histones with accessible, transcriptionally active chromatin. More recently, there has been an explosion in the number of unique short chain 'acylations' identified by MS, including: propionylation, butyrylation, crotonylation, succinylation, malonylation and 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation. These novel modifications add a range of chemical environments to histones, and similar to acetylation, appear to accumulate at transcriptional start sites and correlate with gene activity.",Essays Biochem.,2019,"['Barnes CE', 'English DM', 'Cowley SM']"
30925865,HDAC6 is associated with the formation of aortic dissection in human.,"BACKGROUND: The pathological features of aortic dissection (AD) include vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) loss, elastic fiber fraction, and inflammatory responses in the aorta. However, little is known about the post-translational modification mechanisms responsible for these biological processes.
METHODS: A total of 72 aorta samples, used for protein detection, were collected from 36 coronary artery disease (CAD, served as the control) patients and 36 type A AD (TAAD) patients. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR was used to identify the genes regulated by H3K23ac, and tubastatin A, an inhibitor of HDAC6, was utilized to clarify the downstream mechanisms regulated by HDAC6.
RESULTS: We found that the protein level of histone deacetylase HDAC6 was reduced in the aortas of patients suffering from TAAD and that the protein levels of H4K12ac, and H3K23ac significantly increased, while H3K18ac, H4K8ac, and H4K5ac dramatically decreased when compared with CAD patients. Although H3K23ac, H3K18ac, and H4K8ac increased in the human VSMCs after treatment with the HDAC6 inhibitor tubastatin A, only H3K23ac showed the same results in human tissues. Notably, the results of ChIP-PCR demonstrated that H3K23ac was enriched in extracellular matrix (ECM)-related genes, including Col1A2, Col3A1, CTGF, POSTN, MMP2, TIMP2, and ACTA2, in the aortic samples of TAAD patients. In addition, our results showed that HDAC6 regulates H4K20me2 and p-MEK1/2 in the pathological process of TAAD.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that HDAC6 is involved in human TAAD formation by regulating H3K23ac, H4K20me2 and p-MEK1/2, thus, providing a strategy for the treatment of TAAD by targeting protein post-translational modifications (PTMs), chiefly histone PTMs.",Mol.

30923829,Chromatin regulation by Histone H4 acetylation at Lysine 16 during cell death and differentiation in the myeloid compartment.,"Histone H4 acetylation at Lysine 16 (H4K16ac) is a key epigenetic mark involved in gene regulation, DNA repair and chromatin remodeling, and though it is known to be essential for embryonic development, its role during adult life is still poorly understood. Here we show that this lysine is massively hyperacetylated in peripheral neutrophils. Genome-wide mapping of H4K16ac in terminally differentiated blood cells, along with functional experiments, supported a role for this histone post-translational modification in the regulation of cell differentiation and apoptosis in the hematopoietic system. Furthermore, in neutrophils, H4K16ac was enriched at specific DNA repeats. These DNA regions presented an accessible chromatin conformation and were associated with the cleavage sites that generate the 50 kb DNA fragments during the first stages of programmed cell death. Our results thus suggest that H4K16ac plays a dual role in myeloid cells as it not only regulates differentiation and apoptosis, but it also exhibits a non-canonical structural role in poising chromatin for cleavage at an early stage of neutrophil cell death.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2019,"['Urdinguio RG', 'Lopez V', 'Bayón GF', 'Diaz de la Guardia R', 'Sierra MI', 'García-Toraño E', 'Perez RF', 'García MG', 'Carella A', 'Pruneda PC', 'Prieto C', 'Dmitrijeva M', 'Santamarina P', 'Belmonte T', 'Mangas C', 'Diaconu E', 'Ferrero C', 'Tejedor JR', 'Fernandez-Morera JL', 'Bravo C', 'Bueno C', 'Sanjuan-Pla A', 'Rodriguez RM', 'Suarez-Alvarez B', 'López-Larrea C', 'Bernal T', 'Colado E', 'Balbín M', 'García-Suarez O', 'Chiara MD', 'Sáenz-de-Santa-María I', 'Rodríguez F', 'Pando-Sandoval A', 'Rodrigo L', 'Santos L', 'Salas A', 'Vallejo-Díaz J', 'C Carrera A', 'Rico D', 'Hernández-López I', 'Vayá A', 'Ricart JM', 'Seto E', 'Sima-Teruel N', 'Vaquero A', 'Valledor L', 'Cañal MJ', 'Pisano D', 'Graña-Castro O', 'Thomas T', 'Voss AK', 'Menéndez P', 'Villar-Garea A', 'Deutzmann R', 'Fernandez AF', 'Fraga MF']"

The method is based on phasor image-correlation spectroscopy of histone fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM)-Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy data acquired in live cells coexpressing H2B-eGFP and H2B-mCherry. This multiplexed approach generates spatiotemporal maps of nuclear-wide chromatin compaction that, when coupled with laser microirradiation-induced DSBs, quantify the size, stability, and spacing between compact chromatin foci throughout the DDR. Using this technology, we identify that ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and RNF8 regulate rapid chromatin decompaction at DSBs and formation of compact chromatin foci surrounding the repair locus. This chromatin architecture serves to demarcate the repair locus from the surrounding nuclear environment and modulate 53BP1 mobility.",Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

30917778,Predicting enhancers in mammalian genomes using supervised hidden Markov models.,"BACKGROUND: Eukaryotic gene regulation is a complex process comprising the dynamic interaction of enhancers and promoters in order to activate gene expression. In recent years, research in regulatory genomics has contributed to a better understanding of the characteristics of promoter elements and for most sequenced model organism genomes there exist comprehensive and reliable promoter annotations. For enhancers, however, a reliable description of their characteristics and location has so far proven to be elusive. With the development of high-throughput methods such as ChIP-seq, large amounts of data about epigenetic conditions have become available, and many existing methods use the information on chromatin accessibility or histone modifications to train classifiers in order to segment the genome into functional groups such as enhancers and promoters. However, these methods often do not consider prior biological knowledge about enhancers such as their diverse lengths or molecular structure.
RESULTS: We developed enhancer HMM (eHMM), a supervised hidden Markov model designed to learn the molecular structure of promoters and enhancers. Both consist of a central stretch of accessible DNA flanked by nucleosomes with distinct histone modification patterns. We evaluated the performance of eHMM within and across cell types and developmental stages and found that eHMM successfully predicts enhancers with high precision and recall comparable to state-of-the-art methods, and consistently outperforms those in terms of accuracy and resolution.
CONCLUSIONS: eHMM predicts active enhancers based on data from chromatin accessibility assays and a minimal set of histone modification ChIP-seq experiments. In comparison to other 'black box' methods its parameters are easy to interpret. eHMM can be used as a stand-alone tool for enhancer prediction without the need for additional training or a tuning of parameters. The high spatial precision of enhancer predictions gives valuable targets for potential knockout experiments or downstream analyses such as motif search.",BMC Bioinformatics,2019,"['Zehnder T', 'Benner P', 'Vingron M']"
30894748,The expanding landscape of 'oncohistone' mutations in human cancers.,"Mutations in epigenetic pathways are common oncogenic drivers. Histones, the fundamental substrates for chromatin-modifying and remodelling enzymes, are mutated in tumours including gliomas, sarcomas, head and neck cancers, and carcinosarcomas. Classical 'oncohistone' mutations occur in the N-terminal tail of histone H3 and affect the function of polycomb repressor complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2). However, the prevalence and function of histone mutations in other tumour contexts is unknown. Here we show that somatic histone mutations occur in approximately 4% (at a conservative estimate) of diverse tumour types and in crucial regions of histone proteins. Mutations occur in all four core histones, in both the N-terminal tails and globular histone fold domains, and at or near residues that contain important post-translational modifications. Many globular domain mutations are homologous to yeast mutants that abrogate the need for SWI/SNF function, occur in the key regulatory 'acidic patch' of histones H2A and H2B, or are predicted to disrupt the H2B-H4 interface. The histone mutation dataset and the hypotheses presented here on the effect of the mutations on important chromatin functions should serve as a resource and starting point for the chromatin and cancer biology fields in exploring an expanding role of histone mutations in cancer.",Nature,2019,"['Nacev BA', 'Feng L', 'Bagert JD', 'Lemiesz AE', 'Gao J', 'Soshnev AA', 'Kundra R', 'Schultz N', 'Muir TW', 'Allis CD']"
30894545,Functional interplay between TFIIH and KAT2A regulates higher-order chromatin structure and class II gene expression.,"The TFIIH subunit XPB is involved in combined Xeroderma Pigmentosum and Cockayne syndrome (XP-B/CS). Our analyses reveal that XPB interacts functionally with KAT2A, a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) that belongs to the hSAGA and hATAC complexes. XPB interacts with KAT2A-containing complexes on chromatin and an XP-B/CS mutation specifically elicits KAT2A-mediated large-scale chromatin decondensation. In XP-B/CS cells, the abnormal recruitment of TFIIH and KAT2A to chromatin causes inappropriate acetylation of histone H3K9, leading to aberrant formation of transcription initiation complexes on the promoters of several hundred genes and their subsequent overexpression. Significantly, this cascade of events is similarly sensitive to KAT2A HAT inhibition or to the rescue with wild-type XPB. In agreement, the XP-B/CS mutation increases KAT2A HAT activity in vitro. Our results unveil a tight connection between TFIIH and KAT2A that controls higher-order chromatin structure and gene expression and provide new insights into transcriptional misregulation in a cancer-prone DNA repair-deficient disorder.",Nat Commun,2019,"['Sandoz J', 'Nagy Z', 'Catez P', 'Caliskan G', 'Geny S', 'Renaud JB', 'Concordet JP', 'Poterszman A', 'Tora L', 'Egly JM', 'Le May N', 'Coin F']"
30894531,Reversible histone glycation is associated with disease-related changes in chromatin architecture.,"Cellular proteins continuously undergo non-enzymatic covalent modifications (NECMs) that accumulate under normal physiological conditions and are stimulated by changes in the cellular microenvironment. Glycation, the hallmark of diabetes, is a prevalent NECM associated with an array of pathologies. Histone proteins are particularly susceptible to NECMs due to their long half-lives and nucleophilic disordered tails that undergo extensive regulatory modifications; however, histone NECMs remain poorly understood. Here we perform a detailed analysis of histone glycation in vitro and in vivo and find it has global ramifications on histone enzymatic PTMs, the assembly and stability of nucleosomes, and chromatin architecture. Importantly, we identify a physiologic regulation mechanism, the enzyme DJ-1, which functions as a potent histone deglycase. Finally, we detect intense histone glycation and DJ-1 overexpression in breast cancer tumors. Collectively, our results suggest an additional mechanism for cellular metabolic damage through epigenetic perturbation, with implications in pathogenesis.",Nat Commun,2019,"['Zheng Q', 'Omans ND', 'Leicher R', 'Osunsade A', 'Agustinus AS', 'Finkin-Groner E', ""D'Ambrosio H"", 'Liu B', 'Chandarlapaty S', 'Liu S', 'David Y']"

Here we use primary H3K27M tumor lines and isogenic CRISPR-edited controls to assess H3K27M effects in vitro and in vivo. We find that whereas H3K27me3 and H3K27me2 are normally deposited by PRC2 across broad regions, their deposition is severely reduced in H3.3K27M cells. H3K27me3 is unable to spread from large unmethylated CpG islands, while H3K27me2 can be deposited outside these PRC2 high-affinity sites but to levels corresponding to H3K27me3 deposition in wild-type cells. Our findings indicate that PRC2 recruitment and propagation on chromatin are seemingly unaffected by K27M, which mostly impairs spread of the repressive marks it catalyzes, especially H3K27me3. Genome-wide loss of H3K27me3 and me2 deposition has limited transcriptomic consequences, preferentially affecting lowly-expressed genes regulating neurogenesis. Removal of H3K27M restores H3K27me2/me3 spread, impairs cell proliferation, and completely abolishes their capacity to form tumors in mice.",Nat Commun,2019,"['Harutyunyan AS', 'Krug B', 'Chen H', 'Papillon-Cavanagh S', 'Zeinieh M', 'De Jay N', 'Deshmukh S', 'Chen CCL', 'Belle J', 'Mikael LG', 'Marchione DM', 'Li R', 'Nikbakht H', 'Hu B', 'Cagnone G', 'Cheung WA', 'Mohammadnia A', 'Bechet D', 'Faury D', 'McConechy MK', 'Pathania M', 'Jain SU', 'Ellezam B', 'Weil AG', 'Montpetit A', 'Salomoni P', 'Pastinen T', 'Lu C', 'Lewis PW', 'Garcia BA', 'Kleinman CL', 'Jabado N', 'Majewski J']"
30890697,Staged developmental mapping and X chromosome transcriptional dynamics during mouse spermatogenesis.,"Male gametes are generated through a specialised differentiation pathway involving a series of developmental transitions that are poorly characterised at the molecular level. Here, we use droplet-based single-cell RNA-Sequencing to profile spermatogenesis in adult animals and at multiple stages during juvenile development. By exploiting the first wave of spermatogenesis, we both precisely stage germ cell development and enrich for rare somatic cell-types and spermatogonia. To capture the full complexity of spermatogenesis including cells that have low transcriptional activity, we apply a statistical tool that identifies previously uncharacterised populations of leptotene and zygotene spermatocytes. Focusing on post-meiotic events, we characterise the temporal dynamics of X chromosome re-activation and profile the associated chromatin state using CUT&RUN. This identifies a set of genes strongly repressed by H3K9me3 in spermatocytes, which then undergo extensive chromatin remodelling post-meiosis, thus acquiring an active chromatin state and spermatid-specific expression.",Nat Commun,2019,"['Ernst C', 'Eling N', 'Martinez-Jimenez CP', 'Marioni JC', 'Odom DT']"
30889214,Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome associated mutations of RNase H2B impair its interaction with ZMYM3 and the CoREST histone-modifying complex.,"DNA-RNA hybrids arise in all cell types, and are removed by multiple enzymes, including the trimeric ribonuclease, RNase H2. Mutations in human RNase H2 result in Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS), an inflammatory brain disorder notable for being a Mendelian mimic of congenital viral infection. Previous studies have shown that several AGS-associated mutations of the RNase H2B subunit do not affect trimer stability or catalytic activity and are clustered on the surface of the complex, leading us to speculate that these mutations might impair important interactions of RNase H2 with so far unidentified proteins. In this study, we show that AGS mutations in this cluster impair the interaction of RNase H2 with several members of the CoREST chromatin-silencing complex that include the histone deacetylase HDAC2 and the demethylase KDM1A, the transcriptional regulators RCOR1 and GTFII-I as well as ZMYM3, an MYM-type zinc finger protein. We also show that the interaction is mediated by the zinc finger protein ZMYM3, suggesting that ZMYM3 acts as a novel type of scaffold protein coordinating interactions between deacetylase, demethylase and RNase H type enzymes, raising the question of whether coordination between histone modifications and the degradation of RNA-DNA hybrids may be required to prevent inflammation in humans.",PLoS ONE,2019,"['Shapson-Coe A', 'Valeiras B', 'Wall C', 'Rada C']"

30876814,Quantification of histones and protamines mRNA transcripts in sperms of infertile couples and their impact on sperm's quality and chromatin integrity.,"The proper transition of histones to protamine during spermiogenesis is critical for male fertility. This study aimed to quantify the levels of histones and protamines mRNA in sperms of infertile couples and their possible effect on the sperm's quality and chromatin integrity. Spermatozoa from 53 normal and 75 patients were enrolled in this study. Histones and Protamine mRNAs were extracted, reverse-transcribed and applied to real-time quantitative PCR. Chromomycin A3 staining was used to assess protamination and chromatin integrity, and Eosin-Nigrosine-Test and HOS-Test was used to evaluate the sperm's vitality and membrane integrity respectively. Levels of histones H2A and H2B mRNA in patient's sperms were significantly (p < 0.01) higher than that of normal (31.22 ± 2.91, 30.03 ± 2.05 vs. 25.62 ± 1.98, 27.23 ± 3.04, respectively). Protamine PRM2 mRNA in patient's sperms (20.55 ± 2.01) was significantly lower than in normal (21.73 ± 2.64, p < 0.01). The PRM1/PRM2 and H2A/H2B mRNAs ratios were significantly higher (p < 0.01) in patients than normal (1.02 ± 0.10, 1.04 ± 0.07 vs. 0.98 ± 0.06, 0.94 ± 0.08 respectively). Also, the sperm's nuclear histones to protamines transcripts ((H2A + H2B)/(PRM1 + PRM2)) ratios of patients (1.49 ± 0.16) was significantly higher (p < 0.01) than that of normal (1.25 ± 0.15). Histone/protamine transcripts [((H2A + H2B)/(PRM1 + PRM2)) mRNAs ratios] were negatively correlated (p < 0.05) with sperm's count, total count, motility, progressive motility, normal morphology, membrane integrity and positively with chromatin decondensation. The data suggests that histones/protamines mRNAs ratios are important for a sperm's quality and therefore could be used as predictors for male infertility.

30872526,Hypoxia induces rapid changes to histone methylation and reprograms chromatin.,"Oxygen is essential for the life of most multicellular organisms. Cells possess enzymes called molecular dioxygenases that depend on oxygen for activity. A subclass of molecular dioxygenases is the histone demethylase enzymes, which are characterized by the presence of a Jumanji-C (JmjC) domain. Hypoxia can alter chromatin, but whether this is a direct effect on JmjC-histone demethylases or due to other mechanisms is unknown. Here, we report that hypoxia induces a rapid and hypoxia-inducible factor-independent induction of histone methylation in a range of human cultured cells. Genomic locations of histone-3 lysine-4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and H3K36me3 after a brief exposure of cultured cells to hypoxia predict the cell's transcriptional response several hours later. We show that inactivation of one of the JmjC-containing enzymes, lysine demethylase 5A (KDM5A), mimics hypoxia-induced cellular responses. These results demonstrate that oxygen sensing by chromatin occurs via JmjC-histone demethylase inhibition.",Science,2019,"['Batie M', 'Frost J', 'Frost M', 'Wilson JW', 'Schofield P', 'Rocha S']"
30872525,Histone demethylase KDM6A directly senses oxygen to control chromatin and cell fate.,"Oxygen sensing is central to metazoan biology and has implications for human disease. Mammalian cells express multiple oxygen-dependent enzymes called 2-oxoglutarate (OG)-dependent dioxygenases (2-OGDDs), but they vary in their oxygen affinities and hence their ability to sense oxygen. The 2-OGDD histone demethylases control histone methylation. Hypoxia increases histone methylation, but whether this reflects direct effects on histone demethylases or indirect effects caused by the hypoxic induction of the HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) transcription factor or the 2-OG antagonist 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) is unclear. Here, we report that hypoxia promotes histone methylation in a HIF- and 2-HG-independent manner. We found that the H3K27 histone demethylase KDM6A/UTX, but not its paralog KDM6B, is oxygen sensitive. KDM6A loss, like hypoxia, prevented H3K27 demethylation and blocked cellular differentiation. Restoring H3K27 methylation homeostasis in hypoxic cells reversed these effects. Thus, oxygen directly affects chromatin regulators to control cell fate.",Science,2019,"['Chakraborty AA', 'Laukka T', 'Myllykoski M', 'Ringel AE', 'Booker MA', 'Tolstorukov MY', 'Meng YJ', 'Meier SR', 'Jennings RB', 'Creech AL', 'Herbert ZT', 'McBrayer SK', 'Olenchock BA', 'Jaffe JD', 'Haigis MC', 'Beroukhim R', 'Signoretti S', 'Koivunen P', 'Kaelin WG']"

Using stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture and nano-liqud chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry, we found that phosphorylation motifs targeted by the kinases protein kinase C, cyclin-dependent kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase showed increased phosphorylation during myodifferentiation of LHCN-M2 human skeletal myoblast cell line. Drugs known to inhibit these kinases either promoted (PD0325901 and GW8510) or stalled (CHIR99021 and roscovitine) differentiation, resulting in myotube and myoblast phenotypes, respectively. The proteomes, especially the myogenic and chromatin-related proteins including histone methyltransferases, correlated with their phenotypes, leading us to quantify histone post-translational modifications and identify two gene-silencing marks, H3K9me3 and H4K20me3, with relative abundances changing in correlation with these phenotypes.

30867030,The hyper-activation of transcriptional enhancers in breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Activation of transcription enhancers, especially super-enhancers, is one of the critical epigenetic features of tumorigenesis. However, very few studies have systematically identified the enhancers specific in cancer tissues.
METHODS: Here, we studied the change of histone modifications in MMTV-PyVT breast cancer model, combining mass spectrometry-based proteomics and ChIP-seq-based epigenomics approaches. Some of the proteomic results were confirmed with western blotting and IHC staining. An inhibitor of H3K27ac was applied to study its effect on cancer development.
RESULTS: H3K27ac and H4K8ac are elevated in cancer, which was confirmed in patient tissue chips. ChIP-seq revealed that H4K8ac is co-localized with H3K27ac on chromatin, especially on distal enhancers. Epigenomic studies further identified a subgroup of super-enhancers marked by H3K4me3 peaks in the intergenic regions. The H3K4me3-enriched regions enhancers are associated with higher level of H3K27ac and H4K8ac compared with the average level of conventional super-enhancers and are associated with higher transcription level of their adjacent genes. We identified 148 H3K4me3-enriched super-enhancers with higher gene expression in tumor, which may be critical for breast cancer. One inhibitor for p300 and H3K27ac, C646, repressed tumor formation probably through inhibiting Vegfa and other genes.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our work identifies novel regulators and provides important resource to the genome-wide enhancer studies in breast cancer and raises the possibility of cancer treatment through modulating enhancer activity.",Clin Epigenetics,2019,"['Li QL', 'Wang DY', 'Ju LG', 'Yao J', 'Gao C', 'Lei PJ', 'Li LY', 'Zhao XL', 'Wu M']"
30865665,Nucleosome DNA unwrapping does not affect prototype foamy virus integration efficiency or site selection.,"Eukaryotic DNA binding proteins must access genomic DNA that is packaged into chromatin in vivo. During a productive infection, retroviral integrases (IN) must similarly interact with chromatin to integrate the viral cDNA genome. Here we examine the role of nucleosome DNA unwrapping in the retroviral integrase search for a target site. These studies utilized PFV intasomes that are comprised of a tetramer of PFV IN with two oligomers mimicking the viral cDNA ends. Modified recombinant human histones were used to generate nucleosomes with increased unwrapping rates at different DNA regions. These modifications included the acetylmimetic H3(K56Q) and the chemically engineered H4(K77ac, K79ac). While transcription factors and DNA damage sensors may search nucleosome bound DNA during transient unwrapping, PFV intasome mediated integration appears to be unaffected by increased nucleosome unwrapping. These studies suggest PFV intasomes do not utilize nucleosome unwrapping to search nucleosome targets.",PLoS ONE,2019,"['Mackler RM', 'Jones ND', 'Gardner AM', 'Lopez MA', 'Howard CJ', 'Fishel R', 'Yoder KE']"
30850548,Mechanism for autoinhibition and activation of the MORC3 ATPase.,"Microrchidia 3 (MORC3) is a human protein linked to autoimmune disorders, Down syndrome, and cancer. It is a member of a newly identified family of human ATPases with an uncharacterized mechanism of action. Here, we elucidate the molecular basis for inhibition and activation of MORC3. The crystal structure of the MORC3 region encompassing the ATPase and CW domains in complex with a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog demonstrates that the two domains are directly coupled. The extensive ATPase:CW interface stabilizes the protein fold but inhibits the catalytic activity of MORC3. Enzymatic, NMR, mutational, and biochemical analyses show that in the autoinhibited, off state, the CW domain sterically impedes binding of the ATPase domain to DNA, which in turn is required for the catalytic activity. MORC3 autoinhibition is released by disrupting the intramolecular ATPase:CW coupling through the competitive interaction of CW with histone H3 tail or by mutating the interfacial residues. Binding of CW to H3 leads to a marked rearrangement in the ATPase-CW cassette, which frees the DNA-binding site in active MORC3 (on state). We show that ATP-induced dimerization of the ATPase domain is strictly required for the catalytic activity and that the dimeric form of ATPase-CW might cooperatively bind to dsDNA. Together, our findings uncovered a mechanism underlying the fine-tuned regulation of the catalytic domain of MORC3 by the epigenetic reader, CW.",Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We quantitatively interrogate these relationships by comparing Hi-C and molecular phenotype data across cell types and haplotypes. While chromatin loops consistently form across different cell types, they have subtle quantitative differences in contact frequency that are associated with larger changes in gene expression and H3K27ac. For the vast majority of loci with quantitative differences in contact frequency across haplotypes, the changes in magnitude are smaller than those across cell types; however, the proportional relationships between contact propensity, gene expression, and H3K27ac are consistent. These findings suggest that subtle changes in contact propensity have a biologically meaningful role in gene regulation and could be a mechanism by which regulatory genetic variants in loop anchors mediate effects on expression.",Nat Commun,2019,"['Greenwald WW', 'Li H', 'Benaglio P', 'Jakubosky D', 'Matsui H', 'Schmitt A', 'Selvaraj S', ""D'Antonio M"", ""D'Antonio-Chronowska A"", 'Smith EN', 'Frazer KA']"

In addition to four core subunits, PRC2 comprises multiple accessory subunits that vary in their composition during cellular differentiation and define two major holo-PRC2 complexes: PRC2.1 and PRC2.2. PRC2 binds to RNA, which inhibits its enzymatic activity, but the mechanism of RNA-mediated inhibition of holo-PRC2 is poorly understood. Here we present in vivo and in vitro protein-RNA interaction maps and identify an RNA-binding patch within the allosteric regulatory site of human and mouse PRC2, adjacent to the methyltransferase center. RNA-mediated inhibition of holo-PRC2 is relieved by allosteric activation of PRC2 by H3K27me3 and JARID2-K116me3 peptides.

30833073,Role for tyrosine phosphorylation of SUV39H1 histone methyltransferase in enhanced trimethylation of histone H3K9 via neuregulin-1/ErbB4 nuclear signaling.,"Protein-tyrosine kinases transmit signals by phosphorylating their substrates in diverse cellular events. The receptor-type tyrosine kinase ErbB4, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor subfamily, is activated and proteolytically cleaved upon ligand stimulation, and the cleaved ErbB4 intracellular domain (4ICD) is released into the cytoplasm and the nucleus. We previously showed that generation of nuclear 4ICD by neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) stimulation enhances the levels of trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me3). However, it remains unclear how nuclear 4ICD enhances H3K9me3 levels. Here we show that the histone H3K9 methyltransferase SUV39H1 associates with NRG-1/ErbB4-mediated H3K9me3. Knockdown of SUV39H1 blocked NRG-1-mediated enhancement of the levels of H3K9me3. Nuclear 4ICD was found to phosphorylate SUV39H1 primarily at Tyr-297, -303, and -308 that are conserved among humans, mice, and flies. Furthermore, knockdown-rescue experiments showed that the unphosphorylatable SUV39H1 mutant (3 YF) was incapable of enhancing the levels of H3K9me3 upon NRG-1 stimulation. These results suggest that nuclear ErbB4 enhances H3K9me3 levels through tyrosine phosphorylation of SUV39H1 in NRG-1/ErbB4 signal-mediated chromatin remodeling.",Biochem. Biophys. Res.

30823596,Histone Modifications and the Maintenance of Telomere Integrity.,"Telomeres, the nucleoprotein structures at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, play an integral role in protecting linear DNA from degradation. Dysregulation of telomeres can result in genomic instability and has been implicated in increased rates of cellular senescence and many diseases, including cancer. The integrity of telomeres is maintained by a coordinated network of proteins and RNAs, such as the telomerase holoenzyme and protective proteins that prevent the recognition of the telomere ends as a DNA double-strand breaks. The structure of chromatin at telomeres and within adjacent subtelomeres has been implicated in telomere maintenance pathways in model systems and humans. Specific post-translational modifications of histones, including methylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination, have been shown to be necessary for maintaining a chromatin environment that promotes telomere integrity. Here we review the current knowledge regarding the role of histone modifications in maintaining telomeric and subtelomeric chromatin, discuss the implications of histone modification marks as they relate to human disease, and highlight key areas for future research.",Cells,2019,"['Jezek M', 'Green EM']"
30818116,Male exposure to bisphenol a impairs spermatogenesis and triggers histone hyperacetylation in zebrafish testes.,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disruptor whose ubiquitous presence in the environment has been related with impairment of male reproduction. BPA can cause both transcriptomic and epigenetic changes during spermatogenesis. To evaluate the potential effects of male exposure to BPA, adult zebrafish males were exposed during spermatogenesis to doses of 100 and 2000 μg/L, which were reported in contaminated water bodies and higher than those allowed for human consumption. Fertilization capacity and survival at hatching were analysed after mating with untreated females. Spermatogenic progress was analysed through a morphometrical study of testes and apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL assay. Testicular gene expression was evaluated by RT-qPCR and epigenetics by using ELISA and immunocytochemistry. In vitro studies were performed to investigate the role of Gper. Chromatin fragmentation and the presence of transcripts were also evaluated in ejaculated sperm. Results on testes from males treated with the highest dose showed a significant decrease in spermatocytes, an increase in apoptosis, a downregulation of ccnb1 and sycp3, all of which point to an alteration of spermatogenesis and to meiotic arrest and an upregulation of gper1 and esrrga receptors. Additionally, BPA at 2000 μg/L caused missregulation of epigenetic remodelling enzymes transcripts in testes and promoted DNA hypermethylation and H3K27me3 demethylation. BPA also triggered an increase in histone acetyltransferase activity, which led to hyperacetylation of histones (H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H4K12ac). In vitro reversion of histone acetylation changes using a specific GPER antagonist, G-36, suggested this receptor as mediator of histone hyperacetylation. Males treated with the lower dose only showed an increase in some histone acetylation marks (H3K14ac, H4K12ac) but their progeny displayed very limited survival at hatching, revealing the deleterious effects of unbalanced paternal epigenetic information. Furthermore, the highest dose of BPA led to chromatin fragmentation, promoting direct reproductive effects, which are incompatible with embryo development.",Environ.

30808399,Differences in expression rather than methylation at placenta-specific imprinted loci is associated with intrauterine growth restriction.,"BACKGROUND: Genome-wide studies have begun to link subtle variations in both allelic DNA methylation and parent-of-origin genetic effects with early development. Numerous reports have highlighted that the placenta plays a critical role in coordinating fetal growth, with many key functions regulated by genomic imprinting. With the recent description of wide-spread polymorphic placenta-specific imprinting, the molecular mechanisms leading to this curious polymorphic epigenetic phenomenon is unknown, as is their involvement in pregnancies complications.
RESULTS: Profiling of 35 ubiquitous and 112 placenta-specific imprinted differentially methylated regions (DMRs) using high-density methylation arrays and pyrosequencing revealed isolated aberrant methylation at ubiquitous DMRs as well as abundant hypomethylation at placenta-specific DMRs. Analysis of the underlying chromatin state revealed that the polymorphic nature is not only evident at the level of allelic methylation, but DMRs can also adopt an unusual epigenetic signature where the underlying histones are biallelically enrichment of H3K4 methylation, a modification normally mutually exclusive with DNA methylation. Quantitative expression analysis in placenta identified two genes, GPR1-AS1 and ZDBF2, that were differentially expressed between IUGRs and control samples after adjusting for clinical factors, revealing coordinated deregulation at the chromosome 2q33 imprinted locus.
CONCLUSIONS: DNA methylation is less stable at placenta-specific imprinted DMRs compared to ubiquitous DMRs and contributes to privileged state of the placenta epigenome. IUGR-associated expression differences were identified for several imprinted transcripts independent of allelic methylation. Further work is required to determine if these differences are the cause IUGR or reflect unique adaption by the placenta to developmental stresses.",Clin Epigenetics,2019,"['Monteagudo-Sánchez A', 'Sánchez-Delgado M', 'Mora JRH', 'Santamaría NT', 'Gratacós E', 'Esteller M', 'de Heredia ML', 'Nunes V', 'Choux C', 'Fauque P', 'de Nanclares GP', 'Anton L', 'Elovitz MA', 'Iglesias-Platas I', 'Monk D']"

30799487,Depletion of the RNA binding protein HNRNPD impairs homologous recombination by inhibiting DNA-end resection and inducing R-loop accumulation.,"DNA double strand break (DSB) repair through homologous recombination (HR) is crucial to maintain genome stability. DSB resection generates a single strand DNA intermediate, which is crucial for the HR process. We used a synthetic DNA structure, mimicking a resection intermediate, as a bait to identify proteins involved in this process. Among these, LC/MS analysis identified the RNA binding protein, HNRNPD. We found that HNRNPD binds chromatin, although this binding occurred independently of DNA damage. However, upon damage, HNRNPD re-localized to γH2Ax foci and its silencing impaired CHK1 S345 phosphorylation and the DNA end resection process. Indeed, HNRNPD silencing reduced: the ssDNA fraction upon camptothecin treatment; AsiSI-induced DSB resection; and RPA32 S4/8 phosphorylation. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HNRNPD knockout impaired in vitro DNA resection and sensitized cells to camptothecin and olaparib treatment. We found that HNRNPD interacts with the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein SAF-A previously associated with DNA damage repair. HNRNPD depletion resulted in an increased amount of RNA:DNA hybrids upon DNA damage. Both the expression of RNase H1 and RNA pol II inhibition recovered the ability to phosphorylate RPA32 S4/8 in HNRNPD knockout cells upon DNA damage, suggesting that RNA:DNA hybrid resolution likely rescues the defective DNA damage response of HNRNPD-depleted cells.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2019,"['Alfano L', 'Caporaso A', 'Altieri A', ""Dell'Aquila M"", 'Landi C', 'Bini L', 'Pentimalli F', 'Giordano A']"
30794748,Installation of Trimethyllysine Analogs on Intact Histones via Cysteine Alkylation.,"Site-specific incorporation of post-translationally modified amino acids into proteins, including histones, has been a subject of great interest for chemical and biochemical communities. Here, we describe a site-specific incorporation of structurally simplest trimethyllysine analogs into position 4 of the intact histone H3 protein. An efficient alkylation of cysteine 4 of the recombinantly expressed histone H3 provides a panel of trimethyllysine analogs that differ in charge, charge density, sterics, and chain length. We demonstrate that H3 histone that bears trimethyllysine analogs can be further assembled into the octameric histone complex that constitutes the nucleosome. Binding studies showed that H3 histone that possesses trimethyllysine analogs is well recognized by a PHD3 reader domain of human JARID1A. This work provides important (bio)chemical tools for fundamental biomolecular studies aimed at unravelling the molecular basis of the higher order nucleosome and chromatin assemblies.",Bioconjug.

30787263,Histone H1 quantity determines the efficiencies of apoptotic DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation.,"Oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation are two hallmarks of apoptosis. However, their generation mechanisms are not entirely understood. Histone H1, a positively charged nuclear protein located in the linker region of chromatin, is involved in higher-order chromatin structures and tight chromatin packing. On the basis of the physical and biochemical characteristics of histone H1, we hypothesized that histone H1 plays a role in determining the efficiencies of apoptotic DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation. Therefore, we examined histone H1 quantity in five human leukemia cell lines and compared the efficiencies. The cell lines were categorized into two groups according to their origins: (i) Ramos and Molt-4 cells of lymphoid origin and (ii) U937, ML-1, and HL60 cells of myeloid origin. Compared to the lymphoid-origin group, the myeloid-origin group had lower levels of histone H1 but more open chromatin. Furthermore, the myeloid-origin group showed marked DNA fragmentation but less chromatin condensation during apoptosis. These results suggested that histone H1 determined chromatin structure and that its quantity affected the efficiencies of DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation in apoptosis.",Biomed.

30773298,Histone Acetyltransferase p300 Induces De Novo Super-Enhancers to Drive Cellular Senescence.,"Accumulation of senescent cells during aging contributes to chronic inflammation and age-related diseases. While senescence is associated with profound alterations of the epigenome, a systematic view of epigenetic factors in regulating senescence is lacking. Here, we curated a library of short hairpin RNAs for targeted silencing of all known epigenetic proteins and performed a high-throughput screen to identify key candidates whose downregulation can delay replicative senescence of primary human cells. This screen identified multiple new players including the histone acetyltransferase p300 that was found to be a primary driver of the senescent phenotype. p300, but not the paralogous CBP, induces a dynamic hyper-acetylated chromatin state and promotes the formation of active enhancer elements in the non-coding genome, leading to a senescence-specific gene expression program. Our work illustrates a causal role of histone acetyltransferases and acetylation in senescence and suggests p300 as a potential therapeutic target for senescence and age-related diseases.",Mol.

30765112,Mechanism of Cross-talk between H2B Ubiquitination and H3 Methylation by Dot1L.,"Methylation of histone H3 K79 by Dot1L is a hallmark of actively transcribed genes that depends on monoubiquitination of H2B K120 (H2B-Ub) and is an example of histone modification cross-talk that is conserved from yeast to humans. We report here cryo-EM structures of Dot1L bound to ubiquitinated nucleosome that show how H2B-Ub stimulates Dot1L activity and reveal a role for the histone H4 tail in positioning Dot1L. We find that contacts mediated by Dot1L and the H4 tail induce a conformational change in the globular core of histone H3 that reorients K79 from an inaccessible position, thus enabling this side chain to insert into the active site in a position primed for catalysis. Our study provides a comprehensive mechanism of cross-talk between histone ubiquitination and methylation and reveals structural plasticity in histones that makes it possible for histone-modifying enzymes to access residues within the nucleosome core.",Cell,2019,"['Worden EJ', 'Hoffmann NA', 'Hicks CW', 'Wolberger C']"

UTX function has been linked to homeotic gene expression, embryonic development, and cellular reprogramming. UTX and its protein interactors within the COMPASS family, including the MLL3 and MLL4 lysine methyltransferases, are frequently mutated in multiple human cancers; however, the molecular basis of how these mutations contribute to oncogenesis remains unclear.

30736768,Transcriptomic and ChIP-sequence interrogation of EGFR signaling in HER2+ breast cancer cells reveals a dynamic chromatin landscape and S100 genes as targets.,"BACKGROUND: The Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR/HER1) can be activated by several ligands including Transforming Growth Factor alpha (TGF-α) and Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF). Following ligand binding, EGFR heterodimerizes with other HER family members, such as HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor-2). Previously, we showed that the EGFR is upregulated in trastuzumab resistant HER2 positive (HER2+) breast cancer cells. This study is aimed to determine the downstream effects on transcription following EGFR upregulation in HER2+ breast cancer cells.
METHODS: RNA-sequence and ChIP-sequence for H3K18ac and H3K27ac (Histone H3 lysine K18 and K27 acetylation) were conducted following an Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) treatment time course in HER2+ breast cancer cells, SKBR3. The levels of several proteins of interest were confirmed by western blot analysis. The cellular localization of proteins of interest was examined using biochemically fractionated lysates followed by western blot analysis.
RESULTS: Over the course of 24 h, EGFR stimulation resulted in the modulation of over 4000 transcripts. Moreover, our data demonstrates that EGFR/HER2 signaling regulates the epigenome, with global H3K18ac and H3K27ac oscillating as a function of time following EGF treatment. RNA-sequence data demonstrates the activation of immediate early genes (IEGs) and delayed early genes (DEGs) within 1 h of EGF treatment. More importantly, we have identified members of the S100 (S100 Calcium Binding Protein) gene family as likely direct targets of EGFR signaling as H3K18ac, H3K27ac and pol2 (RNA polymerase II) increase near the transcription start sites of some of these genes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that S100 proteins, which act as Ca2+ sensors, could play a role in EGF induced tumor cell growth and metastasis, contribute to trastuzumab resistance and cell migration and that they are likely drug targets in HER2+ breast cancer.",BMC Med Genomics,2019,"['Nava M', 'Dutta P', 'Zemke NR', 'Farias-Eisner R', 'Vadgama JV', 'Wu Y']"
30726152,Cell cycle-dependent association of polo kinase Cdc5 with CENP-A contributes to faithful chromosome segregation in budding yeast.,"Evolutionarily conserved polo-like kinase, Cdc5 (Plk1 in humans), associates with kinetochores during mitosis; however, the role of cell cycle-dependent centromeric ( CEN) association of Cdc5 and its substrates that exclusively localize to the kinetochore have not been characterized. Here we report that evolutionarily conserved CEN histone H3 variant, Cse4 (CENP-A in humans), is a substrate of Cdc5, and that the cell cycle-regulated association of Cse4 with Cdc5 is required for cell growth. Cdc5 contributes to Cse4 phosphorylation in vivo and interacts with Cse4 in mitotic cells. Mass spectrometry analysis of in vitro kinase assays showed that Cdc5 phosphorylates nine serine residues clustered within the N-terminus of Cse4. Strains with cse4-9SA exhibit increased errors in chromosome segregation, reduced levels of CEN-associated Mif2 and Mcd1/Scc1 when combined with a deletion of MCM21. Moreover, the loss of Cdc5 from the CEN chromatin contributes to defects in kinetochore integrity and reduction in CEN-associated Cse4. The cell cycle-regulated association of Cdc5 with Cse4 is essential for cell viability as constitutive association of Cdc5 with Cse4 at the kinetochore leads to growth defects. In summary, our results have defined a role for Cdc5-mediated Cse4 phosphorylation in faithful chromosome segregation.",Mol. Biol.

30725455,Integrated Analysis of Acetyl-CoA and Histone Modification via Mass Spectrometry to Investigate Metabolically Driven Acetylation.,"Acetylation is a highly abundant and dynamic post-translational modification (PTM) on histone proteins which, when present on chromatin-bound histones, facilitates the accessibility of DNA for gene transcription. The central metabolite, acetyl-CoA, is a substrate for acetyltransferases, which catalyze protein acetylation. Acetyl-CoA is an essential intermediate in diverse metabolic pathways, and cellular acetyl-CoA levels fluctuate according to extracellular nutrient availability and the metabolic state of the cell. The Michaelis constant (Km) of most histone acetyltransferases (HATs), which specifically target histone proteins, falls within the range of cellular acetyl-CoA concentrations. As a consequence, global levels of histone acetylation are often restricted by availability of acetyl-CoA. Such metabolic regulation of histone acetylation is important for cell proliferation, differentiation, and a variety of cellular functions. In cancer, numerous oncogenic signaling events hijack cellular metabolism, ultimately inducing an extensive rearrangement of the epigenetic state of the cell. Understanding metabolic control of the epigenome through histone acetylation is essential to illuminate the molecular mechanisms by which cells sense, adapt, and occasionally disengage nutrient fluctuations and environmental cues from gene expression. In particular, targeting metabolic regulators or even dietary interventions to impact acetyl-CoA availability and histone acetylation is a promising target in cancer therapy. Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is the most accurate methodology to quantify protein PTMs and metabolites. In this chapter, we present state-of-the-art protocols to analyze histone acetylation and acetyl-CoA. Histones are extracted and digested into short peptides (4-20 aa) prior to LC-MS. Acetyl-CoA is extracted from cells and analyzed using an analogous mass spectrometry-based procedure. Model systems can be fed with isotopically labeled substrates to investigate the metabolic preference for acetyl-CoA production and the metabolic dependence and turnover of histone acetylation. We also present an example of data integration to correlate changes in acetyl-CoA production with histone acetylation.",Methods Mol. Biol.,2019,"['Sidoli S', 'Trefely S', 'Garcia BA', 'Carrer A']"

We demonstrate that H3K9me2-marked nuclear peripheral heterochromatin undergoes lineage-specific reorganization during cell-fate determination. This is associated with spatial repositioning of genomic loci away from the nuclear periphery as shown by 3D immuno-FISH.

However, the underlying cause that induces the dysregulated lncRNAs in cancer remains poorly understood. In the present study, the regulatory model of the lncRNA placenta‑specific protein 2 (PLAC2) upregulation in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) was investigated and its biological functions in OSCC malignant progression was identified. A reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay identified that PLAC2 is upregulated in OSCC cell lines and primary tissue samples. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation verified an enriched histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27) acetylation (H3K27ac) at the promoter region of the PLAC2 gene. Knockdown of cAMP‑response element binding protein‑binding protein (CBP) significantly reduced the enrichment level of H3K27ac, and thereby induced a decreased expression of PLAC2. Functionally, overexpression of PLAC2 promotes OSCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion, whereas knockdown of PLAC2 exerted an opposite effect. Furthermore, the Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway was activated by PLAC2 and mediated the PLAC2‑induced malignant progress of OSCC. In conclusion, the present results indicated that lncRNA PLAC2 is transcriptionally activated by H3K27ac modification at the promoter region in OSCC, and promotes cell growth and metastasis via activating Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway. Therefore, PLAC2 may serve as a promising biomarker for OSCC prognosis and therapy.",Int. J. Oncol.,2019,"['Chen F', 'Qi S', 'Zhang X', 'Wu J', 'Yang X', 'Wang R']"
30718920,Cyclin D1 integrates G9a-mediated histone methylation.,"Lysine methylation of histones and non-histone substrates by the SET domain containing protein lysine methyltransferase (KMT) G9a/EHMT2 governs transcription contributing to apoptosis, aberrant cell growth, and pluripotency. The positioning of chromosomes within the nuclear three-dimensional space involves interactions between nuclear lamina (NL) and the lamina-associated domains (LAD). Contact of individual LADs with the NL are dependent upon H3K9me2 introduced by G9a. The mechanisms governing the recruitment of G9a to distinct subcellular sites, into chromatin or to LAD, is not known. The cyclin D1 gene product encodes the regulatory subunit of the holoenzyme that phosphorylates pRB and NRF1 thereby governing cell-cycle progression and mitochondrial metabolism. Herein, we show that cyclin D1 enhanced H3K9 dimethylation though direct association with G9a. Endogenous cyclin D1 was required for the recruitment of G9a to target genes in chromatin, for G9a-induced H3K9me2 of histones, and for NL-LAD interaction. The finding that cyclin D1 is required for recruitment of G9a to target genes in chromatin and for H3K9 dimethylation, identifies a novel mechanism coordinating protein methylation.",Oncogene,2019,"['Li Z', 'Jiao X', 'Di Sante G', 'Ertel A', 'Casimiro MC', 'Wang M', 'Katiyar S', 'Ju X', 'Klopfenstein DV', 'Tozeren A', 'Dampier W', 'Chepelev I', 'Jeltsch A', 'Pestell RG']"

30699057,PRMT7 methylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α and regulates its role in stress granule formation.,"Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) are a family of enzymes that modify proteins by methylating the guanidino nitrogen atoms of arginine residues to regulate cellular processes such as chromatin remodeling, pre-mRNA splicing, and signal transduction. PRMT7 is the single type III PRMT solely capable of arginine monomethylation. To date, other than histone proteins, there are very few identified substrates of PRMT7. We therefore performed quantitative mass spectrometry experiments to identify PRMT7's interactome and potential substrates to better characterize the enzyme's biological function(s) in cells. These experiments revealed that PRMT7 interacts with and can methylate eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α), in vitro and in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we uncovered a potential regulatory interplay between eIF2α arginine methylation by PRMT7 and stress-induced phosphorylation status of eIF2α at serine 51. Finally, we demonstrated that PRMT7 is required for eIF2α-dependent stress granule formation in the face of various cellular stresses. Altogether, our findings implicate PRMT7 as a novel mediator of eIF2α-dependent cellular stress response pathways.",Mol. Biol.

RNF20/RNF40-mediated monoubiquitination of histone H2B on lysine 120 (H2Bub) has been suggested as a potential mediator of DSB repair, although the nature and function of this posttranslational modification remain enigmatic. In this report, we demonstrate that RNF20 and RNF40 are required for DSB repair leading to homologous recombination (HR) and class switch recombination, a process driven by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), in mouse B cells. These findings suggest a role for RNF20 and RNF40 in DSB repair proximal to NHEJ/HR pathway choice and likely in the signaling of DSBs. We found that DSBs led to a global increase in H2Bub but not the transcription-associated posttranslational modifications H3K4me3 and H3K79me2. We also found that H2AX phosphorylation was dispensable for H2Bub and that ATM and ATR jointly regulate ionizing radiation (IR)-induced H2Bub. Together, our results suggest that RNF20, RNF40, and H2Bub may represent a novel pathway for DSB sensing and repair.",Mol. Cell. Biol.,2019,"['So CC', 'Ramachandran S', 'Martin A']"
30691483,Genetic risk variants for brain disorders are enriched in cortical H3K27ac domains.,"Most variants associated with complex phenotypes in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) do not directly index coding changes affecting protein structure. Instead they are hypothesized to influence gene regulation, with common variants associated with disease being enriched in regulatory domains including enhancers and regions of open chromatin. There is interest, therefore, in using epigenomic annotation data to identify the specific regulatory mechanisms involved and prioritize risk variants. We quantified lysine H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) - a robust mark of active enhancers and promoters that is strongly correlated with gene expression and transcription factor binding - across the genome in entorhinal cortex samples using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by highly parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq). H3K27ac peaks were called using high quality reads combined across all samples and formed the basis of partitioned heritability analysis using LD score regression along with publicly-available GWAS results for seven psychiatric and neurodegenerative traits. Heritability for all seven brain traits was significantly enriched in these H3K27ac peaks (enrichment ranging from 1.09-2.13) compared to regions of the genome containing other active regulatory and functional elements across multiple cell types and tissues. The strongest enrichments were for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (enrichment = 2.19; 95% CI = 2.12-2.27), autism (enrichment = 2.11; 95% CI = 2.05-2.16) and major depressive disorder (enrichment = 2.04; 95% CI = 1.92-2.16). Much lower enrichments were observed for 14 non-brain disorders, although we identified enrichment in cortical H3K27ac domains for body mass index (enrichment = 1.16; 95% CI = 1.13-1.19), ever smoked (enrichment = 2.07; 95% CI = 2.04-2.10), HDL (enrichment = 1.53; 95% CI = 1.45-1.62) and trigylcerides (enrichment = 1.33; 95% CI = 1.24-1.42).

Such epigenetic regulation was controlled by zinc-dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs), one of the major regulators. Due to the therapeutic potential of HDACs as one of the promising drug targets in cancer, HDAC inhibitors have been intensively investigated over the last few decades.

Recently, Chidamide was approved by China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) for the treatment of PTCL. The structural feature of almost all HDAC inhibitors consists of Cap group, linker, and zinc-binding group (ZBG).

30669413,Writing Histone Monoubiquitination in Human Malignancy-The Role of RING Finger E3 Ubiquitin Ligases.,"There is growing evidence highlighting the importance of monoubiquitination as part of the histone code. Monoubiquitination, the covalent attachment of a single ubiquitin molecule at specific lysines of histone tails, has been associated with transcriptional elongation and the DNA damage response. Sites function as scaffolds or docking platforms for proteins involved in transcription or DNA repair; however, not all sites are equal, with some sites resulting in actively transcribed chromatin and others associated with gene silencing. All events are written by E3 ubiquitin ligases, predominantly of the RING (really interesting new gene) finger type. One of the most well-studied events is monoubiquitination of histone H2B at lysine 120 (H2Bub1), written predominantly by the RING finger complex RNF20-RNF40 and generally associated with active transcription. Monoubiquitination of histone H2A at lysine 119 (H2AK119ub1) is also well-studied, its E3 ubiquitin ligase constituting part of thePolycomb Repressor Complex 1 (PRC1), RING1B-BMI1, associated with transcriptional silencing. Both modifications are activated as part of the DNA damage response. Histone monoubiquitination is a key epigenomic event shaping the chromatin landscape of malignancy and influencing how cells respond to DNA damage.

30668640,Inhibition of EHMT1/2 rescues synaptic and cognitive functions for Alzheimer's disease.,"Epigenetic dysregulation, which leads to the alteration of gene expression in the brain, is suggested as one of the key pathophysiological bases of ageing and neurodegeneration. Here we found that, in the late-stage familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mouse model, repressive histone H3 dimethylation at lysine 9 (H3K9me2) and euchromatic histone methyltransferases EHMT1 and EHMT2 were significantly elevated in the prefrontal cortex, a key cognitive region affected in Alzheimer's disease. Elevated levels of H3K9me2 were also detected in the prefrontal cortex region of post-mortem tissues from human patients with Alzheimer's disease. Concomitantly, H3K9me2 at glutamate receptors was increased in prefrontal cortex of aged FAD mice, which was linked to the diminished transcription, expression and function of AMPA and NMDA receptors. Treatment of FAD mice with specific EHMT1/2 inhibitors reversed histone hyper-methylation and led to the recovery of glutamate receptor expression and excitatory synaptic function in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) data indicated that FAD mice exhibited genome-wide increase of H3K9me2 enrichment at genes involved in neuronal signalling (including glutamate receptors), which was reversed by EHMT1/2 inhibition. Moreover, the impaired recognition memory, working memory, and spatial memory in aged FAD mice were rescued by the treatment with EHMT1/2 inhibitors. These results suggest that disrupted epigenetic regulation of glutamate receptor transcription underlies the synaptic and cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease, and targeting histone methylation enzymes may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for this prevalent neurodegenerative disorder.",Brain,2019,"['Zheng Y', 'Liu A', 'Wang ZJ', 'Cao Q', 'Wang W', 'Lin L', 'Ma K', 'Zhang F', 'Wei J', 'Matas E', 'Cheng J', 'Chen GJ', 'Wang X', 'Yan Z']"

Most BC cases are hormone receptor (HR) positive (luminal A or B molecular subtypes) and endocrine treatment (ET) is an important therapeutic modality at all disease stages. Nevertheless, despite substantial improvements in BC patient outcome, effectiveness of ET is limited, as up to 40% of patients eventually relapse or progress and endocrine resistant BC has a less favorable prognosis and constitutes a therapeutic challenge. The biological mechanisms underlying endocrine resistance are, however, still poorly understood. In this review, we focused on data regarding the main epigenetic mechanisms associated with the development of endocrine treated‑resistant BC described so far, including alterations in DNA methylation, non‑coding RNAs, chromatin remodeling, post‑translational histone modifications and histone variants.

30656897,Deregulation of epigenetic mechanisms in cancer.,"Gene expression of both normal and cancer cell is tightly regulated by specific transcription regulators and epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modifications (acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation), nucleosome remodeling and non-coding RNAs. Deregulation of epigenetic mechanisms plays a pivotal role in cancer, although researchers debate if it is a cause or a consequence of oncogenic transformation. Independently from the way in which epigenetic alterations arise in cancer, downstream effects will result in profound changes in transcriptomic and subsequently proteomic profiles. In most cases, changes in expression of epigenetic genes produce functional advantages in cell proliferation, tumor growth and/or migration capacity. Most of epigenetic changes in cancer are triggered by genomic alterations in specific genes that are involved in controlling one of the epigenetic mechanisms. However, there are also mutations in cell metabolism-related genes that affect activities of DNA demethylating enzymes and histone modifiers. Histone modifications are deregulated in cancer mostly due to alterations in genes coding for enzymes that attach or remove histone modifications. Mutations in genes coding for nucleosome remodelers result in aberrant global chromatin organization and facilitate subsequent global alterations of gene copy number or translocations. Recent advancements in next generation sequencing allowed for more precise mapping of global changes in the epigenetic landscape in cancer.",Postepy Biochem.,2018,"['Maleszewska M', 'Wojtas B', 'Kamińska B']"
30638865,LRH1-driven transcription factor circuitry for hepatocyte identity: Super-enhancer cistromic analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The injured liver loses normal function, with concomitant decrease of key identity genes. Super-enhancers contribute to mammalian cell identity. Here, we identified core transcription factors (TFs) that are active in hepatocytes, using genome-wide analysis and hierarchical ordering of super-enhancer distribution.
METHODS: Expression of core TFs was assessed in a cohort of patients with hepatitis or cirrhosis and animal models. Quantitative PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, and hydrodynamic gene delivery methods were used to assess gene regulation and hepatocyte viability. RNA-sequencing data were generated to investigate the role of LRH1 in hepatocyte protection from injury.
RESULTS: Network analysis of super-enhancer-associated gene interactions and expression arrays for cohorts of patients with hepatitis and cirrhosis enabled us to identify a super-enhancer-associated network, and LRH1, HNF4α, PPARα, and RXRα as core TFs. In mouse models, expression of core TFs was robustly inhibited by single and multiple challenge(s) with liver toxicant. RNA-seq analysis revealed changes in expression in the super-enhancer-associated genes sensitively biased toward repression by intoxication. LRH1 gene delivery prevented the loss of hepatic super-enhancer-associated signaling circuitry in toxicant-challenged mice, and protected the liver from injury, indicating the role of LRH1 in hepatocyte identity and viability. In hepatocytes, overexpression of each core TF promoted induction of other TFs.
CONCLUSION: Overall, this study identified LRH1-driven pathway as a circuitry responsible for hepatocyte identity by using cistromic analysis, improving our understanding of liver pathophysiology and identifying novel therapeutic targets.",EBioMedicine,2019,"['Joo MS', 'Koo JH', 'Kim TH', 'Kim YS', 'Kim SG']"
30638745,Pioneer Factor NeuroD1 Rearranges Transcriptional and Epigenetic Profiles to Execute Microglia-Neuron Conversion.,"Minimal sets of transcription factors can directly reprogram somatic cells into neurons. However, epigenetic remodeling during neuronal reprogramming has not been well reconciled with transcriptional regulation. Here we show that NeuroD1 achieves direct neuronal conversion from mouse microglia both in vitro and in vivo. Exogenous NeuroD1 initially occupies closed chromatin regions associated with bivalent trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and H3K27me3 marks in microglia to induce neuronal gene expression. These regions are resolved to a monovalent H3K4me3 mark at later stages of reprogramming to establish the neuronal identity. Furthermore, the transcriptional repressors Scrt1 and Meis2 are induced as NeuroD1 target genes, resulting in a decrease in the expression of microglial genes. In parallel, the microglial epigenetic signature in promoter and enhancer regions is erased. These findings reveal NeuroD1 pioneering activity accompanied by global epigenetic remodeling for two sequential events: onset of neuronal property acquisition and loss of the microglial identity during reprogramming.",Neuron,2019,"['Matsuda T', 'Irie T', 'Katsurabayashi S', 'Hayashi Y', 'Nagai T', 'Hamazaki N', 'Adefuin AMD', 'Miura F', 'Ito T', 'Kimura H', 'Shirahige K', 'Takeda T', 'Iwasaki K', 'Imamura T', 'Nakashima K']"

To date, AF-MSCs differentiation capacity to non-mesodermal lineages and epigenetic regulation are still poorly characterized. The present study investigated the differentiation potential of AF-MSCs toward neural-like cells in comparison to the mesodermal myogenic lineage and assessed epigenetic factors involved in tissue-specific differentiation. Myogenic and neural differentiation assays were performed by the incubation with specific induction media. Typical MSCs markers were determined by flow cytometry, the expression of lineage-specific genes, microRNAs and chromatin modifying proteins were examined by RT-qPCR and Western blot, respectively. AF-MSCs of normal and fetus-affected gestations had similar stem cells characteristics and two-lineage potential, as characterized by cell morphology and the expression of myogenic and neural markers. Two-lineage differentiation process was associated with the down-regulation of miR-17 and miR-21, the up-regulation of miR-34a, miR-146a and DNMT3a/DNMT3b along with the gradual decrease in the levels of DNMT1, HDAC1, active marks of chromatin (H4hyperAc, H3K9ac, H3K4me3) and the repressive H3K9me3 mark. Differentiation was accompanied by the down-regulation of PRC1/2 proteins (BMI1/SUZ12, EZH2) and the retention of the repressive H3K27me3 mark. We report that both AF-MSCs of normal and fetus-affected gestations possess differentiation capacity toward myogenic and neural lineages through rather similar epigenetic mechanisms that may provide potential applications for further investigation of the molecular basis of prenatal diseases and for the future autologous therapy.",Cell Biol.

Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of histones alter compaction of interphase chromatin, but it remains poorly understood how these modifications affect mitotic chromosome stiffness and structure. Using micropipette-based force measurements and epigenetic drugs, we probed the influence of canonical histone PTMs that dictate interphase euchromatin (acetylation) and heterochromatin (methylation) on mitotic chromosome stiffness. By measuring chromosome doubling force (the force required to double chromosome length), we find that histone methylation, but not acetylation, contributes to mitotic structure and stiffness. We discuss our findings in the context of chromatin gel modeling of the large-scale organization of mitotic chromosomes.",Mol. Biol. Cell,2019,"['Biggs R', 'Liu PZ', 'Stephens AD', 'Marko JF']"
30616689,"The histone methyltransferase DOT1L is required for proper DNA damage response, DNA repair, and modulates chemotherapy responsiveness.","BACKGROUND: Disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like (DOT1L) is a non-SET domain containing methyltransferase known to catalyze mono-, di-, and tri-methylation of histone 3 on lysine 79 (H3K79me). DOT1L-mediated H3K79me has been implicated in chromatin-associated functions including gene transcription, heterochromatin formation, and DNA repair. Recent studies have uncovered a role for DOT1L in the initiation and progression of leukemia and other solid tumors. The development and availability of small molecule inhibitors of DOT1L may provide new and unique therapeutic options for certain types or subgroups of cancer.
METHODS: In this study, we examined the role of DOT1L in DNA double-strand break (DSB) response and repair by depleting DOT1L using siRNA or inhibiting its methyltransferase activity using small molecule inhibitors in colorectal cancer cells. Cells were treated with different agents to induce DNA damage in DOT1L-depleted or -inhibited cells and analyzed for DNA repair efficiency and survival. Further, rectal cancer patient samples were analyzed for H3K79me3 levels in order to determine whether it may serve as a potential marker for personalized therapy.
RESULTS: Our results indicate that DOT1L is required for a proper DNA damage response following DNA double-strand breaks by regulating the phosphorylation of the variant histone H2AX (γH2AX) and repair via homologous recombination (HR). Importantly, we show that small molecule inhibitors of DOT1L combined with chemotherapeutic agents that are used to treat colorectal cancers show additive effects. Furthermore, examination of H3K79me3 levels in rectal cancer patients demonstrates that lower levels correlate with a poorer prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we conclude that DOT1L plays an important role in an early DNA damage response and repair of DNA double-strand breaks via the HR pathway. Moreover, DOT1L inhibition leads to increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents and PARP inhibition, which further highlights its potential clinical utility. Our results further suggest that H3K79me3 can be useful as a predictive and or prognostic marker for rectal cancer patients.",Clin Epigenetics,2019,"['Kari V', 'Raul SK', 'Henck JM', 'Kitz J', 'Kramer F', 'Kosinsky RL', 'Übelmesser N', 'Mansour WY', 'Eggert J', 'Spitzner M', 'Najafova Z', 'Bastians H', 'Grade M', 'Gaedcke J', 'Wegwitz F', 'Johnsen SA']"
30616667,Histone H3 lysine K4 methylation and its role in learning and memory.,"Epigenetic modifications such as histone methylation permit change in chromatin structure without accompanying change in the underlying genomic sequence. A number of studies in animal models have shown that dysregulation of various components of the epigenetic machinery causes cognitive deficits at the behavioral level, suggesting that proper epigenetic control is necessary for the fundamental processes of learning and memory. Histone H3 lysine K4 (H3K4) methylation comprises one component of such epigenetic control, and global levels of this mark are increased in the hippocampus during memory formation. Modifiers of H3K4 methylation are needed for memory formation, shown through animal studies, and many of the same modifiers are mutated in human cognitive diseases. Indeed, all of the known H3K4 methyltransferases and four of the known six H3K4 demethylases have been associated with impaired cognition in a neurologic or psychiatric disorder. Cognitive impairment in such patients often manifests as intellectual disability, consistent with a role for H3K4 methylation in learning and memory. As a modification quintessentially, but not exclusively, associated with transcriptional activity, H3K4 methylation provides unique insights into the regulatory complexity of writing, reading, and erasing chromatin marks within an activated neuron. The following review will discuss H3K4 methylation and connect it to transcriptional events required for learning and memory within the developed nervous system. This will include an initial discussion of the most recent advances in the developing methodology to analyze H3K4 methylation, namely mass spectrometry and deep sequencing, as well as how these methods can be applied to more deeply understand the biology of this mark in the brain. We will then introduce the core enzymatic machinery mediating addition and removal of H3K4 methylation marks and the resulting epigenetic signatures of these marks throughout the neuronal genome. We next foray into the brain, discussing changes in H3K4 methylation marks within the hippocampus during memory formation and retrieval, as well as the behavioral correlates of H3K4 methyltransferase deficiency in this region. Finally, we discuss the human cognitive diseases connected to each H3K4 methylation modulator and summarize advances in developing drugs to target them.",Epigenetics Chromatin,2019,"['Collins BE', 'Greer CB', 'Coleman BC', 'Sweatt JD']"
30606913,Epigenetic regulation of beige adipocyte fate by histone methylation.,"Adipose tissue harbors plasticity to adapt to environmental thermal changes. While brown adipocyte is a thermogenic cell which produces heat acutely in response to cold stimuli, beige (or brite) adipocyte is an inducible form of thermogenic adipocytes which emerges in the white adipose depots in response to chronic cold exposure. Such adaptability of adipocytes is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. Among them, histone methylation is chemically stable and thus is an appropriate epigenetic mark for mediating cellular memory to induce and maintain the beige adipocyte characteristics. The enzymes that catalyze the methylation or demethylation of H3K27 and H3K9 regulate brown adipocyte biogenesis through their catalytic activity-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Resolving the bivalency of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 as well as ""opening"" the chromatin structure by demethylation of H3K9 both mediate beige adipogenesis. In addition, it is recently reported that maintenance of beige adipocyte, beige-to-white transition, and cellular memory of prior cold exposure in beige adipocyte are also regulated by histone methylation. A further understanding of the epigenetic mechanism of beige adipocyte biogenesis would unravel the mechanism of the cellular memory of environmental stimuli and provide a novel therapeutics for the metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes that are influenced by environmental factors.",Endocr.

30605533,Epigenetic interplays between DNA demethylation and histone methylation for protecting oncogenesis.,"Epigenetic systems are organized by different types of modifications on histones and DNA. To determine how epigenetic systems can produce variable, yet stable cellular outcomes, understanding the collaboration between these modifications is the key. A recent study by Yamagata and Kobayashi revealed the direct interplay between the regulation of two epigenetic modifications: DNA de-methylation by TET2 and histone H3-K36 methylation. Mechanistically, this finding could explain how cells are protected from oncogenesis by maintaining the integrity of active transcription. The recent identification of epigenetic modifier mutations in leukaemia suggested that it is not just the turning 'on' and 'off' of particular transcriptional events that causes disease occurrence, but rather it is the aberration in epigenetic regulation, i.e. the timing and duration of the activation/inactivation of these transcripts.

30597065,Engagement of DNA and H3K27me3 by the CBX8 chromodomain drives chromatin association.,"Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) is critical for mediating gene repression during development and adult stem cell maintenance. Five CBX proteins, CBX2,4,6,7,8, form mutually exclusive PRC1 complexes and are thought to play a role in the association of PRC1 with chromatin. Specifically, the N-terminal chromodomain (CD) in the CBX proteins is thought to mediate specific targeting to methylated histones. For CBX8, however, the chromodomain has demonstrated weak affinity and specificity for methylated histones in vitro, leaving doubt as to its role in CBX8 chromatin association. Here, we investigate the function of the CBX8 CD in vitro and in vivo. We find that the CD is in fact a major driver of CBX8 chromatin association and determine that this is driven by both histone and previously unrecognized DNA binding activity. We characterize the structural basis of histone and DNA binding and determine how they integrate on multiple levels. Notably, we find that the chromatin environment is critical in determining the ultimate function of the CD in CBX8 association.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2019,"['Connelly KE', 'Weaver TM', 'Alpsoy A', 'Gu BX', 'Musselman CA', 'Dykhuizen EC']"

Re-expression of SMARCB1 in ATRT cell lines enabled confirmation of our genome-wide findings for the chromatin states.

30595380,"PICOT binding to the polycomb group protein, EED, alters H3K27 methylation at the MYT1 PRC2 target gene.","PICOT is a ubiquitous protein that has no functional redundant ortholog and is critical for mouse embryonic development. It is involved in the regulation of signal transduction in T lymphocytes and cardiac muscle, and in cellular iron metabolism and biogenesis of Fe/S proteins. However, very little is known about the physiological role of PICOT and its mechanism of action, and on its upstream regulators or downstream target molecules. In attempt to identify new PICOT interaction partners, we adopted the yeast two-hybrid system and screened a Jurkat T cell cDNA library using the full-length human PICOT cDNA as a bait. We found that PICOT interacts with embryonic ectoderm development (EED), a Polycomb Group (PcG) protein that serves as a core component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and contributes to the regulation of chromatin remodeling and cell differentiation. Using bead immobilized GST-PICOT and GST-EED fusion proteins in a pull-down assay and reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation studies we demonstrated that the interaction between PICOT and EED also occurs in human Jurkat T cells. In addition, immunofluorescence staining of Jurkat T cells revealed partial colocalization of PICOT and EED, predominantly in the cell nuclei. A pull-down assay using the GST-EED fusion protein and lysates of cells expressing different Myc-tagged truncation products of PICOT revealed that binding of EED is mediated by each of the two C-terminal PICOT homology domains and suggests that simultaneous interaction via both domains increases the binding affinity. Furthermore, PICOT knock-down in Jurkat T cells resulted in a reduced histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) at the PRC2 target gene, myelin transcription factor 1 (MYT1), suggesting that PICOT binding to EED alters PRC2-regulated transcriptional repression, and potentially contributes to the epigenetic regulation of chromatin silencing and remodeling.",Biochem.

30592280,"Aldosterone induces renal fibrosis by promoting HDAC1 expression, deacetylating H3K9 and inhibiting klotho transcription.","Aldosterone has an important role in the progression of renal fibrosis. In the present study, the concentration of aldosterone and klotho (KL) in the serum of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) were analyzed. A negative correlation was observed between aldosterone and KL, suggesting that KL may serve a protective role in CKD. Subsequently, an aldosterone‑induced CKD mouse model was established using a single nephrectomy and subcutaneous osmotic pump with aldosterone and 1% high‑salt drinking water. It was demonstrated that fibronectin 1 (Fn1) expression levels were higher in high aldosterone mice, whereas KL expression levels were low. In addition, the results demonstrated that histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) protein expression levels were upregulated in the renal distal convoluted tubules of high aldosterone mice, whereas acetylated H3K9 (H3K9Ac) was significantly downregulated. To determine the transcriptional activation status, chromatin immunoprecipitation polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to validate binding of H3K9Ac to the KL gene promoter site. It was revealed that the binding product of the KL promoter could be PCR‑amplified at the H3K9Ac site from wild‑type and low aldosterone mice; however, amplification of the binding product was not observed in high aldosterone mice. In conclusion, aldosterone significantly inhibited H3K9 acetylation by upregulating HDAC1 protein expression levels in the renal distal convoluted tubule cells, resulting in its inability to bind to the KL promoter, loss of transcription of the KL gene and increased expression of the renal fibrosis gene, Fn1.",Mol Med Rep,2019,"['Lai L', 'Cheng P', 'Yan M', 'Gu Y', 'Xue J']"
30590679,Mitotic phosphorylation of HP1α regulates its cell cycle-dependent chromatin binding.,"Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) is an evolutionarily conserved chromosomal protein that plays a crucial role in heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing. We previously showed that mammalian HP1α is constitutively phosphorylated at its N-terminal serine residues by casein kinase II (CK2), and that this phosphorylation enhances HP1α's binding specificity for nucleosomes containing lysine 9-methylated histone H3 (H3K9me). Although the presence of additional HP1α phosphorylation during mitosis was reported more than a decade ago, its biological significance remains largely elusive. Here we found that mitosis-specific HP1α phosphorylation affected HP1α's ability to bind chromatin. Using biochemical and mutational analyses, we showed that HP1α's mitotic phosphorylation was located in its hinge region and was reversibly regulated by Aurora B kinase and serine/threonine phosphatases. In addition, chromatin fractionation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that hinge region-phosphorylated HP1α was preferentially dissociated from mitotic chromatin and exhibited a reduced DNA-binding activity. Although HP1's mitotic behaviour was previously linked to H3 serine 10 phosphorylation, which blocks the binding of HP1's chromodomain to H3K9me3, our findings suggest that mitotic phosphorylation in HP1α's hinge region also contributes to changes in HP1α's association with mitotic chromatin.",J.

30587243,Identification of novel multi-stage histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors that impair Schistosoma mansoni viability and egg production.,"BACKGROUND: Novel anti-schistosomal multi-stage drugs are needed because only a single drug, praziquantel, is available for the treatment of schistosomiasis and is poorly effective on larval and juvenile stages of the parasite. Schistosomes have a complex life-cycle and multiple developmental stages in the intermediate and definitive hosts. Acetylation and deacetylation of histones play pivotal roles in chromatin structure and in the regulation of transcription in eukaryotic cells. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors modulate acetylation of several other proteins localized both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm and therefore impact on many signaling networks and biological processes. Histone post-translational modifications may provide parasites with the ability to readily adapt to changes in gene expression required for their development and adaptation to the host environment. The aim of the present study was to screen a HDAC class I inhibitor library in order to identify and characterize novel multi-stage hit compounds.
METHODS: We used a high-throughput assay based on the quantitation of ATP in the Schistosoma mansoni larval stage (schistosomula) and screened a library of 1500 class I HDAC inhibitors. Subsequently, a few hits were selected and further characterized by viability assays and phenotypic analyses on adult parasites by carmine red and confocal microscopy.
RESULTS: Three compounds (SmI-124, SmI-148 and SmI-558) that had an effect on the viability of both the schistosomula larval stage and the adult worm were identified. Treatment with sub-lethal doses of SmI-148 and SmI-558 also decreased egg production. Moreover, treatment of adult parasites with SmI-148, and to a lesser extent Sm-124, was associated with histone hyperacetylation. Finally, SmI-148 and SmI-558 treatments of worm pairs caused a phenotype characterized by defects in the parasite reproductive system, with peculiar features in the ovary. In addition, SmI-558 induced oocyte- and vitelline cell-engulfment and signs of degeneration in the uterus and/or oviduct.
CONCLUSIONS: We report the screening of a small HDAC inhibitor library and the identification of three novel compounds which impair viability of the S. mansoni larval stage and adult pairs. These compounds are useful tools for studying deacetylase activity during parasite development and for interfering with egg production.

30587130,Changes in H3K27ac following lipopolysaccharide stimulation of nasopharyngeal epithelial cells.,"BACKGROUND: The epithelium is the first line of defense against pathogens. Notably the epithelial cells lining the respiratory track are crucial in sensing airborne microbes and mounting an effective immune response via the expression of target genes such as cytokines and chemokines. Gene expression regulation following microbial recognition is partly regulated by chromatin re-organization and has been described in immune cells but data from epithelial cells is not as detailed. Here, we report genome-wide changes of the H3K27ac mark, characteristic of activated enhancers and promoters, after stimulation of nasopharyngeal epithelial cells with the bacterial endotoxin Lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
RESULTS: In this study, we have identified 626 regions where the H3K27ac mark showed reproducible increase following LPS induction in epithelial cells. This indicated that sensing of LPS led to opening of the chromatin in our system. Moreover, this phenomenon seemed to happen extensively at enhancers regions and we could observe instances of Super-enhancer formation. As expected, LPS-increased H3K27ac regions were found in the vicinity of genes relevant for LPS response and these changes correlated with up-regulation of their expression. In addition, we found the induction of H3K27ac mark to overlap with the binding of one of the NF-kB members and key regulator of the innate immune response, RELA, following LPS sensing. Indeed, inhibiting the NF-kB pathway abolished the deposition of H3K27ac at the TNF locus, a target of RELA, suggesting that these two phenomena are associated.
CONCLUSIONS: Enhancers' selection and activation following microbial or inflammatory stimuli has been described previously and shown to be mediated via the NF-kB pathway. Here, we demonstrate that this is also likely to occur in the case of LPS-sensing by nasopharyngeal epithelial cells as well. In addition to validating previous findings, we generated a valuable data set relevant to the host immune response to epithelial cell colonizing or infecting pathogens.",BMC Genomics,2018,"['Borghini L', 'Hibberd M', 'Davila S']"
30585724,A Robust Method for the Purification and Characterization of Recombinant Human Histone H1 Variants.,"Higher order compaction of the eukaryotic genome is key to the regulation of all DNA-templated processes, including transcription. This tightly controlled process involves the formation of mononucleosomes, the fundamental unit of chromatin, packaged into higher order architectures in an H1 linker histone-dependent process. While much work has been done to delineate the precise mechanism of this event in vitro and in vivo, major gaps still exist, primarily due to a lack of molecular tools. Specifically, there has never been a successful purification and biochemical characterization of all human H1 variants. Here we present a robust method to purify H1 and illustrate its utility in the purification of all somatic variants and one germline variant.

Using immunohistochemistry, pyrosequencing, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), decitabine (DAC)/4-phenylbutyricacid (PBA) treatment and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we found the low expression of VIPR1 was correlated with poor histological differentiation and poor survival. The promoter region of VIPR1 was methylated and DNA methylation inhibited VIPR1 gene transcription. Deacetylation of H3K27 in the promoter of VIPR1 inhibited the transcription of VIPR1 in HCC.

30582583,Purification of H3 and H4 Histone Proteins and the Quantification of Acetylated Histone Marks in Cells and Brain Tissue.,"In all eukaryotic organisms, chromatin, the physiological template of all genetic information, is essential for heredity. Chromatin is subject to an array of diverse posttranslational modifications (PTMs) that mostly occur in the amino termini of histone proteins (i.e., histone tail) and regulate the accessibility and functional state of the underlying DNA. Histone tails extend from the core of the nucleosome and are subject to the addition of acetyl groups by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and the removal of acetyl groups by histone deacetylases (HDACs) during cellular growth and differentiation. Specific acetylation patterns on lysine (K) residues on histone tails determine a dynamic homeostasis between transcriptionally active or transcriptionally repressed chromatin by (1) influencing the core histone assembly and (2) recruiting synergistic or antagonistic chromatin-associated proteins to the transcription site. The fundamental regulatory mechanism of the complex nature of histone tail PTMs influences the majority of chromatin-templated processes and results in changes in cell maturation and differentiation in both normal and pathological development. The goal of the current report is to provide novices with an efficient method to purify core histone proteins from cells and brain tissue and to reliably quantify acetylation marks on histones H3 and H4.",J Vis Exp,2018,"['Janczura KJ', 'Volmar CH', 'Wahlestedt C']"

Approach and Results- ZFP148 mRNA expression increased at day 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 after during abdominal aortic aneurysm formation in C57BL/6 mice. Loss of ZFP148 conferred abdominal aortic aneurysm protection using ERTCre+ ZFP148 flx/flx mice. In a third set of experiments, smooth muscle-specific loss of ZFP148 alleles resulted in progressively greater protection using novel transgenic mice (MYH [myosin heavy chain 11] Cre+ flx/flx, flx/wt, and wt/wt). Elastin degradation, LGAL3, and neutrophil staining were significantly attenuated, while α-actin staining was increased in ZFP148 knockout mice. Results were verified in total cell ZFP148 and smooth muscle-specific knockout mice using an angiotensin II model. ZFP148 smooth muscle-specific conditional mice demonstrated increased proliferation and ZFP148 was shown to bind to the p21 promoter during abdominal aortic aneurysm formation. ZFP148 smooth muscle-specific conditional knockout mice also demonstrated decreased apoptosis as measured by decreased cleaved caspase-3 staining. ZFP148 bound smooth muscle marker genes via chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis mediated by NF-1 (neurofibromin 1) promote histone H3K4 deacetylation via histone deacetylase 5. Transient transfections and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that NF-1 was required for ZFP148 protein binding to smooth muscle marker genes promoters during aneurysm formation. Elimination of NF-1 using shRNA approaches demonstrated that NF-1 is required for binding and elimination of NF-1 increased BRG1 recruitment, the ATPase subunit of the SWI/SWF complex, and increased histone acetylation. Conclusions- ZFP148 plays a critical role in multiple murine models of aneurysm formation. These results suggest that ZFP148 is important in the regulation of proliferation, smooth muscle gene downregulation, and apoptosis in aneurysm development.",Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

30574830,Identification and epigenetic analysis of divergent long non-coding RNAs in multilineage differentiation of human Neural Progenitor Cells.,"Long non-coding RNAs have emerged as an important regulatory layer in biological systems. Of the various types of lncRNAs, one class (designated as divergent RNAs/XH), which is in head-to-head overlap with the coding genes, has emerged as a critical biotype that regulates development and cellular differentiation. This work aimed to analyze previously published data on differential expression, epigenetic and network analysis in order to demonstrate the association of divergent lncRNAs, a specific biotype with the differentiation of human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs). We have analyzed various available RNAseq databases that address the neuronal and astrocytic differentiation of hNPCs and identified differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs) during cell-fate determination. Key DELs identified from the databases were experimentally verified by us in our in-vitro hNPC differentiation system. We also analyzed the change in promoter activity using ChIP-seq datasets of the histone markers H3K4me3 (activation) and H3K27me3 (inactivation) of these DELs. Additionally, we explored the change in the euchromatinization state of DELs (by analyzing DNase-seq data) during lineage-specific differentiation of hNPCs and performed their network analysis. We were able to identify differences between neuronal and astrocytic differentiation of hNPCs at the level of divergent DELs epigenetic markers, DNAase hypersensitive sites and gene expression network. Divergent lncRNAs are more involved in neuronal rather than astrocytic differentiation, while the sense downstream lncRNA biotype appears to be more involved in astrocytic differentiation. By studying the lncRNA involvement of distinct biotypes, we have been able to indicate the preferential role of a particular biotype during lineage-specific differentiation.",RNA Biol,2019,"['Prajapati B', 'Fatma M', 'Maddhesiya P', 'Sodhi MK', 'Fatima M', 'Dargar T', 'Bhagat R', 'Seth P', 'Sinha S']"
30572012,Dynamic regulation of epigenetic demethylation by oxygen availability and cellular redox.,"The chromatin structure of the mammalian genome must facilitate both precisely-controlled DNA replication together with tightly-regulated gene transcription. This necessarily involves complex mechanisms and processes which remain poorly understood. It has long been recognised that the epigenetic landscape becomes established during embryonic development and acts to specify and determine cell fate. In addition, the chromatin structure is highly dynamic and allows for both cellular reprogramming and homeostatic modulation of cell function. In this respect, the functions of epigenetic ""erasers"", which act to remove covalently-linked epigenetic modifications from DNA and histones are critical. The enzymatic activities of the TET and JmjC protein families have been identified as demethylases which act to remove methyl groups from DNA and histones, respectively. Further, they are characterised as members of the Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase superfamily. This provides the intriguing possibility that their enzymatic activities may be modulated by cellular metabolism, oxygen availability and redox-based mechanisms, all of which are likely to display dynamic cell- and tissue-specific patterns of flux.

This leads to the establishment of specific transcriptional gene programs which adapt to environmental stimuli. On the other hand, recent advances suggest that metabolic pathways could directly signal into chromatin modifications and impact on specific gene programs. The key metabolites acetyl-CoA or S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) are examples of important metabolic hubs which play in addition a role in chromatin acetylation and methylation.

30563893,Early Loss of Histone H2B Monoubiquitylation Alters Chromatin Accessibility and Activates Key Immune Pathways That Facilitate Progression of Ovarian Cancer.,"Recent insights supporting the fallopian tube epithelium (FTE) and serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STIC) as the tissue of origin and the precursor lesion, respectively, for the majority of high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOC) provide the necessary context to study the mechanisms that drive the development and progression of HGSOC. Here, we investigate the role of the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF20 and histone H2B monoubiquitylation (H2Bub1) in serous tumorigenesis and report that heterozygous loss of RNF20 defines the majority of HGSOC tumors. At the protein level, H2Bub1 was lost or downregulated in a large proportion of STIC and invasive HGSOC tumors, implicating RNF20/H2Bub1 loss as an early event in the development of serous ovarian carcinoma. Knockdown of RNF20, with concomitant loss of H2Bub1, was sufficient to enhance cell migration and clonogenic growth of FTE cells. To investigate the mechanisms underlying these effects, we performed ATAC-seq and RNA-seq in RNF20 knockdown FTE cell lines. Loss of RNF20 and H2Bub1 was associated with a more open chromatin conformation, leading to upregulation of immune signaling pathways, including IL6. IL6 was one of the key cytokines significantly upregulated in RNF20- and H2Bub1-depleted FTE cells and imparted upon these cells an enhanced migratory phenotype. These studies provide mechanistic insight into the observed oncogenic phenotypes triggered by the early loss of H2Bub1. SIGNIFICANCE: Loss of RNF20 and H2Bub1 contributes to transformation of the fallopian tube epithelium and plays a role in the initiation and progression of high-grade serous ovarian cancer.",Cancer Res.,2019,"['Hooda J', 'Novak M', 'Salomon MP', 'Matsuba C', 'Ramos RI', 'MacDuffie E', 'Song M', 'Hirsch MS', 'Lester J', 'Parkash V', 'Karlan BY', 'Oren M', 'Hoon DS', 'Drapkin R']"
30559478,Epigenome-wide study uncovers large-scale changes in histone acetylation driven by tau pathology in aging and Alzheimer's human brains.,"Accumulation of tau and amyloid-β are two pathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study using the histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) mark in 669 aged human prefrontal cortices; in contrast with amyloid-β, tau protein burden had a broad effect on the epigenome, affecting 5,990 of 26,384 H3K9ac domains. Tau-related alterations aggregated in large genomic segments reflecting spatial chromatin organization, and the magnitude of these effects correlated with the segment's nuclear lamina association. Functional relevance of these chromatin changes was demonstrated by (1) consistent transcriptional changes in three independent datasets and (2) similar findings in two mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we found that tau overexpression in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons altered chromatin structure and that these effects could be blocked by a small molecule predicted to reverse the tau effect. Thus, we report broad tau-driven chromatin rearrangements in the aging human brain that may be reversible with heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitors.",Nat.

30540930,SIRT7-Dependent Deacetylation of Fibrillarin Controls Histone H2A Methylation and rRNA Synthesis during the Cell Cycle.,"Fibrillarin (FBL) is a dual-function nucleolar protein that catalyzes 2'-O methylation of pre-rRNA and methylation of histone H2A at glutamine 104 (H2AQ104me). The mechanisms that regulate FBL activity are unexplored. Here, we show that FBL is acetylated at several lysine residues by the acetyltransferase CBP and deacetylated by SIRT7. While reversible acetylation does not impact FBL-mediated pre-rRNA methylation, hyperacetylation impairs the interaction of FBL with histone H2A and chromatin, thereby compromising H2AQ104 methylation (H2AQ104me) and rDNA transcription. SIRT7-dependent deacetylation of FBL ensures H2AQ104me and high levels of rRNA synthesis during interphase. At the onset of mitosis, nucleolar disassembly is accompanied by hyperacetylation of FBL, loss of H2AQ104me, and repression of polymerase I (Pol I) transcription. Overexpression of an acetylation-deficient, but not an acetylation-mimicking, FBL mutant restores H2AQ104me and transcriptional activity. The results reveal that SIRT7-dependent deacetylation impacts nucleolar activity by an FBL-driven circuitry that mediates cell-cycle-dependent fluctuation of rDNA transcription.",Cell Rep,2018,"['Iyer-Bierhoff A', 'Krogh N', 'Tessarz P', 'Ruppert T', 'Nielsen H', 'Grummt I']"
30539410,Interfering with bromodomain epigenome readers as therapeutic option in mucoepidermoid carcinoma.,"PURPOSE: Emerging evidence indicates that bromodomains comprise a conserved class of epigenome readers involved in cancer development and inflammation. Bromodomains are associated with epigenetic modifications of gene transcription through interactions with lysine residues of histone tails. Particularly, the bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family member BRD4 has been found to be involved in the control over oncogenes, including c-MYC, and in the maintenance of downstream inflammatory processes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of pharmacologically displacing BRD4 in mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) cells.
METHODS: We assessed the presence of BRD4 levels in a panel of human MEC tissue samples in conjunction with histological grading and clinical information. In vitro studies were carried out using human MEC-derived cell lines. The BET inhibitor iBET762 was administered to MEC cells to assess the impact of disrupted BRD4 signaling on colony forming capacities and cell cycle status. The activation of cellular senescence induced by iBET762 was determined by immunohistochemical staining for p16
RESULTS: We found that primary human MECs and MEC-derived cell lines are endowed with high BRD4 expression levels compared to those in normal salivary glands. We also found that, by displacing BRD4 from chromatin using the BET inhibitor iBET762, MEC cells lose their colony forming capacities and undergo G1 cell cycle arrest and senescence. Finally, we found that targeted displacement of BRD4 from chromatin results in depletion of cancer stem cells from the overall MEC cell populations.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that bromodomain-mediated gene regulation constitutes an epigenetic mechanism that is deregulated in MEC cells and that the use of BET inhibitors may serve as a feasible therapeutic strategy to manage MECs.",Cell Oncol (Dordr),2019,"['Markman RL', 'Webber LP', 'Nascimento Filho CHV', 'Reis LA', 'Vargas PA', 'Lopes MA', 'Zanella V', 'Martins MD', 'Squarize CH', 'Castilho RM']"
30532068,A chromatin integration labelling method enables epigenomic profiling with lower input.,"Chromatin plays a crucial role in gene regulation, and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) has been the standard technique for examining protein-DNA interactions across the whole genome. However, it is difficult to obtain epigenomic information from limited numbers of cells by ChIP-seq because of sample loss during chromatin preparation and inefficient immunoprecipitation. In this study, we established an immunoprecipitation-free epigenomic profiling method named chromatin integration labelling (ChIL), which enables the amplification of genomic sequences closely associated with the target molecules before cell lysis. Using ChIL followed by sequencing (ChIL-seq), we reliably detected the distributions of histone modifications and DNA-binding factors in 100-1,000 cells. In addition, ChIL-seq successfully detected genomic regions associated with histone marks at the single-cell level. Thus, ChIL-seq offers an alternative method to ChIP-seq for epigenomic profiling using small numbers of cells, in particular, those attached to culture plates and after immunofluorescence.",Nat.

Despite being an important diagnostic marker for this hard-to-treat malignancy, the mechanisms of aberrant SOX11 expression are largely unknown. Herein, we describe 2 modes of SOX11 regulation by the cell-cycle regulator cyclin D1 (CCND1) and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). We found that ectopic expression of CCND1 in multiple human MCL cell lines resulted in increased SOX11 transcription, which correlated with increased acetylated histones H3K9 and H3K14 (H3K9/14Ac). Increased H3K9/14Ac and SOX11 expression was also observed after histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) or HDAC2 was depleted by RNA interference or inhibited by the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat.

30529301,PARP1-LSD1 functional interplay controls transcription of SOD2 that protects human pro-inflammatory macrophages from death under an oxidative condition.,"The function of macrophages makes them vulnerable to several sources of stress and damage, and thus there is a considerable requirement for some form of resilient molecular defence. Differentiation of human macrophages and their further pro-inflammatory (M1) polarization with bacterial endotoxin is associated with increased transcription of PARP1 and SOD2. The latter gene responded immediately to LPS with high NFκB-dependent expression rate, and the resulting enzyme made M1 macrophages resistant to hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress and associated cell death. LPS-induced recruitment of RELA to SOD2 promoter was accompanied by release of PARP1 and LSD1 from chromatin and increased H3K4 di- and tri-methylation. PARP1 dissociation from SOD2 promoter occurred at an early stage of SOD2 transcriptional activation. This event contributed to the termination of mRNA synthesis at a later stage of macrophage polarization by allowing LSD1 to rebind to the SOD2 promoter. LSD1 removed transcription-promoting methylation of H3K4 and led to displacement of RELA. Analysis of temporal changes at the SOD2 promoter indicated a direct mutual interdependence between PARP1, LSD1, H3K4 methylation and the ongoing SOD2 transcription, which correlated positively with both PARP1 abundance on the chromatin and dimethylation of H3K4, but negatively with LSD1 and chromatin compaction in LPS-treated macrophages. Deficiency of LSD1 activity and maintenance of PARP1 at the SOD2 promoter substantially upregulated SOD2 level, thereby further increasing resistance of M1 macrophages to hydrogen peroxide. Inhibitors of LSD1 and PARP1 poisons that capture the latter enzyme on the chromatin seem to be prosurvival molecular tools protecting polarized macrophages from certain pro-oxidative conditions.",Free Radic.

However, the epigenetic mechanism that accounts for hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation in liver fibrosis remains largely unknown.
METHODS: Primary HSCs were used to screen the differentially expressed histone H3 lysine methyltransferases and demethylases during HSC activation. Loss-of-function experiments were applied to determine the cellular functions of KDM4D in HSCs. Transcriptome analysis was applied to explore the downstream targets of KDM4D. Real-time qPCR, western blotting, immunohistochemical staining, and chromatin immunoprecipitation were performed to uncover the underlying mechanism concerning KDM4D during liver fibrogenesis.
FINDINGS: KDM4D was identified as a remarkable up-regulated histone H3 demethylase during HSC activation. The overexpression profile of KDM4D was confirmed in three fibrosis animal models and human fibrotic liver tissues. In vitro Kdm4d knockdown impaired the collagen gel contraction and migration capacity of primary HSCs. In established CCl

30508113,The OTUD5-UBR5 complex regulates FACT-mediated transcription at damaged chromatin.,"Timely stalling and resumption of RNA polymerases at damaged chromatin are actively regulated processes. Prior work showed an importance of FACT histone chaperone in such process. Here we provide a new role of OTUD5 deubiquitinase in the FACT-dependent process. Through a DUB RNAi screen, we found OTUD5 as a specific stabilizer of the UBR5 E3 ligase. OTUD5 localizes to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), interacts with UBR5 and represses the RNA Pol II elongation and RNA synthesis. OTUD5 co-localizes and interacts with the FACT component SPT16 and antagonizes the histone H2A deposition at DSB lesions. OTUD5 interacts with UBR5 and SPT16 independently through two distinct regions, and both interactions are necessary for arresting the Pol II elongation at lesions. These analyses suggested that the catalytic (through UBR5 stabilization) as well as scaffolding (through FACT binding) activities of OTUD5 are involved in the FACT-dependent transcription. We found that a cancer-associated missense mutation within the OTUD5 Ubiquitin Interacting Motif (UIM) abrogates the FACT association and the Pol II arrest, providing a possible link between the transcriptional regulation and tumor suppression. Our work establishes OTUD5 as a new regulator of the DNA damage response, and provides an insight into the FACT-dependent transcription at damaged chromatin.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2019,"['de Vivo A', 'Sanchez A', 'Yegres J', 'Kim J', 'Emly S', 'Kee Y']"
30507159,Molecular Mechanism of the Pin1-Histone H1 Interaction.,"Pin1 is an essential peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) that catalyzes cis-trans prolyl isomerization in proteins containing pSer/Thr-Pro motifs. It has an N-terminal WW domain that targets these motifs and a C-terminal PPIase domain that catalyzes isomerization. Recently, Pin1 was shown to modify the conformation of phosphorylated histone H1 and stabilize the chromatin-H1 interaction by increasing its residence time. This Pin1-histone H1 interaction plays a key role in pathogen response, in infection, and in cell cycle control; therefore, anti-Pin1 therapeutics are an important focus for treating infections as well as cancer. Each of the H1 histones (H1.0-H1.5) contains several potential Pin1 recognition pSer/pThr-Pro motifs. To understand the Pin1-histone H1 interaction fully, we investigated how both the isolated WW domain and full-length Pin1 interact with three H1 histone substrate peptide sequences that were previously identified as important binding partners (H1.1, H1.4, and H1.5).

Gene control through enhancer activity is often dominated by a subset of lineage-specific transcription factors. By integrating measures of chromatin accessibility and enrichment for H3K27 acetylation, we have generated regulatory landscapes of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) samples and representative cell lines. With super enhancer-based modeling of regulatory circuits and assessments of transcription factor dependencies, we discover that the essential super enhancer factor PAX5 dominates CLL regulatory nodes and is essential for CLL cell survival.

30516086,Destabilization of the MiniChromosome Maintenance (MCM) complex modulates the cellular response to DNA double strand breaks.,"DNA replication during S phase involves thousands of replication forks that must be coordinated to ensure that every DNA section is replicated only once. The minichromosome maintenance proteins, MCM2 to MCM7, form a heteromeric DNA helicase required for both the initiation and elongation of DNA replication. Although only two DNA helicase activities are necessary to establish a bidirectional replication fork from each replication origin, a large excess of MCM complexes is amassed and distributed along the chromatin. The function of the additional MCM complexes is not well understood, as most are displaced from the DNA during the S-phase, apparently without playing an active role in DNA replication. DNA damage response (DDR) kinases activated by stalled forks prevent the replication machinery from being activated, indicating a tight relationship between DDR and DNA replication. To investigate the role of MCM proteins in the cellular response to DNA damage, we used shRNA targeting MCM2 or MCM3 to determine the impact of a reduction in MCM complex. The alteration of MCM proteins induced a change in the activation of key factors of the DDR in response to Etoposide treatment. Etoposide-induced DNA damage affected the phosphorylation of γ-H2AX, CHK1 and CHK2 without affecting cell viability. Using assays measuring homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), we identified a decrease in both HR and NHEJ associated with a decrease in MCM complex.",Cell Cycle,2018,"['Drissi R', 'Chauvin A', 'McKenna A', 'Lévesque D', 'Blais-Brochu S', 'Jean D', 'Boisvert FM']"

The recent finding, that macroH2A1 regulates mitochondrial respiration by globally dampening PARP activity, requires the field to re-evaluate which functions of macroH2A1 are due to global effects on cellular metabolism and which are direct effects determined by macroH2A1 chromatin localization. Here, we demonstrate macroH2A1 incorporation into H2B-acetylated chromatin requires a feature in its histone-fold domain, distinguishing this process from incorporation into H3K27me3-containing chromatin in which multiple features of macroH2A1 are sufficient for targeting. In addition, we identify H2BK20 acetylation as a critical modification required to target macroH2A1 to H2B-acetylated chromatin.

30496042,Interaction of positive coactivator 4 with histone 3.3 protein is essential for transcriptional activation of the luteinizing hormone receptor gene.,"The luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) is essential for sexual development and reproduction in mammals. We have established that Sp1 has a central role in derepression of LHR gene transcription induced by Trichostatin A (TSA) in MCF7 cells. Moreover, the co-activator PC4 which associates directly with Sp1 at the LHR promoter is essential for TSA-mediated LHR transcription. This study explores interactions of PC4 with histone proteins, which presumably triggers chromatin modifications during LHR transcriptional activation. TSA treatment of MCF7 cells expressing PC4-Flag protein induces acetylation of histone 3 (H3) and immunoprecipitation (IP) studies revealed its interaction with PC4-Flag protein. MS/MS analysis of the protein complex obtained after IP from TSA treated samples detected H3.3 acetylated at K9, K14, K18, K23 and K27 as a PC4 interacting protein. The association of PC4 with H3.3 was corroborated by IP and re-ChIP using H3.3 antibody. Similarly, IP and re-ChIP showed association of PC4 with H3 acetylated protein. Knockdown of PC4 in MCF7 cells reduced H3.3 enrichment, H3 acetylation at the Lys sites and LHR promoter activity in TSA treated cells despite an increase in H3 and H3.3 protein induced by TSA, linking PC4 to H3 acetylation and LHR transcription. Depletion of H3.3 A/B in MCF7 cells impair chromatin accessibility and enrichment of Pol II and TFIIB at the LHR promoter and its activation, resulting in marked reduction of LHR gene expression. Together, these findings point to the critical role of PC4 and its association with acetylated H3.3 in TSA-induced LHR gene transcription.",Biochim Biophys Acta Gene Regul Mech,2018,"['Zhao P', 'Kavarthapu R', 'Anbazhagan R', 'Liao M', 'Dufau ML']"

It remains unclear how epigenetic histone modifications, despite their crucial roles in regulating chromatin architectures, are dynamically coordinated with chromatin reorganization in controlling this process. We have developed and characterized biosensors with high sensitivity and specificity based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). These biosensors were incorporated into nucleosomes to visualize histone H3 Lys-9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and histone H3 Ser-10 phosphorylation (H3S10p) simultaneously in the same live cell. We observed an anticorrelated coupling in time between H3K9me3 and H3S10p in a single live cell during mitosis. A transient increase of H3S10p during mitosis is accompanied by a decrease of H3K9me3 that recovers before the restoration of H3S10p upon mitotic exit. We further showed that H3S10p is causatively critical for the decrease of H3K9me3 and the consequent reduction of heterochromatin structure, leading to the subsequent global chromatin reorganization and nuclear envelope dissolution as a cell enters mitosis.

JMJD2D knockdown reduced CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as growth of xenograft tumors and formation of metastases in mice. JMJD2D was required for expression of β-catenin in CRC cell lines; ectopic expression of JMJD2D increased the promoter activities of genes regulated by β-catenin (MYC, CCND1, MMP2, and MMP9). We found that JMJD2D and β-catenin interacted physically and that JMJD2D demethylated H3K9me3 at promoters of β-catenin target genes. JMJD2D-knockout mice developed fewer colitis-associated colorectal tumors than control mice, and their tumor tissues had lower levels of β-catenin, MYC, cyclin D1, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen than tumors from control mice.

CONCLUSIONS: Levels of the histone demethylase JMJD2D are increased in human colorectal tumors compared with nontumor colon tissues. JMJD2D interacts with β-catenin to activate transcription of its target genes and promote CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as formation of colorectal tumors in mice.",Gastroenterology,2019,"['Peng K', 'Kou L', 'Yu L', 'Bai C', 'Li M', 'Mo P', 'Li W', 'Yu C']"
30472189,Nucleosome Turnover Regulates Histone Methylation Patterns over the Genome.,"Recent studies have indicated that nucleosome turnover is rapid, occurring several times per cell cycle. To access the effect of nucleosome turnover on the epigenetic landscape, we investigated H3K79 methylation, which is produced by a single methyltransferase (Dot1l) with no known demethylase. Using chemical-induced proximity (CIP), we find that the valency of H3K79 methylation (mono-, di-, and tri-) is determined by nucleosome turnover rates. Furthermore, propagation of this mark is predicted by nucleosome turnover simulations over the genome and accounts for the asymmetric distribution of H3K79me toward the transcriptional unit. More broadly, a meta-analysis of other conserved histone modifications demonstrates that nucleosome turnover models predict both valency and chromosomal propagation of methylation marks. Based on data from worms, flies, and mice, we propose that the turnover of modified nucleosomes is a general means of propagation of epigenetic marks and a determinant of methylation valence.",Mol.

30466565,Extracellular traps in kidney disease.,"During the past decade the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) has been recognized as a unique modality of pathogen fixation (sticky extracellular chromatin) and pathogen killing (cytotoxic histones and proteases) during host defense, as well as collateral tissue damage. Numerous other triggers induce NET formation in multiple forms of sterile inflammation, including thrombosis, gout, obstruction of draining ducts, and trauma. Whether neutrophils always die along with NET release, and if they do die, how, remains under study and is most likely context dependent. In certain settings, neutrophils release NETs while undergoing regulated necrosis-for example, necroptosis. NETs and extracellular traps (ETs) released by macrophages also have been well documented in kidney diseases-for example, in various forms of acute kidney injury. Histones released from ETs and other sources are cytotoxic and elicit inflammation, contributing to necroinflammation of the early-injury phase of acute tubular necrosis in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-related renal vasculitis, anti-glomerular basement membrane disease, lupus nephritis, and thrombotic microangiopathies. Finally, acute kidney injury-related releases of dying renal cells or ETs promote remote organ injuries-for example, acute respiratory distress syndrome. In this review, we summarize what is known about the release of ETs from neutrophils and macrophages in the kidney, the available experimental evidence, and ongoing discussions in the field.",Kidney Int.,2018,"['Nakazawa D', 'Marschner JA', 'Platen L', 'Anders HJ']"

30466474,Tackling malignant melanoma epigenetically: histone lysine methylation.,"Post-translational histone modifications such as acetylation and methylation can affect gene expression. Histone acetylation is commonly associated with activation of gene expression whereas histone methylation is linked to either activation or repression of gene expression. Depending on the site of histone modification, several histone marks can be present throughout the genome. A combination of these histone marks can shape global chromatin architecture, and changes in patterns of marks can affect the transcriptomic landscape. Alterations in several histone marks are associated with different types of cancers, and these alterations are distinct from marks found in original normal tissues. Therefore, it is hypothesized that patterns of histone marks can change during the process of tumorigenesis.This review focuses on histone methylation changes (both removal and addition of methyl groups) in malignant melanoma, a deadly skin cancer, and the implications of specific inhibitors of these modifications as a combinatorial therapeutic approach.",Clin Epigenetics,2018,"['Orouji E', 'Utikal J']"

We used herpes simplex virus with bioorthogonally labeled genomes to detect host factors recruited to viral DNA shortly after its nuclear entry and found that the cellular IFI16, PML, and ATRX proteins colocalized with viral DNA by 15 min post infection. HSV-1 infection of ATRX-depleted fibroblasts resulted in elevated viral mRNA and accelerated viral DNA accumulation. Despite the early association of ATRX with vDNA, we found that initial viral heterochromatin formation is ATRX-independent. However, viral heterochromatin stability required ATRX from 4 to 8 hr post infection. Inhibition of transcription blocked viral chromatin loss in ATRX-knockout cells; thus, ATRX is uniquely required for heterochromatin maintenance during chromatin stress. These results argue that the initial formation and the subsequent maintenance of viral heterochromatin are separable mechanisms, a concept that likely extrapolates to host cell chromatin and viral latency.",Elife,2018,"['Cabral JM', 'Oh HS', 'Knipe DM']"

Integrative molecular subtyping of the five data streams revealed three major subtypes of which two were clearly TMPRSS2-ERG dictated. Importantly, we identify a third subtype with low chromatin binding and activity of AR, but with high activity of FGF and WNT signaling. While positive for neuroendocrine-hallmark genes, these tumors were copy number-neutral with low mutational burden, significantly depleted for genes characteristic of poor-outcome associated luminal B-subtype.

Previous studies pointed to a functional link between immunomodulation, histamine production, and folate metabolism, the central 1-carbon pathway for the transfer of methyl groups. Using mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy, we analyzed folate metabolites of L. reuteri strain 6475 and discovered that the bacterium produces a 2-carbon-transporting folate in the form of 5,10-ethenyl-tetrahydrofolyl polyglutamate. Isotopic labeling permitted us to trace the source of the 2-carbon unit back to acetate of the culture medium. We show that the 2C folate cycle of L. reuteri is capable of transferring 2 carbon atoms to homocysteine to generate the unconventional amino acid ethionine, a known immunomodulator. When we treated monocytic THP-1 cells with ethionine, their transcription of TNF-α was inhibited and cell proliferation reduced. Mass spectrometry of THP-1 histones revealed incorporation of ethionine instead of methionine into proteins, a reduction of histone-methylation, and ethylation of histone lysine residues. Our findings suggest that the microbiome can expose the host to ethionine through a novel 2-carbon transporting variant of the folate cycle and modify human chromatin via ethylation.-Röth, D., Chiang, A.

The chemical modifications of histones and DNA caused by the regulated activity of chromatin-modifying enzymes such as Polycomb help establish and maintain such expression patterns. Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is the only known methyltransferase specific for histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) and catalyzes its trimethylation leading to the repressive H3K27me3 mark. Structural biology has made important contributions to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that ensure the spatiotemporal regulation of PRC2 activity and the establishment of inactive chromatin domains marked by H3K27me3. In this review, we discuss the recent structural studies that have advanced our understanding of PRC2 function, in particular the roles of intersubunit interactions in complex assembly and the regulation of methyltransferase activity, as well as the mechanism of local H3K27me3 spreading leading to repressive domains.",Biochemistry,2019,"['Kasinath V', 'Poepsel S', 'Nogales E']"

While these lncRNAs are generally short lived, length restricted, and non-polyadenylated, how their expression is distinguished from protein-coding genes remains enigmatic. Surprisingly, depletion of the ubiquitous Pol-II-associated transcription elongation factor SPT6 promotes a redistribution of H3K36me3 histone marks from active protein coding to lncRNA genes, which correlates with increased lncRNA transcription. SPT6 knockdown also impairs the recruitment of the Integrator complex to chromatin, which results in a transcriptional termination defect for lncRNA genes. This leads to the formation of extended, polyadenylated lncRNAs that are both chromatin restricted and form increased levels of RNA:DNA hybrid (R-loops) that are associated with DNA damage. Additionally, these deregulated lncRNAs overlap with DNA replication origins leading to localized DNA replication stress and a cellular senescence phenotype. Overall, our results underline the importance of restricting lncRNA expression.",Mol.

30446899,Functional relevance of genes predicted to be affected by epigenetic alterations in atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors.,"PURPOSE: Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) is a highly malignant brain tumor predominantly arising in infants. Mutations of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex members SMARCB1/INI1 or (rarely) SMARCA4/Brg1 are the sole recurrent genetic lesions. Epigenetic studies revealed a large number of genes predicted to be affected by differential histone modifications in ATRT, but the role of these genes in the biology of ATRT remains uncertain. We therefore aimed at exploring the role of these genes in the detrimental effects of SMARCB1-deficiency.
METHODS: The functional relevance of 1083 genes predicted to be affected by epigenetic alterations in ATRT was examined in vivo using a Drosophila melanogaster model of SMARCB1-deficiency. Human orthologues of genes whose knockdown modified the phenotype in the Gal4-UAS fly model were further examined in ATRT samples and SMARCB1-deficient rhabdoid tumor cells.
RESULTS: Knockdown of Snr1, the fly orthologue of SMARCB1, resulted in a lethal phenotype and epigenetic alterations in the fly model. The lethal phenotype was shifted to later stages of development upon additional siRNA knockdown of 89 of 1083 genes screened in vivo. These included TGF-beta receptor signaling pathway related genes, e.g. CG10348, the fly orthologue of transcriptional regulator PRDM16. Subsequently, PRDM16 was found to be over-expressed in ATRT samples and knockdown of PRDM16 in SMARCB1-deficient rhabdoid tumor cells reduced proliferation.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a subset of genes affected by differential histone modification in ATRT is involved in the detrimental effects of SMARCB1-deficiency and also relevant in the biology of ATRT.",J.

30443783,Chromatin architecture and virulence-related gene expression in eukaryotic microbial pathogens.,"A fundamental question in biology is to understand how appropriate transcriptional regulation and dense packaging of the genetic material within the eukaryotic nucleus are achieved. The exquisite gene expression control and other metabolic processes of DNA require a highly complex, multilayered, three-dimensional architecture of the chromatin and its specific compartmentalization within the nucleus. Some of these architectural and sub-nuclear positioning mechanisms have been extensively co-opted by eukaryotic pathogens to keep fine expression control and expansion of virulence-related gene families in Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma brucei and Candida glabrata. For example non-linear interactions between distant cis-acting regions and the formation of chromatin loops are required for appropriate regulation of the expression of virulence-related multi-gene families encoding cell surface proteins. These gene families are located near the chromosome ends and tethered to the nuclear periphery. Consequently, only one or very few genes of the family are expressed at a time. These genes are involved in antigenic variation in parasites and the generation of subpopulations of cells with diverse antigenic proteins at the surface in some pathogenic fungi, making them highly efficient pathogens.",Curr.

Absolute normalization unmasks global amplification of gene expression associated with trisomy 21. Overexpression of the nucleosome binding protein HMGN1 (encoded on chr21q22) recapitulates transcriptional changes seen with triplication of a Down syndrome critical region on distal chromosome 21, and HMGN1 is necessary for B cell phenotypes in DS models. Absolute exogenous-normalized chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Rx) also reveals a global increase in histone H3K27 acetylation caused by HMGN1. Transcriptional amplification downstream of HMGN1 is enriched for stage-specific programs of B cells and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, dependent on the developmental cellular context.

The chromatin reader Brd4 determines ESC identity. Although Brd4 regulation in gene transcription has been well described, its contribution to the chromatin landscape is less known. Here, we show that Brd4's bromodomains partner with the histone acetyltransferase P300, increasing its enzymatic activities. Augmenting histone acetylation by Brd4-P300 interaction recruits the chromatin remodeler Brg1 altering chromatin structure. This pathway is important for maintaining the expression and chromatin patterns of pluripotency-associated genes, such as Oct4, Nanog, and the X chromosome regulatory long noncoding RNAs Tsix and Xite. Furthermore, we show that the Brd4-P300 interaction regulates the de novo formation of chromatin marks during ESC differentiation, as exemplified by controlling the master regulators of mesoderm formation.

We identified a lamina-associated domain (LAD) border composed of several CTCF-binding elements that segregates active non-LAD from inactive LAD regions of the locus. Deletion of the LAD border causes an enhancer-dependent spread of histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation from the active recombination center into recombination center-proximal LAD chromatin. This is associated with a disruption to nuclear lamina association, increased chromatin looping to the recombination center, and increased transcription and recombination of recombination center-proximal gene segments. Our results show that a LAD and LAD border are critical components of Tcrb locus gene regulation and suggest that LAD borders may generally function to constrain the activity of nearby enhancers.",Cell Rep,2018,"['Chen S', 'Luperchio TR', 'Wong X', 'Doan EB', 'Byrd AT', 'Roy Choudhury K', 'Reddy KL', 'Krangel MS']"
30417101,Mechanism of FACT removal from transcribed genes by anticancer drugs curaxins.,"Human FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) is a multifunctional protein complex that has histone chaperone activity and facilitates nucleosome survival and transcription through chromatin. Anticancer drugs curaxins induce FACT trapping on chromatin of cancer cells (c-trapping), but the mechanism of c-trapping is not fully understood. Here, we show that in cancer cells, FACT is highly enriched within the bodies of actively transcribed genes. Curaxin-dependent c-trapping results in redistribution of FACT from the transcribed chromatin regions to other genomic loci. Using a combination of biochemical and biophysical approaches, we have demonstrated that FACT is bound to and unfolds nucleosomes in the presence of curaxins. This tight binding to the nucleosome results in inhibition of FACT-dependent transcription in vitro in the presence of both curaxins and competitor chromatin, suggesting a mechanism of FACT trapping on bulk nucleosomes (n-trapping).",Sci Adv,2018,"['Chang HW', 'Valieva ME', 'Safina A', 'Chereji RV', 'Wang J', 'Kulaeva OI', 'Morozov AV', 'Kirpichnikov MP', 'Feofanov AV', 'Gurova KV', 'Studitsky VM']"
30417094,Deciphering and engineering chromodomain-methyllysine peptide recognition.,"Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) play critical roles in regulating protein functions and mediating protein-protein interactions. An important PTM is lysine methylation that orchestrates chromatin modifications and regulates functions of non-histone proteins. Methyllysine peptides are bound by modular domains, of which chromodomains are representative. Here, we conducted the first large-scale study of chromodomains in the human proteome interacting with both histone and non-histone methyllysine peptides. We observed significant degenerate binding between chromodomains and histone peptides, i.e., different histone sites can be recognized by the same set of chromodomains, and different chromodomains can share similar binding profiles to individual histone sites. Such degenerate binding is not dictated by amino acid sequence or PTM motif but rather rooted in the physiochemical properties defined by the PTMs on the histone peptides. This molecular mechanism is confirmed by the accurate prediction of the binding specificity using a computational model that captures the structural and energetic patterns of the domain-peptide interaction. To further illustrate the power and accuracy of our model, we used it to effectively engineer an exceptionally strong H3K9me3-binding chromodomain and to label H3K9me3 in live cells. This study presents a systematic approach to deciphering domain-peptide recognition and reveals a general principle by which histone modifications are interpreted by reader proteins, leading to dynamic regulation of gene expression and other biological processes.",Sci Adv,2018,"['Hard R', 'Li N', 'He W', 'Ross B', 'Mo GCH', 'Peng Q', 'Stein RSL', 'Komives E', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang J', 'Wang W']"
30416311,Concept of histone deacetylases in cancer: Reflections on esophageal carcinogenesis and treatment.,"Esophageal cancer (EC) presents a high mortality rate, mainly due to its aggressive nature. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common histological type worldwide, though, a continuous increase in esophageal adenocarcinomas has been noted in the past decades. Common risk factors associated with EC include smoking, alcohol consumption, gastroesophageal reflux disease, Barrett's esophagus and obesity. In an effort to overcome chemotherapy resistance in oncology, it was discovered that histone acetylation/deacetylation equilibrium is altered in carcinogenesis, leading to changes in chromatin structure and altering expression of genes important in the cell cycle, differentiation and apoptosis. Based on this knowledge, histone acetylation was addressed as a potential novel chemotherapy drug target to repress cancer cell proliferation. There are four classes of histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitors with a variety of different mechanisms of actions that render them possible anti-cancer drugs. They arrest the cell cycle, inhibit differentiation and angiogenesis and induce apoptosis. They do not necessarily act on histone proteins, since they can also exert indirect anti-cancer effects, by modifying various cellular proteins. In addition, HDACs have also been associated with increased chemotherapy resistance. Based on the literature, HDACs have been associated with EC, with surveys revealing that increased expression of certain HDACs correlates with advanced TNM stages, tumor grade, metastatic potential and decreased 5-year overall and disease-free survival. The aim of this survey is to elucidate the molecular identity and mechanism of action of HDAC inhibitors as well as verify their potential utility as anti-cancer agents in esophageal cancer.",World J.

30413623,Chromatin modifiers Mdm2 and RNF2 prevent RNA:DNA hybrids that impair DNA replication.,"The p53-Mdm2 system is key to tumor suppression. We have recently reported that p53 as well as Mdm2 are capable of supporting DNA replication fork progression. On the other hand, we found that Mdm2 is a modifier of chromatin, modulating polycomb repressor complex (PRC)-driven histone modifications. Here we show that, similar to Mdm2 knockdown, the depletion of PRC members impairs DNA synthesis, as determined in fiber assays. In particular, the ubiquitin ligase and PRC1 component RNF2/Ring1B is required to support DNA replication, similar to Mdm2. Moreover, the Ring finger domain of Mdm2 is not only essential for its ubiquitin ligase activity, but also for proper DNA replication. Strikingly, Mdm2 overexpression can rescue RNF2 depletion with regard to DNA replication fork progression, and vice versa, strongly suggesting that the two ubiquitin ligases perform overlapping functions in this context. H2A overexpression also rescues fork progression upon depletion of Mdm2 or RNF2, but only when the ubiquitination sites K118/K119 are present. Depleting the H2A deubiquitinating enzyme BAP1 reduces the fork rate, suggesting that both ubiquitination and deubiquitination of H2A are required to support fork progression. The depletion of Mdm2 elicits the accumulation of RNA/DNA hybrids, suggesting R-loop formation as a mechanism of impaired DNA replication. Accordingly, RNase H overexpression or the inhibition of the transcription elongation kinase CDK9 each rescues DNA replication upon depletion of Mdm2 or RNF2. Taken together, our results suggest that chromatin modification by Mdm2 and PRC1 ensures smooth DNA replication through the avoidance of R-loop formation.",Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In that regard, chronic exposure to ethanol modifies DNA and histone methylation, histone acetylation, and microRNA expression.

30402543,Multiple modes of PRC2 inhibition elicit global chromatin alterations in H3K27M pediatric glioma.,"A methionine substitution at lysine-27 on histone H3 variants (H3K27M) characterizes ~80% of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG) and inhibits polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in a dominant-negative fashion. Yet, the mechanisms for this inhibition and abnormal epigenomic landscape have not been resolved. Using quantitative proteomics, we discovered that robust PRC2 inhibition requires levels of H3K27M greatly exceeding those of PRC2, seen in DIPG. While PRC2 inhibition requires interaction with H3K27M, we found that this interaction on chromatin is transient, with PRC2 largely being released from H3K27M. Unexpectedly, inhibition persisted even after PRC2 dissociated from H3K27M-containing chromatin, suggesting a lasting impact on PRC2. Furthermore, allosterically activated PRC2 is particularly sensitive to H3K27M, leading to the failure to spread H3K27me from PRC2 recruitment sites and consequently abrogating PRC2's ability to establish H3K27me2-3 repressive chromatin domains. In turn, levels of polycomb antagonists such as H3K36me2 are elevated, suggesting a more global, downstream effect on the epigenome. Together, these findings reveal the conditions required for H3K27M-mediated PRC2 inhibition and reconcile seemingly paradoxical effects of H3K27M on PRC2 recruitment and activity.",Sci Adv,2018,"['Stafford JM', 'Lee CH', 'Voigt P', 'Descostes N', 'Saldaña-Meyer R', 'Yu JR', 'Leroy G', 'Oksuz O', 'Chapman JR', 'Suarez F', 'Modrek AS', 'Bayin NS', 'Placantonakis DG', 'Karajannis MA', 'Snuderl M', 'Ueberheide B', 'Reinberg D']"

DNMT1 recruitment relies on ubiquitylation of histone H3 by UHRF1; however, how UHRF1 deposits ubiquitin onto the histone is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the ubiquitin-like domain (UBL) of UHRF1 is essential for RING-mediated H3 ubiquitylation. Using chemical crosslinking and mass spectrometry, biochemical assays, and recombinant chromatin substrates, we show that the UBL participates in structural rearrangements of UHRF1 upon binding to chromatin and the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UbcH5a/UBE2D1. Similar to ubiquitin, the UBL exerts its effects through a hydrophobic patch that contacts a regulatory surface on the ""backside"" of the E2 to stabilize the E2-E3-chromatin complex. Our analysis of the enzymatic mechanism of UHRF1 uncovers an unexpected function of the UBL domain and defines a new role for this domain in DNMT1-dependent inheritance of DNA methylation.",Mol.

30392928,Structure of an H1-Bound 6-Nucleosome Array Reveals an Untwisted Two-Start Chromatin Fiber Conformation.,"Chromatin adopts a diversity of regular and irregular fiber structures in vitro and in vivo. However, how an array of nucleosomes folds into and switches between different fiber conformations is poorly understood. We report the 9.7 Å resolution crystal structure of a 6-nucleosome array bound to linker histone H1 determined under ionic conditions that favor incomplete chromatin condensation. The structure reveals a flat two-start helix with uniform nucleosomal stacking interfaces and a nucleosome packing density that is only half that of a twisted 30-nm fiber. Hydroxyl radical footprinting indicates that H1 binds the array in an on-dyad configuration resembling that observed for mononucleosomes. Biophysical, cryo-EM, and crosslinking data validate the crystal structure and reveal that a minor change in ionic environment shifts the conformational landscape to a more compact, twisted form. These findings provide insights into the structural plasticity of chromatin and suggest a possible assembly pathway for a 30-nm fiber.",Mol.

30392877,Targeting epigenetic mechanisms in diabetic wound healing.,"Impaired wound healing is a major secondary complication of type 2 diabetes that often results in limb loss and disability. Normal tissue repair progresses through discrete phases including hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. In diabetes, normal progression through these phases is impaired resulting in a sustained inflammatory state and dysfunctional epithelialization in the wound. Due to their plasticity, macrophages play a critical role in the transition from the inflammation phase to the proliferation phase. Diabetes disrupts macrophage function by impairing monocyte recruitment to the wound, reducing phagocytosis, and prohibiting the transition of inflammatory macrophages to an anti-inflammatory state. Diabetes also impedes keratinocyte and fibroblast function during the later phases resulting in impaired epithelialization of the wound. Several recent studies suggest that altered epigenetic regulation of both immune and structural cells in wounds may influence cell phenotypes and healing, particularly in pathologic states, such as diabetes. Specifically, it has been shown that macrophage plasticity during wound repair is partly regulated epigenetically and that diabetes alters this epigenetic regulation and contributes to a sustained inflammatory state. Epigenetic regulation is also known to regulate keratinocyte and fibroblast function during wound repair. In this review, we provide an introduction to the epigenetic mechanisms that regulate tissue repair and highlight recent findings that demonstrate, how epigenetic events are altered during the course of diabetic wound healing.",Transl Res,2019,"['den Dekker A', 'Davis FM', 'Kunkel SL', 'Gallagher KA']"
30391475,Epigenetics in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a role for histone post-translational modifications in neurodegenerative disease.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the third most common adult onset neurodegenerative disorder worldwide. It is generally characterized by progressive paralysis starting at the limbs ultimately leading to death caused by respiratory failure. There is no cure and current treatments fail to slow the progression of the disease. As such, new treatment options are desperately needed. Epigenetic targets are an attractive possibility because they are reversible. Epigenetics refers to heritable changes in gene expression unrelated to changes in DNA sequence. Three main epigenetic mechanisms include the methylation of DNA, microRNAs and the post-translational modification of histone proteins. Histone modifications occur in many amino acid residues and include phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation as well as other chemical moieties. Recent evidence points to a possible role for epigenetic mechanisms in the etiology of ALS. Here, we review recent advances linking ALS and epigenetics, with a strong focus on histone modifications. Both local and global changes in histone modification profiles are associated with ALS drawing attention to potential targets for future diagnostic and treatment approaches.",Transl Res,2019,"['Bennett SA', 'Tanaz R', 'Cobos SN', 'Torrente MP']"
30391375,Application of modified histone peptide arrays in chromatin research.,"Various post-translational modifications (PTMs) have been identified on histone proteins, which occur at hundreds of different sites. Histone PTMs influence the chromatin structure and serve as binding sites for reading domains, which further mediate downstream effects. Histone PTM antibodies or recombinant proteins derived from reading domains are unique research reagents essentially required to study histone modifications. To validate their specificity, histone PTM peptide arrays are used, because they allow to investigate the binding of proteins to a large number of different peptides in one experiment. Furthermore, histone PTM peptide arrays can be used to characterize reading domains and study the specificity of histone modifying enzymes. Here, we provide an overview of histone PTM peptide arrays, highlight some of their applications and compare different commercial histone PTM peptide arrays, viz. MODified Histone Peptide Array, AbSurance Pro Histone Peptide Microarrays, EpiTriton Histone Peptide Array and Histone Code Microarrays. These arrays contain histone peptides with several post-translational modifications in many different combinations, but they differ in peptide synthesis and immobilization methods, peptide and PTM coverage, and PTM combinatorial potential. In addition, some special applications of histone PTM peptide arrays like custom arrays or double peptide arrays are described.",Arch. Biochem. Biophys.,2019,"['Mauser R', 'Jeltsch A']"

With our case-control study we aimed to identify which chromatin-modifying enzymes could be involved in the pathology of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoarthritis while co-regulated by estrogens, oxidative stress and hypoxia. Gene expression of HAT1, KAT5, HDAC6, MBD1 and DNMT3A affected by oxidative stress and hypoxia in an in vitro qPCR screening step performed on an osteoblast cell line was analysed in trabecular bone tissue samples from 96 patients. Their expression was significantly reduced in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoarthritis as compared to autopsy controls and significantly correlated with bone mineral density and several bone histomorphometry-derived parameters of bone quality and quantity as well as indicators of oxidative stress, RANK/RANKL/OPG system and angiogenesis. Furthermore, oxidative stress increased DNA methylation levels at the RANKL and OPG promoters while decreasing histone acetylation levels at these two genes. Our study is the first to show that higher expression of HAT1, HDAC6 and MBD1 is associated with superior quantity as well as quality of the bone tissue having a more favourable trabecular structure.",Sci Rep,2018,"['Vrtačnik P', 'Zupan J', 'Mlakar V', 'Kranjc T', 'Marc J', 'Kern B', 'Ostanek B']"
30385631,"Vorinostat, a pan-HDAC inhibitor, abrogates productive HPV-18 DNA amplification.","Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) cause epithelial proliferative diseases. Persistent infection of the mucosal epithelia by the high-risk genotypes can progress to high-grade dysplasia and cancers. Viral transcription and protein activities are intimately linked to regulation by histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs) that remodel chromatin and regulate gene expression. HDACs are also essential to remodel and repair replicating chromatin to enable the progression of replication forks. As such, Vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroximic acid), and other pan-HDAC inhibitors, are used to treat lymphomas. Here, we investigated the effects of Vorinostat on productive infection of the high-risk HPV-18 in organotypic cultures of primary human keratinocytes. HPV DNA amplifies in the postmitotic, differentiated cells of squamous epithelia, in which the viral oncoproteins E7 and E6 establish a permissive milieu by destabilizing major tumor suppressors, the pRB family proteins and p53, respectively. We showed that Vorinostat significantly reduced these E6 and E7 activities, abrogated viral DNA amplification, and inhibited host DNA replication. The E7-induced DNA damage response, which is critical for both events, was also compromised. Consequently, Vorinostat exposure led to DNA damage and triggered apoptosis in HPV-infected, differentiated cells, whereas uninfected tissues were spared. Apoptosis was attributed to highly elevated proapoptotic Bim isoforms that are known to be repressed by EZH2 in a repressor complex containing HDACs. Two other HDAC inhibitors, Belinostat and Panobinostat, also inhibited viral DNA amplification and cause apoptosis. We suggest that HDAC inhibitors are promising therapeutic agents to treat benign HPV infections, abrogate progeny virus production, and hence interrupt transmission.",Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

30365520,HJURP antagonizes CENP-A mislocalization driven by the H3.3 chaperones HIRA and DAXX.,"The centromere specific histone H3 variant CENP-A/CENH3 specifies where the kinetochore is formed in most eukaryotes. Despite tight regulation of CENP-A levels in normal cells, overexpression of CENP-A is a feature shared by various types of solid tumors and results in its mislocalization to non-centromeric DNA. How CENP-A is assembled ectopically and the consequences of this mislocalization remain topics of high interest. Here, we report that in human colon cancer cells, the H3.3 chaperones HIRA and DAXX promote ectopic CENP-A deposition. Moreover, the correct balance between levels of the centromeric chaperone HJURP and CENP-A is essential to preclude ectopic assembly by H3.3 chaperones. In addition, we find that ectopic localization can recruit kinetochore components, and correlates with mitotic defects and DNA damage in G1 phase. Finally, CENP-A occupancy at the 8q24 locus is also correlated with amplification and overexpression of the MYC gene within that locus. Overall, these data provide insights into the causes and consequences of histone variant mislocalization in human cancer cells.",PLoS ONE,2018,"['Nye J', 'Sturgill D', 'Athwal R', 'Dalal Y']"
30361685,Dual inhibition of PI3K signaling and histone deacetylation halts proliferation and induces lethality in mantle cell lymphoma.,"The dysregulation of PI3K signaling has been implicated as an underlying mechanism associated with resistance to Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibition by ibrutinib in both chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Ibrutinib resistance has become a major unmet clinical need, and the development of therapeutics to overcome ibrutinib resistance will greatly improve the poor outcomes of ibrutinib-exposed MCL patients. CUDC-907 inhibits both PI3K and HDAC functionality to exert synergistic or additive effects. Therefore, the activity of CUDC-907 was examined in MCL cell lines and patient primary cells, including ibrutinib-resistant MCL cells. The efficacy of CUDC-907 was further examined in an ibrutinib-resistant MCL patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse model. The molecular mechanisms by which CUDC-907 dually inhibits PI3K and histone deacetylation were assessed using reverse protein array, immunoblotting, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with sequencing. We showed evidence that CUDC-907 treatment increased histone acetylation in MCL cells. We found that CUDC-907 caused decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis in MCL in vitro and in vivo MCL models. In addition, CUDC-907 was effective in inducing lethality in ibrutinib-resistant MCL cells. Lastly, CUDC-907 treatment increased histone acetylation in MCL cells. Overall, these studies suggest that CUDC-907 may be a promising therapeutic option for relapsed or resistant MCL.",Oncogene,2019,"['Guo H', 'Zeng D', 'Zhang H', 'Bell T', 'Yao J', 'Liu Y', 'Huang S', 'Li CJ', 'Lorence E', 'Zhou S', 'Gong T', 'Jiang C', 'Ahmed M', 'Yao Y', 'Nomie KJ', 'Zhang L', 'Wang M']"
30358439,HDAC8 inhibition ameliorates pulmonary fibrosis.,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fibroproliferative lung disease, and fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation (FMD) is thought to be a key event in the pathogenesis of IPF. Histone deacetylase-8 (HDAC8) has been shown to associate with α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA; a marker of FMD) and regulates cell contractility in vascular smooth muscle cells. However, the role of HDAC8 in FMD or pulmonary fibrosis has never been reported. This study investigated the role of HDAC8 in pulmonary fibrosis with a focus on FMD. We observed that HDAC8 expression was increased in IPF lung tissue as well as transforming growth factor (TGF)β1-treated normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs). Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that HDAC8 was associated with α-SMA in TGFβ1-treated NHLFs. HDAC8 inhibition with NCC170 (HDAC8-selective inhibitor) repressed TGFβ1-induced fibroblast contraction and α-SMA protein expression in NHLFs cultured in collagen gels. HDAC8 inhibition with HDAC8 siRNA also repressed TGFβ1-induced expression of profibrotic molecules such as fibronectin and increased expression of antifibrotic molecules such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ). Chromatin immunoprecipitation quantitative PCR using an antibody against H3K27ac (histone H3 acetylated at lysine 27; a known HDAC8 substrate and a marker for active enhancers) suggested that HDAC8 inhibition with NCC170 ameliorated TGFβ1-induced loss of H3K27ac at the PPARγ gene enhancer. Furthermore, NCC170 treatment significantly decreased fibrosis measured by Ashcroft score as well as expression of type 1 collagen and fibronectin in bleomycin-treated mouse lungs. These data suggest that HDAC8 contributes to pulmonary fibrosis and that there is a therapeutic potential for HDAC8 inhibitors to treat IPF as well as other fibrotic lung diseases.",Am. J. Physiol.

30355601,Expanding heterochromatin reveals discrete subtelomeric domains delimited by chromatin landscape transitions.,"The eukaryotic genome is divided into chromosomal domains of heterochromatin and euchromatin. Transcriptionally silent heterochromatin is found at subtelomeric regions, leading to the telomeric position effect (TPE) in yeast, fly, and human. Heterochromatin generally initiates and spreads from defined loci, and diverse mechanisms prevent the ectopic spread of heterochromatin into euchromatin. Here, we overexpressed the silencing factor Sir3 at varying levels in yeast and found that Sir3 spreads into extended silent domains (ESDs), eventually reaching saturation at subtelomeres. We observed the spread of Sir3 into subtelomeric domains associated with specific histone marks in wild-type cells, and stopping at zones of histone mark transitions including H3K79 trimethylation levels. Our study shows that the conserved H3K79 methyltransferase Dot1 is essential in restricting Sir3 spread beyond ESDs, thus ensuring viability upon overexpression of Sir3. Last, our analyses of published data demonstrate how ESDs unveil uncharacterized discrete domains isolating structural and functional subtelomeric features from the rest of the genome.

30350439,Molecular basis for chromatin assembly and modification by multiprotein complexes.,"Epigenetic regulation of the chromatin landscape is often orchestrated through modulation of nucleosomes. Nucleosomes are composed of two copies each of the four core histones, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, wrapped in ~150 bp of DNA. We focus this review on recent structural studies that further elucidate the mechanisms used by macromolecular complexes to mediate histone modification and nucleosome assembly. Nucleosome assembly, spacing, and variant histone incorporation are coordinated by chromatin remodeler and histone chaperone complexes. Several recent structural studies highlight how disparate families of histone chaperones and chromatin remodelers share similar features that underlie how they interact with their respective histone or nucleosome substrates. Post-translational modification of histone residues is mediated by enzymatic subunits within large complexes. Until recently, relatively little was known about how association with auxiliary subunits serves to modulate the activity and specificity of the enzymatic subunit. Analysis of several recent structures highlights the different modes that auxiliary subunits use to influence enzymatic activity or direct specificity toward individual histone residues.",Protein Sci.,2019,"['Ricketts MD', 'Han J', 'Szurgot MR', 'Marmorstein R']"

We observed widespread acetylomic variation associated with AD neuropathology, identifying 4,162 differential peaks (false discovery rate < 0.05) between AD cases and controls. Differentially acetylated peaks were enriched in disease-related biological pathways and included regions annotated to genes involved in the progression of amyloid-β and tau pathology (for example, APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, and MAPT), as well as regions containing variants associated with sporadic late-onset AD. Partitioned heritability analysis highlighted a highly significant enrichment of AD risk variants in entorhinal cortex H3K27ac peak regions. AD-associated variable H3K27ac was associated with transcriptional variation at proximal genes including CR1, GPR22, KMO, PIM3, PSEN1, and RGCC.

30348795,Extensile motor activity drives coherent motions in a model of interphase chromatin.,"The 3D spatiotemporal organization of the human genome inside the cell nucleus remains a major open question in cellular biology. In the time between two cell divisions, chromatin-the functional form of DNA in cells-fills the nucleus in its uncondensed polymeric form. Recent in vivo imaging experiments reveal that the chromatin moves coherently, having displacements with long-ranged correlations on the scale of micrometers and lasting for seconds. To elucidate the mechanism(s) behind these motions, we develop a coarse-grained active polymer model where chromatin is represented as a confined flexible chain acted upon by molecular motors that drive fluid flows by exerting dipolar forces on the system. Numerical simulations of this model account for steric and hydrodynamic interactions as well as internal chain mechanics. These demonstrate that coherent motions emerge in systems involving extensile dipoles and are accompanied by large-scale chain reconfigurations and nematic ordering. Comparisons with experiments show good qualitative agreement and support the hypothesis that self-organizing long-ranged hydrodynamic couplings between chromatin-associated active motor proteins are responsible for the observed coherent dynamics.",Proc.

30344095,The Histone Chaperone FACT Coordinates H2A.X-Dependent Signaling and Repair of DNA Damage.,"Safeguarding cell function and identity following a genotoxic stress challenge entails a tight coordination of DNA damage signaling and repair with chromatin maintenance. How this coordination is achieved and with what impact on chromatin integrity remains elusive. Here, we address these questions by investigating the mechanisms governing the distribution in mammalian chromatin of the histone variant H2A.X, a central player in damage signaling. We reveal that H2A.X is deposited de novo at sites of DNA damage in a repair-coupled manner, whereas the H2A.Z variant is evicted, thus reshaping the chromatin landscape at repair sites. Our mechanistic studies further identify the histone chaperone FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) as responsible for the deposition of newly synthesized H2A.X. Functionally, we demonstrate that FACT potentiates H2A.X-dependent signaling of DNA damage. We propose that new H2A.X deposition in chromatin reflects DNA damage experience and may help tailor DNA damage signaling to repair progression.",Mol.

30335163,Long non-coding RNA ChRO1 facilitates ATRX/DAXX-dependent H3.3 deposition for transcription-associated heterochromatin reorganization.,"Constitutive heterochromatin undergoes a dynamic clustering and spatial reorganization during myogenic differentiation. However the detailed mechanisms and its role in cell differentiation remain largely elusive. Here, we report the identification of a muscle-specific long non-coding RNA, ChRO1, involved in constitutive heterochromatin reorganization. ChRO1 is induced during terminal differentiation of myoblasts, and is specifically localized to the chromocenters in myotubes. ChRO1 is required for efficient cell differentiation, with global impacts on gene expression. It influences DNA methylation and chromatin compaction at peri/centromeric regions. Inhibition of ChRO1 leads to defects in the spatial fusion of chromocenters, and mislocalization of H4K20 trimethylation, Suv420H2, HP1, MeCP2 and cohesin. In particular, ChRO1 specifically associates with ATRX/DAXX/H3.3 complex at chromocenters to promote H3.3 incorporation and transcriptional induction of satellite repeats, which is essential for chromocenter clustering. Thus, our results unveil a mechanism involving a lncRNA that plays a role in large-scale heterochromatin reorganization and cell differentiation.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2018,"['Park J', 'Lee H', 'Han N', 'Kwak S', 'Lee HT', 'Kim JH', 'Kang K', 'Youn BH', 'Yang JH', 'Jeong HJ', 'Kang JS', 'Kim SY', 'Han JW', 'Youn HD', 'Cho EJ']"
30333309,Histone H2A monoubiquitylation and p38-MAPKs regulate immediate-early gene-like reactivation of latent retrovirus HTLV-1.,"It is not understood how the human T cell leukemia virus human T-lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1), a retrovirus, regulates the in vivo balance between transcriptional latency and reactivation. The HTLV-1 proviral plus-strand is typically transcriptionally silent in freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from infected individuals, but after short-term ex vivo culture, there is a strong, spontaneous burst of proviral plus-strand transcription. Here, we demonstrate that proviral reactivation in freshly isolated, naturally infected primary CD4+ T cells has 3 key attributes characteristic of an immediate-early gene. Plus-strand transcription is p38-MAPK dependent and is not inhibited by protein synthesis inhibitors. Ubiquitylation of histone H2A (H2AK119ub1), a signature of polycomb repressive complex-1 (PRC1), is enriched at the latent HTLV-1 provirus, and immediate-early proviral reactivation is associated with rapid deubiquitylation of H2A at the provirus. Inhibition of deubiquitylation by the deubiquitinase (DUB) inhibitor PR619 reverses H2AK119ub1 depletion and strongly inhibits plus-strand transcription. We conclude that the HTLV-1 proviral plus-strand is regulated with characteristics of a cellular immediate-early gene, with a PRC1-dependent bivalent promoter sensitive to p38-MAPK signaling. Finally, we compare the epigenetic signatures of p38-MAPK inhibition, DUB inhibition, and glucose deprivation at the HTLV-1 provirus, and we show that these pathways act as independent checkpoints regulating proviral reactivation from latency.",JCI Insight,2018,"['Kulkarni A', 'Taylor GP', 'Klose RJ', 'Schofield CJ', 'Bangham CR']"
30327463,PWWP2A binds distinct chromatin moieties and interacts with an MTA1-specific core NuRD complex.,"Chromatin structure and function is regulated by reader proteins recognizing histone modifications and/or histone variants. We recently identified that PWWP2A tightly binds to H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes and is involved in mitotic progression and cranial-facial development. Here, using in vitro assays, we show that distinct domains of PWWP2A mediate binding to free linker DNA as well as H3K36me3 nucleosomes. In vivo, PWWP2A strongly recognizes H2A.Z-containing regulatory regions and weakly binds H3K36me3-containing gene bodies. Further, PWWP2A binds to an MTA1-specific subcomplex of the NuRD complex (M1HR), which consists solely of MTA1, HDAC1, and RBBP4/7, and excludes CHD, GATAD2 and MBD proteins. Depletion of PWWP2A leads to an increase of acetylation levels on H3K27 as well as H2A.Z, presumably by impaired chromatin recruitment of M1HR. Thus, this study identifies PWWP2A as a complex chromatin-binding protein that serves to direct the deacetylase complex M1HR to H2A.Z-containing chromatin, thereby promoting changes in histone acetylation levels.",Nat Commun,2018,"['Link S', 'Spitzer RMM', 'Sana M', 'Torrado M', 'Völker-Albert MC', 'Keilhauer EC', 'Burgold T', 'Pünzeler S', 'Low JKK', 'Lindström I', 'Nist A', 'Regnard C', 'Stiewe T', 'Hendrich B', 'Imhof A', 'Mann M', 'Mackay JP', 'Bartkuhn M', 'Hake SB']"

MATERIALS & METHODS: In breast tumors, H3K4ac enrichment and its link with TIP60 were evaluated by chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR and re-chromatin immunoprecipitation techniques. To assess the biological roles of TIP60 in breast cancer, two cell lines of breast cancer, MDA-MB-231 (ER-) and MCF-7 (ER+) were transfected with shRNA specifically targeting TIP60 and injected to athymic Balb-c mice.
RESULTS: We identified a potential target of TIP60, H3K4. We show that an underexpression of TIP60 could contribute to a reduction of H3K4 acetylation in breast cancer. An increase in tumor development was noted in sh-TIP60 MDA-MB-231 xenografts and a slowdown of tumor growth in sh-TIP60 MCF-7 xenografts.

30322003,Reading More than Histones: The Prevalence of Nucleic Acid Binding among Reader Domains.,"The eukaryotic genome is packaged into the cell nucleus in the form of chromatin, a complex of genomic DNA and histone proteins. Chromatin structure regulation is critical for all DNA templated processes and involves, among many things, extensive post-translational modification of the histone proteins. These modifications can be ""read out"" by histone binding subdomains known as histone reader domains. A large number of reader domains have been identified and found to selectively recognize an array of histone post-translational modifications in order to target, retain, or regulate chromatin-modifying and remodeling complexes at their substrates. Interestingly, an increasing number of these histone reader domains are being identified as also harboring nucleic acid binding activity. In this review, we present a summary of the histone reader domains currently known to bind nucleic acids, with a focus on the molecular mechanisms of binding and the interplay between DNA and histone recognition. Additionally, we highlight the functional implications of nucleic acid binding in chromatin association and regulation. We propose that nucleic acid binding is as functionally important as histone binding, and that a significant portion of the as yet untested reader domains will emerge to have nucleic acid binding capabilities.",Molecules,2018,"['Weaver TM', 'Morrison EA', 'Musselman CA']"
30312361,SETD2-dependent H3K36me3 plays a critical role in epigenetic regulation of the HPV31 life cycle.,"The life cycle of HPV is tied to the differentiation status of its host cell, with productive replication, late gene expression and virion production restricted to the uppermost layers of the stratified epithelium. HPV DNA is histone-associated, exhibiting a chromatin structure similar to that of the host chromosome. Although HPV chromatin is subject to histone post-translational modifications, how the viral life cycle is epigenetically regulated is not well understood. SETD2 is a histone methyltransferase that places the trimethyl mark on H3K36 (H3K36me3), a mark of active transcription. Here, we define a role for SETD2 and H3K36me3 in the viral life cycle. We have found that HPV positive cells exhibit increased levels of SETD2, with SETD2 depletion leading to defects in productive viral replication and splicing of late viral RNAs. Reducing H3K36me3 by overexpression of KDM4A, an H3K36me3 demethylase, or an H3.3K36M transgene also blocks productive viral replication, indicating a significant role for this histone modification in facilitating viral processes. H3K36me3 is enriched on the 3' end of the early region of the high-risk HPV31 genome in a SETD2-dependent manner, suggesting that SETD2 may regulate the viral life cycle through the recruitment of H3K36me3 readers to viral DNA. Intriguingly, we have found that activation of the ATM DNA damage kinase, which is required for productive viral replication, is necessary for the maintenance of H3K36me3 on viral chromatin and for processing of late viral RNAs. Additionally, we have found that the HPV31 E7 protein maintains the increased SETD2 levels in infected cells through an extension of protein half-life. Collectively, our findings highlight the importance of epigenetic modifications in driving the viral life cycle and identify a novel role for E7 as well as the DNA damage response in the regulation of viral processes through epigenetic modifications.",PLoS Pathog.,2018,"['Gautam D', 'Johnson BA', 'Mac M', 'Moody CA']"

Here, we show a radiation-induced increase in the level of H4K20me3 while the levels of H4K20me1 and H4K20me2 remained intact. H4K20me3 was significantly pronounced at DNA lesions in only the G1 phase of the cycle, while this histone mark was reduced in very late S and G2 phases when PCNA was recruited to locally micro-irradiated chromatin. H4K20me3 was diminished in locally irradiated Suv39h1/h2 double knockout (dn) fibroblasts, and the same phenomenon was observed for H3K9me3 and its binding partner, the HP1β protein. Immunoprecipitation showed the existence of an interaction between H3K9me3-53BP1 and H4K20me3-53BP1; however, HP1β did not interact with 53BP1. Together, H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 represent epigenetic markers that are important for the function of the 53BP1 protein in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair.

The kinase activity of MSK1 is activated by intramolecular autophosphorylation, which is initially triggered by the activation of upstream mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), such as p38 and ERK1/2. MSK1 has been implicated in the expression of p21, a p53 target gene; however, the precise connection between MSK1 and p53 has not been clearly elucidated. Here, using in vitro and cell-based transcription assays, we show that MSK1 functions as a transcriptional coactivator of p53 in p21 expression, an action associated with MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of MSK1 and elevated kinase activity. Of special significance, we show that MSK1 directly interacts with p53 and is recruited to the p21 promoter, where it phosphorylates histone H3 in a p53-dependent manner. In addition, phosphomimetic mutant analysis demonstrated that negative charges in the hydrophobic motif are critical for serine 212 phosphorylation in the N-terminal kinase domain, which renders MSK1 competent for histone kinase activity. These studies suggest that MSK1 acts through a direct interaction with p53 to function as a transcriptional coactivator and that MSK1 activation by upstream MAPK signaling is important for efficient p21 gene expression.",Exp.

30304806,Controversial Impact of Sirtuins in Chronic Non-Transmissible Diseases and Rehabilitation Medicine.,"A large body of evidence reports about the positive effects of physical activity in pathophysiological conditions associated with aging. Physical exercise, alone or in combination with other medical therapies, unquestionably causes reduction of symptoms in chronic non-transmissible diseases often leading to significant amelioration or complete healing. The molecular basis of this exciting outcome-however, remain largely obscure. Epigenetics, exploring at the interface between environmental signals and the remodeling of chromatin structure, promises to shed light on this intriguing matter possibly contributing to the identification of novel therapeutic targets. In this review, we shall focalize on the role of sirtuins (Sirts) a class III histone deacetylases (HDACs), which function has been frequently associated, often with a controversial role, to the pathogenesis of aging-associated pathophysiological conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular, muscular, neurodegenerative, bones and respiratory diseases. Numerous studies, in fact, demonstrate that Sirt-dependent pathways are activated upon physical and cognitive exercises linking mitochondrial function, DNA structure remodeling and gene expression regulation to designed medical therapies leading to tangible beneficial outcomes. However, in similar conditions, other studies assign to sirtuins a negative pathophysiological role. In spite of this controversial effect, it is doubtless that studying sirtuins in chronic diseases might lead to an unprecedented improvement of life quality in the elderly.",Int J Mol Sci,2018,"['Mongelli A', 'Gaetano C']"
30301810,Highly disordered histone H1-DNA model complexes and their condensates.,"Disordered proteins play an essential role in a wide variety of biological processes, and are often posttranslationally modified. One such protein is histone H1; its highly disordered C-terminal tail (CH1) condenses internucleosomal linker DNA in chromatin in a way that is still poorly understood. Moreover, CH1 is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner that correlates with changes in the chromatin condensation level. Here we present a model system that recapitulates key aspects of the in vivo process, and also allows a detailed structural and biophysical analysis of the stages before and after condensation. CH1 remains disordered in the DNA-bound state, despite its nanomolar affinity. Phase-separated droplets (coacervates) form, containing higher-order assemblies of CH1/DNA complexes. Phosphorylation at three serine residues, spaced along the length of the tail, has little effect on the local properties of the condensate. However, it dramatically alters higher-order structure in the coacervate and reduces partitioning to the coacervate phase. These observations show that disordered proteins can bind tightly to DNA without a disorder-to-order transition. Importantly, they also provide mechanistic insights into how higher-order structures can be exquisitely sensitive to perturbation by posttranslational modifications, thus broadening the repertoire of mechanisms that might regulate chromatin and other macromolecular assemblies.",Proc.

30298650,Epigenetic targeting for acute kidney injury.,"In recent years, epigenetics has emerged as important mechanisms for the regulation of pathogenesis in many diseases, including acute kidney injury (AKI). Numerous studies have demonstrated that AKI is associated with the changes in epigenetics, including histone modifications, DNA methylation and the expression of various non-coding RNAs. Through utilizing histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, studies have demonstrated that increase of histone acetylation either protects kidney from injury or potentiates this process, depending on which HDAC (s) isform is suppressed, whereas inhibition of histone methyltransferase, generally provides a protective effect in AKI. Although AKI is also associated with changes in DNA methylation, the role of DNA methylation in kidney injury remains unclear. In this article, we discuss the role and mechanism of histone acetylation and methylation in the pathogenesis of AKI.",Nephrology (Carlton),2018,['Zhuang S']
30298590,Characterization and comparison of neutrophil extracellular traps in gingival samples of periodontitis and gingivitis: A pilot study.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are a recently discovered antimicrobial mechanism used by neutrophils that have been proposed as an intervention in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. The objective of our study was to characterize the expression of NETs in gingival tissues with periodontitis and controls and to compare the expression of these traps in gingival tissue samples of patients with gingivitis and periodontitis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted on patients with periodontitis, gingivitis, and controls that needed tooth extraction. Gingival tissue biopsies were gathered after clinical examination and tooth extraction. Electron microscopy and immunofluorescence were performed to characterize NETs, comparing periodontitis and control patients. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to quantify neutrophil extracellular trap expression through extracellular citrullinated histone H3 and myeloperoxidase in biopsies from patients with gingivitis and periodontitis.
RESULTS: Thirteen biopsies were gathered from 13 patients: five gingivitis, six periodontitis, and two controls. Electron microscopy and immunofluorescence imaging showed greater expression of neutrophils present in periodontal inflamed tissue compared with controls. Release of nuclear content to the extracellular space was observed, compatible with the formation of NETs. The expression of citrullinated histone H3 was higher in gingivitis samples than periodontitis samples (P = 0.0106). Myeloperoxidase expression was higher in periodontitis than gingivitis, but without achieving statistical significance.
CONCLUSION: Neutrophil extracellular traps were found in tissue samples of periodontitis as extracellular components of chromatin, along with neutrophil enzymes, that were not present in healthy controls. The comparison of NETs expression in periodontitis and gingivitis showed higher expression in gingivitis, associating them to acute phases of the periodontal inflammatory process.",J. Periodont.

30296942,CRISPR-mediated deletion of prostate cancer risk-associated CTCF loop anchors identifies repressive chromatin loops.,"BACKGROUND: Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 100 loci associated with increased risk of prostate cancer, most of which are in non-coding regions of the genome. Understanding the function of these non-coding risk loci is critical to elucidate the genetic susceptibility to prostate cancer.
RESULTS: We generate genome-wide regulatory element maps and performed genome-wide chromosome confirmation capture assays (in situ Hi-C) in normal and tumorigenic prostate cells. Using this information, we annotate the regulatory potential of 2,181 fine-mapped prostate cancer risk-associated SNPs and predict a set of target genes that are regulated by prostate cancer risk-related H3K27Ac-mediated loops. We next identify prostate cancer risk-associated CTCF sites involved in long-range chromatin loops. We use CRISPR-mediated deletion to remove prostate cancer risk-associated CTCF anchor regions and the CTCF anchor regions looped to the prostate cancer risk-associated CTCF sites, and we observe up to 100-fold increases in expression of genes within the loops when the prostate cancer risk-associated CTCF anchor regions are deleted.
CONCLUSIONS: We identify GWAS risk loci involved in long-range loops that function to repress gene expression within chromatin loops.

30295665,Repressing Gene Transcription by Redirecting Cellular Machinery with Chemical Epigenetic Modifiers.,"Regulation of chromatin compaction is an important process that governs gene expression in higher eukaryotes. Although chromatin compaction and gene expression regulation are commonly disrupted in many diseases, a locus-specific, endogenous, and reversible method to study and control these mechanisms of action has been lacking. To address this issue, we have developed and characterized novel gene-regulating bifunctional molecules. One component of the bifunctional molecule binds to a DNA-protein anchor so that it will be recruited to an allele-specific locus. The other component engages endogenous cellular chromatin-modifying machinery, recruiting these proteins to a gene of interest. These small molecules, called chemical epigenetic modifiers (CEMs), are capable of controlling gene expression and the chromatin environment in a dose-dependent and reversible manner. Here, we detail a CEM approach and its application to decrease gene expression and histone tail acetylation at a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) reporter located at the Oct4 locus in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We characterize the lead CEM (CEM23) using fluorescent microscopy, flow cytometry, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), followed by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). While the power of this system is demonstrated at the Oct4 locus, conceptually, the CEM technology is modular and can be applied in other cell types and at other genomic loci.",J Vis Exp,2018,"['Chiarella AM', 'Wang TA', 'Butler KV', 'Jin J', 'Hathaway NA']"
30293838,Inheritance of CENP-A Nucleosomes during DNA Replication Requires HJURP.,"Centromeric chromatin defines the site of kinetochore formation and ensures faithful chromosome segregation. Centromeric identity is epigenetically specified by the incorporation of CENP-A nucleosomes. DNA replication presents a challenge for inheritance of centromeric identity because nucleosomes are removed to allow for replication fork progression. Despite this challenge, CENP-A nucleosomes are stably retained through S phase. We used BioID to identify proteins transiently associated with CENP-A during DNA replication. We found that during S phase, HJURP transiently associates with centromeres and binds to pre-existing CENP-A, suggesting a distinct role for HJURP in CENP-A retention. We demonstrate that HJURP is required for centromeric nucleosome inheritance during S phase. HJURP co-purifies with the MCM2-7 helicase complex and, together with the MCM2 subunit, binds CENP-A simultaneously. Therefore, pre-existing CENP-A nucleosomes require an S phase function of the HJURP chaperone and interaction with MCM2 to ensure faithful inheritance of centromere identity through DNA replication.",Dev.

30293567,BRG1 regulates NOX gene transcription in endothelial cells and contributes to cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"Excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is considered a major culprit for a host of cardiovascular diseases. In vascular endothelial cells, ROS production is mediated by NAPDH oxidases (NOX). In the present study we investigated the role of the chromatin remodeling protein BRG1 in NOX trans-activation as well as its implication in cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury. We report that in response to hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) BRG1 was recruited to the NOX promoter regions in both immortalized endothelial cells and primary microvascular endothelial cells. BRG1 knockdown attenuated the induction of NOX genes by HR stimulation. Suppression of NOX trans-activation by BRG1 silencing was paralleled by the loss of active histone modifications (acetylation of histones H3 and H4) and the re-appearance of repressive histone modification (dimethylation of histone H3K9) surrounding the NOX promoter. Of interest, the H3K9 demethylase KDM3A bound to the NOX promoters with kinetics similar to BRG1 and interacted with BRG1 to activate NOX transcription. KDM3A depletion ameliorated NOX induction and ROS production in endothelial cells exposed to HR. Finally, mice with endothelial-specific deletion of BRG1 were protected from cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury. In conclusion, our data suggest that BRG1 may link epigenetic activation of NOX transcription in endothelial cells to cardiac ischemia reperfusion injury.",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Basis Dis,2018,"['Li Z', 'Zhang X', 'Liu S', 'Zeng S', 'Yu L', 'Yang G', 'Guo J', 'Xu Y']"
30291224,IL-17A-associated IKK-α signaling induced TSLP production in epithelial cells of COPD patients.,"Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a cytokine expressed in the epithelium, involved in the pathogenesis of chronic disease. IL-17A regulates airway inflammation, oxidative stress, and reduction of steroid sensitivity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). TSLP and IL-17A were measured in induced sputum supernatants (ISs) from healthy controls (HC), healthy smokers (HS), and COPD patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Human bronchial epithelial cell line (16HBE) and normal bronchial epithelial cells were stimulated with rhIL-17A or ISs from COPD patients to evaluate TSLP protein and mRNA expression. The effects of the depletion of IL-17A in ISs, an anticholinergic drug, and the silencing of inhibitor kappa kinase alpha (IKKα) on TSLP production were evaluated in 16HBE cells. Coimmunoprecipitation of acetyl-histone H3(Lys14)/IKKα was evaluated in 16HBE cells treated with rhIL-17A and in the presence of the drug. TSLP and IL-17A levels were higher in ISs from COPD patients and HS compared with HC. TSLP protein and mRNA increased in 16HBE cells and in normal bronchial epithelial cells stimulated with ISs from COPD patients compared with ISs from HC and untreated cells. IKKα silencing reduced TSLP production in 16HBE cells stimulated with rhIL-17A and ISs from COPD patients. RhIL-17A increased the IKKα/acetyl-histone H3 immunoprecipitation in 16HBE cells. The anticholinergic drug affects TSLP protein and mRNA levels in bronchial epithelial cells treated with rhIL-17A or with ISs from COPD patients, and IKKα mediated acetyl-histone H3(Lys14). IL-17A/IKKα signaling induced the mechanism of chromatin remodeling associated with acetyl-histone H3(Lys14) and TSLP production in bronchial epithelial cells.

Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of RNAPII-nucleosome complexes in which RNAPII pauses at the superhelical locations SHL(-6), SHL(-5), SHL(-2), and SHL(-1) of the nucleosome. RNAPII pauses at the major histone-DNA contact sites, and the nucleosome interactions with the RNAPII subunits stabilize the pause. These structures reveal snapshots of nucleosomal transcription, in which RNAPII gradually tears DNA from the histone surface while preserving the histone octamer. The nucleosomes in the SHL(-1) complexes are bound to a ""foreign"" DNA segment, which might explain the histone transfer mechanism.

Overexpression of KDM6B has been reported in BM HSPCs of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Whether the overexpression of KDM6B contributes to the pathogenesis of these diseases remains to be elucidated. To study this, we generated a Vav-KDM6B mouse model, which overexpresses KDM6B in the hematopoietic compartment. KDM6B overexpression alone led to mild hematopoietic phenotype, and chronic innate immune stimulation of Vav-KDM6B mice with the Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in significant hematopoietic defects. These defects recapitulated features of MDS and CMML, including leukopenia, dysplasia, and compromised repopulating function of BM HSPCs.

Paradoxically, in vitro methyltransferase assays revealed that Dpy-30 only modestly participates in the positive heterotypic allosteric regulation of these methyltransferases. Detailed genome-wide, molecular and structural studies reveal that an extensive network of interactions taking place at the interface between Dpy-30 and Ash2L are critical for the correct placement, genome-wide, of H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 but marginally contribute to the methyltransferase activity of KMT2 enzymes in vitro. Moreover, we show that H3K4me2 peaks persisting following the loss of Dpy-30 are found in regions of highly transcribed genes, highlighting an interplay between Complex of Proteins Associated with SET1 (COMPASS) kinetics and the cycling of RNA polymerase to control H3K4 methylation.

Here, we aim to validate the clinical impact of CDX2 and investigate the role of promoter methylation and histone deacetylation in CDX2 repression and restoration.
METHODS: CDX2 immunohistochemistry was performed on multi-punch tissue microarrays (n = 637 patients). Promoter methylation and protein expression investigated on 11 colorectal cancer cell lines identified two CDX2 low expressors (SW620, COLO205) for treatment with decitabine (DNA methyltransferase inhibitor), trichostatin A (TSA) (general HDAC inhibitor), and LMK-235 (specific HDAC4 and HDAC5 inhibitor). RNA and protein levels were assessed. HDAC5 recruitment to the CDX2 gene promoter region was tested by chromatin immunoprecipitation.
RESULTS: Sixty percent of tumors showed focal CDX2 loss; 5% were negative. Reduced CDX2 was associated with lymph node metastasis (p = 0.0167), distant metastasis (p = 0.0123), and unfavorable survival (multivariate analysis: p = 0.0008; HR (95%CI) 0.922 (0.988-0.997)) as well as BRAF
CONCLUSION: CDX2 loss is an adverse prognostic factor and linked to molecular features of the serrated pathway.

30253781,The synthetic histone-binding regulator protein PcTF activates interferon genes in breast cancer cells.,"BACKGROUND: Mounting evidence from genome-wide studies of cancer shows that chromatin-mediated epigenetic silencing at large cohorts of genes is strongly linked to a poor prognosis. This mechanism is thought to prevent cell differentiation and enable evasion of the immune system. Drugging the cancer epigenome with small molecule inhibitors to release silenced genes from the repressed state has emerged as a powerful approach for cancer research and drug development. Targets of these inhibitors include chromatin-modifying enzymes that can acquire drug-resistant mutations. In order to directly target a generally conserved feature, elevated trimethyl-lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3), we developed the Polycomb-based Transcription Factor (PcTF), a fusion activator that targets methyl-histone marks via its N-terminal H3K27me3-binding motif, and co-regulates sets of silenced genes.
RESULTS: Here, we report transcriptome profiling analyses of PcTF-treated breast cancer model cell lines. We identified a set of 19 PcTF-upregulated genes, or PUGs, that were consistent across three distinct breast cancer cell lines. These genes are associated with the interferon response pathway.

30252564,The relationship between histone posttranslational modification and DNA damage signaling and repair.,"PURPOSE: The cellular response to DNA damage occurs in the context of an organized chromatin environment in order to maintain genome integrity. Immediately after DNA damage, an array of histone modifications are induced to relieve the physical constraints of the chromatin environment, mark the site as damaged, and function as a platform for the assembly of mediator and effector proteins of DNA damage response signaling pathway. Changes in chromatin structure in the vicinity of the DNA double-strand break (DSB) facilitates the efficient initiation of the DNA damage signaling cascade. Failure of induction of DNA damage responsive histone modifications may lead to genome instability and cancer. Here we will discuss our current understanding of the DNA damage responsive histone modifications and their role in DNA repair as well as their implications for genome stability. We further discuss recent studies which highlight not only how histone modification has involved in the signaling and remodeling at the DSB but also how it influences the DNA repair pathway choice.
CONCLUSIONS: Histone modifications pattern alter during the induction of DNA DSBs induction as well as during the repair and recovery phase of DNA damage response. It will be interesting to understand more precisely, how DSBs within chromatin are repaired by HR and NHEJ.

30239791,Mechanistic insights into histone deposition and nucleosome assembly by the chromatin assembly factor-1.,"Eukaryotic chromatin is a highly dynamic structure with essential roles in virtually all DNA-dependent cellular processes. Nucleosomes are a barrier to DNA access, and during DNA replication, they are disassembled ahead of the replication machinery (the replisome) and reassembled following its passage. The Histone chaperone Chromatin Assembly Factor-1 (CAF-1) interacts with the replisome and deposits H3-H4 directly onto newly synthesized DNA. Therefore, CAF-1 is important for the establishment and propagation of chromatin structure. The molecular mechanism by which CAF-1 mediates H3-H4 deposition has remained unclear. However, recent studies have revealed new insights into the architecture and stoichiometry of the trimeric CAF-1 complex and how it interacts with and deposits H3-H4 onto substrate DNA. The CAF-1 trimer binds to a single H3-H4 dimer, which induces a conformational rearrangement in CAF-1 promoting its interaction with substrate DNA. Two CAF-1•H3-H4 complexes co-associate on nucleosome-free DNA depositing (H3-H4)2 tetramers in the first step of nucleosome assembly. Here, we review the progress made in our understanding of CAF-1 structure, mechanism of action, and how CAF-1 contributes to chromatin dynamics during DNA replication.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2018,"['Sauer PV', 'Gu Y', 'Liu WH', 'Mattiroli F', 'Panne D', 'Luger K', 'Churchill ME']"

A hallmark of HSV-1 latency is the interaction between latent viral genomes and PML NBs, leading to the formation of viral DNA-containing PML NBs (vDCP NBs), and the complete silencing of HSV-1. Using a replication-defective HSV-1-infected human primary fibroblast model reproducing the formation of vDCP NBs, combined with an immuno-FISH approach developed to detect latent/quiescent HSV-1, we show that vDCP NBs contain both histone H3.3 and its chaperone complexes, i.e., DAXX/ATRX and HIRA complex (HIRA, UBN1, CABIN1, and ASF1a). HIRA also co-localizes with vDCP NBs present in trigeminal ganglia (TG) neurons from HSV-1-infected wild type mice. ChIP and Re-ChIP show that vDCP NBs-associated latent/quiescent viral genomes are chromatinized almost exclusively with H3.3 modified on its lysine (K) 9 by trimethylation, consistent with an interaction of the H3.3 chaperones with multiple viral loci and with the transcriptional silencing of HSV-1. Only simultaneous inactivation of both H3.3 chaperone complexes has a significant impact on the deposition of H3.3 on viral genomes, suggesting a compensation mechanism. In contrast, the sole depletion of PML significantly impacts the chromatinization of the latent/quiescent viral genomes with H3.3 without any overall replacement with H3.1. vDCP NBs-associated HSV-1 genomes are not definitively silenced since the destabilization of vDCP NBs by ICP0, which is essential for HSV-1 reactivation in vivo, allows the recovery of a transcriptional lytic program and the replication of viral genomes. Consequently, the present study demonstrates a specific chromatin regulation of vDCP NBs-associated latent/quiescent HSV-1 through an H3.3-dependent HSV-1 chromatinization involving the two H3.3 chaperones DAXX/ATRX and HIRA complexes. Additionally, the study reveals that PML NBs are major actors in latent/quiescent HSV-1 H3.3 chromatinization through a PML NB/histone H3.3/H3.3 chaperone axis.",PLoS Pathog.,2018,"['Cohen C', 'Corpet A', 'Roubille S', 'Maroui MA', 'Poccardi N', 'Rousseau A', 'Kleijwegt C', 'Binda O', 'Texier P', 'Sawtell N', 'Labetoulle M', 'Lomonte P']"
30232404,TGF-β1 promotes expression of fibrosis-related genes through the induction of histone variant H3.3 and histone chaperone HIRA.,"Renal fibrosis is a histological manifestation that occurs in almost every type of chronic kidney disease. Histone variant H3.3 and its chaperone, histone cell cycle regulation defective homolog A (HIRA), serve as epigenetic marks that regulate transcriptional activity. In this study, we assessed the roles of histone H3.3 and HIRA in unilateral ureteral-obstruction (UUO) mice. In UUO mice, the levels of histone H3.3 and HIRA were significantly upregulated in the kidneys. These upregulated levels were decreased by a TGF-β1 neutralizing antibody. TGF-β1 induced histone H3.3 and HIRA expression in vitro via a Smad3-dependent pathway in normal rat kidney (NRK)-52E cells. Additionally, knockdown of HIRA expression decreased histone H3.3 expression and fibrogenesis in NRK-52E cells after TGF-β1 stimulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that promoters of fibrosis-related genes were immunoprecipitated with both histone H3.3 and HIRA in NRK-52E cells. Lastly, in human kidney biopsies from patients diagnosed with IgA nephropathy, histone H3.3 and HIRA immunostaining correlated positively with areas of fibrosis and estimated glomerular filtration rate. In conclusion, TGF-β1 induces expression of histone H3.3 and HIRA, which regulates expression of fibrosis-related genes.",Sci Rep,2018,"['Shindo T', 'Doi S', 'Nakashima A', 'Sasaki K', 'Arihiro K', 'Masaki T']"
30232013,Genomic Location of PRMT6-Dependent H3R2 Methylation Is Linked to the Transcriptional Outcome of Associated Genes.,"Protein arginine methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6) catalyzes asymmetric dimethylation of histone H3 at arginine 2 (H3R2me2a). This mark has been reported to associate with silent genes. Here, we use a cell model of neural differentiation, which upon PRMT6 knockout exhibits proliferation and differentiation defects. Strikingly, we detect PRMT6-dependent H3R2me2a at active genes, both at promoter and enhancer sites. Loss of H3R2me2a from promoter sites leads to enhanced KMT2A binding and H3K4me3 deposition together with increased target gene transcription, supporting a repressive nature of H3R2me2a. At enhancers, H3R2me2a peaks co-localize with the active enhancer marks H3K4me1 and H3K27ac. Here, loss of H3R2me2a results in reduced KMT2D binding and H3K4me1/H3K27ac deposition together with decreased transcription of associated genes, indicating that H3R2me2a also exerts activation functions. Our work suggests that PRMT6 via H3R2me2a interferes with the deposition of adjacent histone marks and modulates the activity of important differentiation-associated genes by opposing transcriptional effects.",Cell Rep,2018,"['Bouchard C', 'Sahu P', 'Meixner M', 'Nötzold RR', 'Rust MB', 'Kremmer E', 'Feederle R', 'Hart-Smith G', 'Finkernagel F', 'Bartkuhn M', 'Savai Pullamsetti S', 'Nist A', 'Stiewe T', 'Philipsen S', 'Bauer UM']"
30230223,Mechanisms and Inhibitors of Histone Arginine Methylation.,"Histone methylation plays an important regulatory role in chromatin restructuring and RNA transcription. Arginine methylation that is enzymatically catalyzed by the family of protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) can either activate or repress gene expression depending on cellular contexts. Given the strong correlation of PRMTs with pathophysiology, great interest is seen in understanding molecular mechanisms of PRMTs in diseases and in developing potent PRMT inhibitors. Herein, we reviewed key research advances in the study of biochemical mechanisms of PRMT catalysis and their relevance to cell biology. We highlighted how a random binary, ordered ternary kinetic model for PRMT1 catalysis reconciles the literature reports and endorses a distributive mechanism that the enzyme active site utilizes for multiple turnovers of arginine methylation. We discussed the impacts of histone arginine methylation and its biochemical interplays with other key epigenetic marks. Challenges in developing small-molecule PRMT inhibitors were also discussed.",Chem Rec,2018,"['Fulton MD', 'Brown T', 'Zheng YG']"
30224647,De novo mutations in MSL3 cause an X-linked syndrome marked by impaired histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation.,"The etiological spectrum of ultra-rare developmental disorders remains to be fully defined. Chromatin regulatory mechanisms maintain cellular identity and function, where misregulation may lead to developmental defects. Here, we report pathogenic variations in MSL3, which encodes a member of the chromatin-associated male-specific lethal (MSL) complex responsible for bulk histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac) in flies and mammals. These variants cause an X-linked syndrome affecting both sexes. Clinical features of the syndrome include global developmental delay, progressive gait disturbance, and recognizable facial dysmorphism. MSL3 mutations affect MSL complex assembly and activity, accompanied by a pronounced loss of H4K16ac levels in vivo. Patient-derived cells display global transcriptome alterations of pathways involved in morphogenesis and cell migration. Finally, we use histone deacetylase inhibitors to rebalance acetylation levels, alleviating some of the molecular and cellular phenotypes of patient cells. Taken together, we characterize a syndrome that allowed us to decipher the developmental importance of MSL3 in humans.",Nat.

30221689,"DPY30 is required for the enhanced proliferation, motility and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of epithelial ovarian cancer cells.","Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is one of the most lethal gynecological malignancies and is known to be associated with the accumulation of various genetic and epigenetic alterations. As a member of the human histone‑lysine N‑methyltransferase SETD1A (SET1)/histone‑lysine N‑methyltransferase 2A (MLL) complexes that are required for full SET1/MLL methyltransferase activity, protein dpy‑30 homolog (DPY30) catalyzes histone H3K4 methylation, and its dysfunction has been associated with the occurrence of cancer. Therefore, the present study investigated the role of DPY30 in EOC and the potential association between DPY30 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of EOC. The expression of DPY30 was examined in EOC tissues and cell lines to identify any correlations between the clinicopathological characteristics of EOC and DPY30 expression, and to determine the effects of DPY30 on EOC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. DPY30 was highly expressed in EOC tissues and cell lines, and high DPY30 expression was significantly associated with notable clinicopathological variables in EOC patients, including International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage, pathological grade and lymph node metastasis. Functional studies on EOC cell lines demonstrated that DPY30 significantly promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, accelerated cell cycle progression, and promoted epithelial‑mesenchymal transition. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay results revealed that DPY30 regulates histone H3K4 modification via interaction with the vimentin gene promoter, suggesting that DPY30 promotes the transcription of vimentin. Finally, high expression of DPY30 was significantly associated with reduced survival in patients with EOC. The results indicated that DPY30 may act as an oncogene in EOC and thus represents a potential therapeutic target and prognostic marker in EOC.",Int. J. Mol.

30217978,The ZZ-type zinc finger of ZZZ3 modulates the ATAC complex-mediated histone acetylation and gene activation.,"Recognition of histones by epigenetic readers is a fundamental mechanism for the regulation of chromatin and transcription. Most reader modules target specific post-translational modifications on histones. Here, we report the identification of a reader of histone H3, the ZZ-type zinc finger (ZZ) domain of ZZZ3, a subunit of the Ada-two-A-containing (ATAC) histone acetyltransferase complex. The solution NMR structure of the ZZ in complex with the H3 peptide reveals a unique binding mechanism involving caging of the N-terminal Alanine 1 of histone H3 in an acidic cavity of the ZZ domain, indicating a specific recognition of H3 versus other histones. Depletion of ZZZ3 or disruption of the ZZ-H3 interaction dampens ATAC-dependent promoter histone H3K9 acetylation and target gene expression. Overall, our study identifies the ZZ domain of ZZZ3 as a histone H3 reader that is required for the ATAC complex-mediated maintenance of histone acetylation and gene activation.",Nat Commun,2018,"['Mi W', 'Zhang Y', 'Lyu J', 'Wang X', 'Tong Q', 'Peng D', 'Xue Y', 'Tencer AH', 'Wen H', 'Li W', 'Kutateladze TG', 'Shi X']"

30215776,Topokaryotyping demonstrates single cell variability and stress dependent variations in nuclear envelope associated domains.,"Analysis of large-scale interphase genome positioning with reference to a nuclear landmark has recently been studied using sequencing-based single cell approaches. However, these approaches are dependent upon technically challenging, time consuming and costly high throughput sequencing technologies, requiring specialized bioinformatics tools and expertise. Here, we propose a novel, affordable and robust microscopy-based single cell approach, termed Topokaryotyping, to analyze and reconstruct the interphase positioning of genomic loci relative to a given nuclear landmark, detectable as banding pattern on mitotic chromosomes. This is accomplished by proximity-dependent histone labeling, where biotin ligase BirA fused to nuclear envelope marker Emerin was coexpressed together with Biotin Acceptor Peptide (BAP)-histone fusion followed by (i) biotin labeling, (ii) generation of mitotic spreads, (iii) detection of the biotin label on mitotic chromosomes and (iv) their identification by karyotyping. Using Topokaryotyping, we identified both cooperativity and stochasticity in the positioning of emerin-associated chromatin domains in individual cells. Furthermore, the chromosome-banding pattern showed dynamic changes in emerin-associated domains upon physical and radiological stress. In summary, Topokaryotyping is a sensitive and reliable technique to quantitatively analyze spatial positioning of genomic regions interacting with a given nuclear landmark at the single cell level in various experimental conditions.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2018,"['Jurisic A', 'Robin C', 'Tarlykov P', 'Siggens L', 'Schoell B', 'Jauch A', 'Ekwall K', 'Sørensen CS', 'Lipinski M', 'Shoaib M', 'Ogryzko V']"

30212933,Comprehensive analysis of lysine crotonylation in proteome of maintenance hemodialysis patients.,"INTRODUCTION: Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) carry epigenetic information to regulate diverse cellular processes at the chromatin level. Crotonylation, one of the most important and common PTMs, plays a key role in the regulation of various biological processes. However, no study has evaluated the role of lysine crotonylation in maintenance hemodialysis patients (MHP).
METHODS: Here, we comparatively evaluated the crotonylation proteome of normal controls (NC) and MHP using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) coupled with highly sensitive immune-affinity purification.
RESULTS: A total of 1109 lysine modification sites distributed on 347 proteins were identified, including 93 and 252 crotonylated upregulated and downregulated proteins, respectively. Thus, a decrease in crotonylation of histone proteins was observed in patients with kidney failure undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. Intensive bioinformatic analysis revealed that most of the crotonylated proteins were distributed in the cytoplasm, nucleus, mitochondria, and extracellular region. Gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that the crotonylated proteins were significantly enriched in the platelet alpha granule lumen, platelet degranulation, and cell adhesion molecule binding. In addition, protein domain, including fibrinogen alpha/beta/gamma chain, zinc finger, and WD40-repeat-containing domain, were significantly enriched in crotonylated proteins. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)-based functional enrichment analysis revealed that crotonylated proteins were enriched in complement and coagulation cascades, cardiac muscle contraction, and hematopoietic cell lineage, all of which have important associations with hemodialysis complications.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on the global crotonylation proteome of MHP. Lysine crotonylation was found to play important regulatory roles in pathophysiological processes in MHP.",Medicine (Baltimore),2018,"['Chen W', 'Tang D', 'Xu Y', 'Zou Y', 'Sui W', 'Dai Y', 'Diao H']"
30209253,Histone H4K20 methylation mediated chromatin compaction threshold ensures genome integrity by limiting DNA replication licensing.,"The decompaction and re-establishment of chromatin organization immediately after mitosis is essential for genome regulation. Mechanisms underlying chromatin structure control in daughter cells are not fully understood. Here we show that a chromatin compaction threshold in cells exiting mitosis ensures genome integrity by limiting replication licensing in G1 phase. Upon mitotic exit, chromatin relaxation is controlled by SET8-dependent methylation of histone H4 on lysine 20. In the absence of either SET8 or H4K20 residue, substantial genome-wide chromatin decompaction occurs allowing excessive loading of the origin recognition complex (ORC) in the daughter cells. ORC overloading stimulates aberrant recruitment of the MCM2-7 complex that promotes single-stranded DNA formation and DNA damage. Restoring chromatin compaction restrains excess replication licensing and loss of genome integrity. Our findings identify a cell cycle-specific mechanism whereby fine-tuned chromatin relaxation suppresses excessive detrimental replication licensing and maintains genome integrity at the cellular transition from mitosis to G1 phase.",Nat Commun,2018,"['Shoaib M', 'Walter D', 'Gillespie PJ', 'Izard F', 'Fahrenkrog B', 'Lleres D', 'Lerdrup M', 'Johansen JV', 'Hansen K', 'Julien E', 'Blow JJ', 'Sørensen CS']"
30202049,BAP1 links metabolic regulation of ferroptosis to tumour suppression.,"The roles and regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis (a non-apoptotic form of cell death) in cancer remain unclear. The tumour suppressor BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) encodes a nuclear deubiquitinating enzyme to reduce histone 2A ubiquitination (H2Aub) on chromatin. Here, integrated transcriptomic, epigenomic and cancer genomic analyses link BAP1 to metabolism-related biological processes, and identify cystine transporter SLC7A11 as a key BAP1 target gene in human cancers. Functional studies reveal that BAP1 decreases H2Aub occupancy on the SLC7A11 promoter and represses SLC7A11 expression in a deubiquitinating-dependent manner, and that BAP1 inhibits cystine uptake by repressing SLC7A11 expression, leading to elevated lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Furthermore, we show that BAP1 inhibits tumour development partly through SLC7A11 and ferroptosis, and that cancer-associated BAP1 mutants lose their abilities to repress SLC7A11 and to promote ferroptosis. Together, our results uncover a previously unappreciated epigenetic mechanism coupling ferroptosis to tumour suppression.",Nat.

30190472,The biological significance of histone modifiers in multiple myeloma: clinical applications.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal plasma cell disorder that is characterized by a variety of genetic alterations. Recent studies have highlighted not only the importance of these genetic events but also epigenetic aberrations including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs in the biology of MM. Post-translational modifications of histone, such as methylation and acetylation, contribute to chromatin dynamics, and are modulated by histone modifying enzymes, and dysregulation of these enzymes is implicated in the pathogenesis of cancers, including MM. Histone modifiers also have non-histone substrates and enzymatically independent roles, which are also involved in tumorigenesis. Here we review and provide comprehensive insight into the biologic significance of histone methyl- and acetyl-modifiers in MM, and further provide an overview of the clinical applications of histone modifier inhibitors, especially histone deacetylase inhibitors. These findings underline the emerging roles of histone modifiers in the pathogenesis of MM, and further highlight the possibility of novel epigenetic therapies in MM.",Blood Cancer J,2018,"['Ohguchi H', 'Hideshima T', 'Anderson KC']"
30183076,Histone demethylase KDM7A controls androgen receptor activity and tumor growth in prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer can be controlled by androgen-hormone treatment until the cancer becomes refractory. It is believed that hormone sensitivity is largely dependent on androgen receptor (AR) activity. Here, we found the histone demethylase KDM7A which demethylates histone H3K27 to be overexpressed in enzalutamide resistant castration-resistant prostate cancer cell line C4-2b, and investigated the molecular mechanism whereby androgen receptor activity is regulated by KDM7A. We engineered AR-positive LNCaP cells to stably express a short-hairpin RNA against KDM7A mRNA from a lentiviral vector. By measuring AR downstream gene expression after androgen stimulation, we found that a KDM7A-deficient cell line showed lower AR downstream gene expression compared to a control cell. KDM7A knock-down in LNCaP cell line caused decreased cell proliferation. Western blot analysis with modified-histone antibody revealed that the KDM7A-knock-down LNCaP cell line had increased H3K27 di-methylation. We confirmed KDM7A binding on AR target-gene promoters after hormone stimulation in chromatin-immunoprecipitation experiments. And increased H3K27 di-methylation was observed in KDM7A knock-down LNCaP stable cell. Treatment with KDM7A inhibitor, TC-E 5002, reduced proliferation and induced apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. Finally, we observed that the KDM7A protein was significantly upregulated in prostate cancer tissue, and that this difference correlated with the Gleason score. These data suggested that KDM7A is potentially a good therapeutic target for prostate cancer drugs and can be used as potentially a good prognostic indicator for prostate cancer and related treatment strategies.",Int.

30181605,Local enrichment of HP1alpha at telomeres alters their structure and regulation of telomere protection.,"Enhanced telomere maintenance is evident in malignant cancers. While telomeres are thought to be inherently heterochromatic, detailed mechanisms of how epigenetic modifications impact telomere protection and structures are largely unknown in human cancers. Here we develop a molecular tethering approach to experimentally enrich heterochromatin protein HP1α specifically at telomeres. This results in increased deposition of H3K9me3 at cancer cell telomeres. Telomere extension by telomerase is attenuated, and damage-induced foci at telomeres are reduced, indicating augmentation of telomere stability. Super-resolution STORM imaging shows an unexpected increase in irregularity of telomeric structure. Telomere-tethered chromo shadow domain (CSD) mutant I165A of HP1α abrogates both the inhibition of telomere extension and the irregularity of telomeric structure, suggesting the involvement of at least one HP1α-ligand in mediating these effects. This work presents an approach to specifically manipulate the epigenetic status locally at telomeres to uncover insights into molecular mechanisms underlying telomere structural dynamics.",Nat Commun,2018,"['Chow TT', 'Shi X', 'Wei JH', 'Guan J', 'Stadler G', 'Huang B', 'Blackburn EH']"
30181289,Cancer-driving H3G34V/R/D mutations block H3K36 methylation and H3K36me3-MutSα interaction.,"Somatic mutations on glycine 34 of histone H3 (H3G34) cause pediatric cancers, but the underlying oncogenic mechanism remains unknown. We demonstrate that substituting H3G34 with arginine, valine, or aspartate (H3G34R/V/D), which converts the non-side chain glycine to a large side chain-containing residue, blocks H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) dimethylation and trimethylation by histone methyltransferases, including SETD2, an H3K36-specific trimethyltransferase. Our structural analysis reveals that the H3 ""G33-G34"" motif is recognized by a narrow substrate channel, and that H3G34/R/V/D mutations impair the catalytic activity of SETD2 due to steric clashes that impede optimal SETD2-H3K36 interaction. H3G34R/V/D mutations also block H3K36me3 from interacting with mismatch repair (MMR) protein MutSα, preventing the recruitment of the MMR machinery to chromatin. Cells harboring H3G34R/V/D mutations display a mutator phenotype similar to that observed in MMR-defective cells. Therefore, H3G34R/V/D mutations promote genome instability and tumorigenesis by inhibiting MMR activity.",Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

30181240,The pseudokinase MLKL activates PAD4-dependent NET formation in necroptotic neutrophils.,"Neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation can generate short-term, functional anucleate cytoplasts and trigger loss of cell viability. We demonstrated that the necroptotic cell death effector mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) translocated from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane and stimulated downstream NADPH oxidase-independent ROS production, loss of cytoplasmic granules, breakdown of the nuclear membrane, chromatin decondensation, histone hypercitrullination, and extrusion of bacteriostatic NETs. This process was coordinated by receptor-interacting protein kinase-1 (RIPK1), which activated the caspase-8-dependent apoptotic or RIPK3/MLKL-dependent necroptotic death of mouse and human neutrophils. Genetic deficiency of RIPK3 and MLKL prevented NET formation but did not prevent cell death, which was because of residual caspase-8-dependent activity. Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) was activated downstream of RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL and was required for maximal histone hypercitrullination and NET extrusion. This work defines a distinct signaling network that activates PAD4-dependent NET release for the control of methicillin-resistant ",Sci Signal,2018,"[""D'Cruz AA"", 'Speir M', 'Bliss-Moreau M', 'Dietrich S', 'Wang S', 'Chen AA', 'Gavillet M', 'Al-Obeidi A', 'Lawlor KE', 'Vince JE', 'Kelliher MA', 'Hakem R', 'Pasparakis M', 'Williams DA', 'Ericsson M', 'Croker BA']"

However, the potential of implicating social epigenomics in improving health and health related policies is tremendous. Epidemiologic studies evaluating social, behavior, family, and environmental factors have helped understand social inequality and develop the area of social epigenomics.

30177573,Evidence for the nuclear import of histones H3.1 and H4 as monomers.,"Newly synthesised histones are thought to dimerise in the cytosol and undergo nuclear import in complex with histone chaperones. Here, we provide evidence that human H3.1 and H4 are imported into the nucleus as monomers. Using a tether-and-release system to study the import dynamics of newly synthesised histones, we find that cytosolic H3.1 and H4 can be maintained as stable monomeric units. Cytosolically tethered histones are bound to importin-alpha proteins (predominantly IPO4), but not to histone-specific chaperones NASP, ASF1a, RbAp46 (RBBP7) or HAT1, which reside in the nucleus in interphase cells. Release of monomeric histones from their cytosolic tether results in rapid nuclear translocation, IPO4 dissociation and incorporation into chromatin at sites of replication. Quantitative analysis of histones bound to individual chaperones reveals an excess of H3 specifically associated with sNASP, suggesting that NASP maintains a soluble, monomeric pool of H3 within the nucleus and may act as a nuclear receptor for newly imported histone. In summary, we propose that histones H3 and H4 are rapidly imported as monomeric units, forming heterodimers in the nucleus rather than the cytosol.",EMBO J.,2018,"['Apta-Smith MJ', 'Hernandez-Fernaud JR', 'Bowman AJ']"
30176939,Epigenomics of mammary gland development.,"Differentiation of stem cells into highly specialised cells requires gene expression changes brought about by remodelling of the chromatin architecture. During this lineage-commitment process, the majority of DNA needs to be packaged into inactive heterochromatin, allowing only a subset of regulatory elements to remain open and functionally required genes to be expressed. Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, post-translational modifications to histone tails, and nucleosome positioning all potentially contribute to the changes in higher order chromatin structure during differentiation. The mammary gland is a particularly useful model to study these complex epigenetic processes since the majority of its development is postnatal, the gland is easily accessible, and development occurs in a highly reproducible manner. Inappropriate epigenetic remodelling can also drive tumourigenesis; thus, insights into epigenetic remodelling during mammary gland development advance our understanding of breast cancer aetiology.

30176808,HebbPlot: an intelligent tool for learning and visualizing chromatin mark signatures.,"BACKGROUND: Histone modifications play important roles in gene regulation, heredity, imprinting, and many human diseases. The histone code is complex and consists of more than 100 marks. Therefore, biologists need computational tools to characterize general signatures representing the distributions of tens of chromatin marks around thousands of regions.
RESULTS: To this end, we developed a software tool, HebbPlot, which utilizes a Hebbian neural network in learning a general chromatin signature from regions with a common function. Hebbian networks can learn the associations between tens of marks and thousands of regions. HebbPlot presents a signature as a digital image, which can be easily interpreted. Moreover, signatures produced by HebbPlot can be compared quantitatively. We validated HebbPlot in six case studies. The results of these case studies are novel or validating results already reported in the literature, indicating the accuracy of HebbPlot. Our results indicate that promoters have a directional chromatin signature; several marks tend to stretch downstream or upstream. H3K4me3 and H3K79me2 have clear directional distributions around active promoters. In addition, the signatures of high- and low-CpG promoters are different; H3K4me3, H3K9ac, and H3K27ac are the most different marks. When we studied the signatures of enhancers active in eight tissues, we observed that these signatures are similar, but not identical. Further, we identified some histone modifications - H3K36me3, H3K79me1, H3K79me2, and H4K8ac - that are associated with coding regions of active genes. Other marks - H4K12ac, H3K14ac, H3K27me3, and H2AK5ac - were found to be weakly associated with coding regions of inactive genes.
CONCLUSIONS: This study resulted in a novel software tool, HebbPlot, for learning and visualizing the chromatin signature of a genetic element. Using HebbPlot, we produced a visual catalog of the signatures of multiple genetic elements in 57 cell types available through the Roadmap Epigenomics Project. Furthermore, we made a progress toward a functional catalog consisting of 22 histone marks. In sum, HebbPlot is applicable to a wide array of studies, facilitating the deciphering of the histone code.",BMC Bioinformatics,2018,"['Girgis HZ', 'Velasco A', 'Reyes ZE']"
30174306,Short-Term Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore Opening Modulates Histone Lysine Methylation at the Early Phase of Somatic Cell Reprogramming.,"Reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells reconfigures chromatin modifications. Whether and how this process is regulated by signals originating in the mitochondria remain unknown. Here we show that the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), a key regulator of mitochondrial homeostasis, undergoes short-term opening during the early phase of reprogramming and that this transient activation enhances reprogramming. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, greater mPTP opening correlates with higher reprogramming efficiency. The reprogramming-promoting function of mPTP opening is mediated by plant homeodomain finger protein 8 (PHF8) demethylation of H3K9me2 and H3K27me3, leading to reduction in their occupancies at the promoter regions of pluripotency genes. mPTP opening increases PHF8 protein levels downstream of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and miR-101c and simultaneously elevates levels of PHF8's cofactor, α-ketoglutarate. Our findings represent a novel mitochondria-to-nucleus pathway in cell fate determination by mPTP-mediated epigenetic regulation.",Cell Metab.,2018,"['Ying Z', 'Xiang G', 'Zheng L', 'Tang H', 'Duan L', 'Lin X', 'Zhao Q', 'Chen K', 'Wu Y', 'Xing G', 'Lv Y', 'Li L', 'Yang L', 'Bao F', 'Long Q', 'Zhou Y', 'He X', 'Wang Y', 'Gao M', 'Pei D', 'Chan WY', 'Liu X']"
30166706,CELL FATE DETERMINATION IN 3D: REGULATION OF GENE EXPRESSION VIA CHROMATIN INTERACTIONS WITH THE NUCLEAR MEMBRANE.,"In the nucleus of all cells, DNA is packaged in association with histone proteins to form chromatin. It is becoming increasingly clear that the organization of chromatin in three dimensions within the nucleus is highly regulated and can contribute to gene expression and cell function. The regions of the genome that are near the nuclear periphery are termed ""lamin associated domains"" or LADs (1-3). Here, I present a theory, based on recent results, for ""chromatin competence"" in which the organization of LADs in a progenitor cell accounts for the ability of that cell to respond to external factors to promote differentiation into one lineage or another. I propose that a cell can only respond to an inductive cue if the downstream genes are available for activation, and that genes are not available for activation if they are sequestered in LADs.",Trans.

30166406,Study of mitotic chromatin supports a model of bookmarking by histone modifications and reveals nucleosome deposition patterns.,"Mitosis encompasses key molecular changes including chromatin condensation, nuclear envelope breakdown, and reduced transcription levels. Immediately after mitosis, the interphase chromatin structure is reestablished and transcription resumes. The reestablishment of the interphase chromatin is probably achieved by ""bookmarking,"" i.e., the retention of at least partial information during mitosis. To gain a deeper understanding of the contribution of histone modifications to the mitotic bookmarking process, we merged proteomics, immunofluorescence, and ChIP-seq approaches. We focused on key histone modifications and employed HeLa-S3 cells as a model system. Generally, in spite of the general hypoacetylation observed during mitosis, we observed a global concordance between the genomic organization of histone modifications in interphase and mitosis, suggesting that the epigenomic landscape may serve as a component of the mitotic bookmarking process. Next, we investigated the nucleosome that enters nucleosome depleted regions (NDRs) during mitosis. We observed that in ∼60% of the NDRs, the entering nucleosome is distinct from the surrounding highly acetylated nucleosomes and appears to have either low levels of acetylation or high levels of phosphorylation in adjacent residues (since adjacent phosphorylation may interfere with the ability to detect acetylation). Inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) by the small molecule TSA reverts this pattern, suggesting that these nucleosomes are specifically deacetylated during mitosis. Altogether, by merging multiple approaches, our study provides evidence to support a model where histone modifications may play a role in mitotic bookmarking and uncovers new insights into the deposition of nucleosomes during mitosis.",Genome Res.,2018,"['Javasky E', 'Shamir I', 'Gandhi S', 'Egri S', 'Sandler O', 'Rothbart SB', 'Kaplan N', 'Jaffe JD', 'Goren A', 'Simon I']"
30165676,Replication-dependent histone isoforms: a new source of complexity in chromatin structure and function.,"Replication-dependent histones are expressed in a cell cycle regulated manner and supply the histones necessary to support DNA replication. In mammals, the replication-dependent histones are encoded by a family of genes that are located in several clusters. In humans, these include 16 genes for histone H2A, 22 genes for histone H2B, 14 genes for histone H3, 14 genes for histone H4 and 6 genes for histone H1. While the proteins encoded by these genes are highly similar, they are not identical. For many years, these genes were thought to encode functionally equivalent histone proteins. However, several lines of evidence have emerged that suggest that the replication-dependent histone genes can have specific functions and may constitute a novel layer of chromatin regulation. This Survey and Summary reviews the literature on replication-dependent histone isoforms and discusses potential mechanisms by which the small variations in primary sequence between the isoforms can alter chromatin function. In addition, we summarize the wealth of data implicating altered regulation of histone isoform expression in cancer.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2018,"['Singh R', 'Bassett E', 'Chakravarti A', 'Parthun MR']"

30154440,CFP1 coordinates histone H3 lysine-4 trimethylation and meiotic cell cycle progression in mouse oocytes.,"Trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine-4 (H3K4me3) is associated with gene-regulatory elements, but its transcription-independent function in cell division is unclear. CxxC-finger protein-1 (CFP1) is a major mediator of H3K4 trimethylation in mouse oocytes. Here we report that oocyte-specific knockout of Cxxc1, inhibition of CFP1 function, or abrogation of H3K4 methylation in oocytes each causes a delay of meiotic resumption as well as metaphase I arrest owing to defective spindle assembly and chromosome misalignment. These phenomena are partially attributed to insufficient phosphorylation of histone H3 at threonine-3. CDK1 triggers cell division-coupled degradation and inhibitory phosphorylation of CFP1. Preventing CFP1 degradation and phosphorylation causes CFP1 accumulation on chromosomes and impairs meiotic maturation and preimplantation embryo development. Therefore, CFP1-mediated H3K4 trimethylation provides 3a permission signal for the G2-M transition. Dual inhibition of CFP1 removes the SETD1-CFP1 complex from chromatin and ensures appropriate chromosome configuration changes during meiosis and mitosis.",Nat Commun,2018,"['Sha QQ', 'Dai XX', 'Jiang JC', 'Yu C', 'Jiang Y', 'Liu J', 'Ou XH', 'Zhang SY', 'Fan HY']"
30150385,Methylglyoxal-derived posttranslational arginine modifications are abundant histone marks.,"Histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) regulate chromatin dynamics, DNA accessibility, and transcription to expand the genetic code. Many of these PTMs are produced through cellular metabolism to offer both feedback and feedforward regulation. Herein we describe the existence of Lys and Arg modifications on histones by a glycolytic by-product, methylglyoxal (MGO). Our data demonstrate that adduction of histones by MGO is an abundant modification, present at the same order of magnitude as Arg methylation. These modifications were detected on all four core histones at critical residues involved in both nucleosome stability and reader domain binding. In addition, MGO treatment of cells lacking the major detoxifying enzyme, glyoxalase 1, results in marked disruption of H2B acetylation and ubiquitylation without affecting H2A, H3, and H4 modifications. Using RNA sequencing, we show that MGO is capable of altering gene transcription, most notably in cells lacking GLO1. Finally, we show that the deglycase DJ-1 protects histones from adduction by MGO. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the existence of a previously undetected histone modification derived from glycolysis, which may have far-reaching implications for the control of gene expression and protein transcription linked to metabolism.",Proc.

30150059,Androgen receptor drives hepatocellular carcinogenesis by activating enhancer of zeste homolog 2-mediated Wnt/β-catenin signaling.,"BACKGROUND: Androgen receptor (AR) plays a crucial role as a transcription factor in promoting the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) which is prone to aberrant chromatin modifications. However, the regulatory effects of AR on epigenetic mediators in HCC remain ill-defined. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), an oncogene responsible for the tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), was identified to be overexpressed in approximate 70-90% of HCC cases, which prompted us to investigate whether or how AR regulates EZH2 expression.
METHODS: Colony formation, soft agar assay, xenograft and orthotopic mouse models were used to determine cell proliferation and tumorigenicity of gene-manipulated HCC cells. Gene regulation was assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase reporter assay, quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting. Clinical relevance of candidate proteins in patient specimens was examined in terms of pathological parameters and postsurgical survival rates.
FINDINGS: In this study, we found that AR upregulated EZH2 expression by binding to EZH2 promoter and stimulating its transcriptional activity. EZH2 overexpression increased H3K27me3 levels and thereby silenced the expression of Wnt signal inhibitors, resulting in activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and subsequently induction of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. In a cohort of human HCC patients, concordant overexpression of AR, EZH2, H3K27me3 and active β-catenin was observed in tumor tissues compared with paired non-tumor tissues, which correlated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. These findings demonstrate a novel working model in which EZH2 mediates AR-induced Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation through epigenetic modification, and support the application of EZH2-targeted reagents for treating HCC patients.",EBioMedicine,2018,"['Song H', 'Yu Z', 'Sun X', 'Feng J', 'Yu Q', 'Khan H', 'Zhu X', 'Huang L', 'Li M', 'Mok MTS', 'Cheng ASL', 'Gao Y', 'Feng H']"
30144132,Histone Lysine and Genomic Targets of Histone Acetyltransferases in Mammals.,"Histone acetylation has been recognized as an important post-translational modification of core nucleosomal histones that changes access to the chromatin to allow gene transcription, DNA replication, and repair. Histone acetyltransferases were initially identified as co-activators that link DNA-binding transcription factors to the general transcriptional machinery. Over the years, more chromatin-binding modes have been discovered suggesting direct interaction of histone acetyltransferases and their protein complex partners with histone proteins. While much progress has been made in characterizing histone acetyltransferase complexes biochemically, cell-free activity assay results are often at odds with in-cell histone acetyltransferase activities. In-cell studies suggest specific histone lysine targets, but broad recruitment modes, apparently not relying on specific DNA sequences, but on chromatin of a specific functional state. Here we review the evidence for general versus specific roles of individual nuclear lysine acetyltransferases in light of in vivo and in vitro data in the mammalian system.",Bioessays,2018,"['Voss AK', 'Thomas T']"
30143676,Integrative epigenomic analysis in differentiated human primary bronchial epithelial cells exposed to cigarette smoke.,"Cigarette smoke (CS) is one of the major risk factors for many pulmonary diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. The first line of defense for CS exposure is the bronchial epithelial cells. Elucidation of the epigenetic changes during CS exposure is key to gaining a mechanistic understanding into how mature and differentiated bronchial epithelial cells respond to CS. Therefore, we performed epigenomic profiling in conjunction with transcriptional profiling in well-differentiated human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells cultured in air-liquid interface (ALI) exposed to the vapor phase of CS. The genome-wide enrichment of histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation was detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) in HBE cells and suggested the plausible binding of specific transcription factors related to CS exposure. Additionally, interrogation of ChIP-Seq data with gene expression profiling of HBE cells after CS exposure for different durations (3 hours, 2 days, 4 days) suggested that earlier epigenetic changes (3 hours after CS exposure) may be associated with later gene expression changes induced by CS exposure (4 days). The integration of epigenetics and gene expression data revealed signaling pathways related to CS-induced epigenetic changes in HBE cells that may identify novel regulatory pathways related to CS-induced COPD.",Sci Rep,2018,"['Glass K', 'Thibault D', 'Guo F', 'Mitchel JA', 'Pham B', 'Qiu W', 'Li Y', 'Jiang Z', 'Castaldi PJ', 'Silverman EK', 'Raby B', 'Park JA', 'Yuan GC', 'Zhou X']"

It is established that EBNA3C interacts with the cellular factor RBPJ (RBP-Jκ or CBF1) through two distinct motifs: the TFGC motif, also called the homology domain (HD) motif, and the VWTP motif. In this study, we investigated the role of each motif in EBNA3C transcriptional repression activity by using two novel recombinant viruses with single RBPJ interaction motifs mutated (EBNA3C HDmut and EBNA3C W227S). Infection of primary B cells with either of these recombinant EBVs led to the successful establishment of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Gene expression analysis showed that full repression of EBNA3C target genes is not achieved by EBNA3C HDmut compared to that with EBNA3C W227S or the EBNA3C wild type (WT).

30134203,Epigenetic Changes Associated with the Expression of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Causing Genes.,"Neurodegenerative disorders, including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), have been associated to alterations in chromatin structure resulting in long-lasting changes in gene expression. ALS is predominantly a sporadic disease and environmental triggers may be involved in its onset. In this respect, alterations in the epigenome can provide the key to transform the genetic information into phenotype. In this paper, we demonstrate that two modifications associated with transcriptional activation, namely dimethylation of lysine 4 on H3 tail (H3K4me2) and phospho-acetylation of serine 10 and lysine 14 on H3 tail (H3K14ac-S10ph), and two modifications associated to transcriptional repression, namely trimethylation of lysine 9 on H3 tail (H3K9me3) and DNA methylation are selectively altered in cellular and animal model of ALS.

30126190,Food Bioactive HDAC Inhibitors in the Epigenetic Regulation of Heart Failure.,"Approximately 5.7 million U.S. adults have been diagnosed with heart failure (HF). More concerning is that one in nine U.S. deaths included HF as a contributing cause. Current HF drugs (e.g., β-blockers, ACEi) target intracellular signaling cascades downstream of cell surface receptors to prevent cardiac pump dysfunction. However, these drugs fail to target other redundant intracellular signaling pathways and, therefore, limit drug efficacy. As such, it has been postulated that compounds designed to target shared downstream mediators of these signaling pathways would be more efficacious for the treatment of HF. Histone deacetylation has been linked as a key pathogenetic element for the development of HF. Lysine residues undergo diverse and reversible post-translational modifications that include acetylation and have historically been studied as epigenetic modifiers of histone tails within chromatin that provide an important mechanism for regulating gene expression. Of recent, bioactive compounds within our diet have been linked to the regulation of gene expression, in part, through regulation of the epi-genome. It has been reported that food bioactives regulate histone acetylation via direct regulation of writer (histone acetyl transferases, HATs) and eraser (histone deacetylases, HDACs) proteins. Therefore, bioactive food compounds offer unique therapeutic strategies as epigenetic modifiers of heart failure. This review will highlight food bio-actives as modifiers of histone deacetylase activity in the heart.",Nutrients,2018,"['Evans LW', 'Ferguson BS']"

Besides, with the involvement of epigenetics in cancer, these enzymes and protein domains provide new targets for cancer drug development.

30122534,Histone Ubiquitination by the DNA Damage Response Is Required for Efficient DNA Replication in Unperturbed S Phase.,"Chromatin ubiquitination by the ubiquitin ligase RNF168 is critical to regulate the DNA damage response (DDR). DDR deficiencies lead to cancer-prone syndromes, but whether this reflects DNA repair defects is still elusive. We identified key factors of the RNF168 pathway as essential mediators of efficient DNA replication in unperturbed S phase. We found that loss of RNF168 leads to reduced replication fork progression and to reversed fork accumulation, particularly evident at repetitive sequences stalling replication. Slow fork progression depends on MRE11-dependent degradation of reversed forks, implicating RNF168 in reversed fork protection and restart. Consistent with regular nucleosomal organization of reversed forks, the replication function of RNF168 requires H2A ubiquitination. As this novel function is shared with the key DDR players ATM, γH2A.X, RNF8, and 53BP1, we propose that double-stranded ends at reversed forks engage classical DDR factors, suggesting an alternative function of this pathway in preventing genome instability and human disease.",Mol.

30122154,Sporadic DUX4 expression in FSHD myocytes is associated with incomplete repression by the PRC2 complex and gain of H3K9 acetylation on the contracted D4Z4 allele.,"BACKGROUND: Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy 1 (FSHD1) has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and primarily affects skeletal muscle. The genetic cause of FSHD1 is contraction of the D4Z4 macrosatellite array on chromosome 4 alleles associated with a permissive haplotype causing infrequent sporadic expression of the DUX4 gene. Epigenetically, the contracted D4Z4 array has decreased cytosine methylation and an open chromatin structure. Despite these genetic and epigenetic changes, the majority of FSHD myoblasts are able to repress DUX4 transcription. In this study we hypothesized that histone modifications distinguish DUX4 expressing and non-expressing cells from the same individuals.
RESULTS: FSHD myocytes containing the permissive 4qA haplotype with a long terminal D4Z4 unit were sorted into DUX4 expressing and non-expressing groups. We found similar CpG hypomethylation between the groups of FSHD-affected cells suggesting that CpG hypomethylation is not sufficient to trigger DUX4 expression. A survey of histone modifications present at the D4Z4 region during cell lineage commitment revealed that this region is bivalent in FSHD iPS cells with both H3K4me3 activating and H3K27me3 repressive marks present, making D4Z4 poised for DUX4 activation in pluripotent cells. After lineage commitment, the D4Z4 region becomes univalent with H3K27me3 in FSHD and non-FSHD control myoblasts and a concomitant increase in H3K4me3 in a small fraction of cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) for histone modifications, chromatin modifier proteins and chromatin structural proteins on sorted FSHD myocytes revealed that activating H3K9Ac modifications were ~ fourfold higher in DUX4 expressing FSHD myocytes, while the repressive H3K27me3 modification was ~ fourfold higher at the permissive allele in DUX4 non-expressing FSHD myocytes from the same cultures. Similarly, we identified EZH2, a member of the polycomb repressive complex involved in H3K27 methylation, to be present more frequently on the permissive allele in DUX4 non-expressing FSHD myocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: These results implicate PRC2 as the complex primarily responsible for DUX4 repression in the setting of FSHD and H3K9 acetylation along with reciprocal loss of H3K27me3 as key epigenetic events that result in DUX4 expression. Future studies focused on events that trigger H3K9Ac or augment PRC2 complex activity in a small fraction of nuclei may expose additional drug targets worthy of study.",Epigenetics Chromatin,2018,"['Haynes P', 'Bomsztyk K', 'Miller DG']"
30112853,Defects in centromeric/pericentromeric histone H2A T120 phosphorylation by hBUB1 cause chromosome missegregation producing multinucleated cells.,"Histone H2A phosphorylation plays a role both in chromatin condensation during mitosis and in transcriptional activation during the G1/S transition. Bub1 and NHK1/VRK1 have been identified as histone H2A kinases. However, little is known about the importance of histone H2A phosphorylation in chromosome segregation. Here, we expressed recombinant hBUB1 and confirmed that it phosphorylates histone H2A T120 in the in vitro-assembled nucleosome. Knockdown (KD) of BUB1 decreases bulk H2A T120 phosphorylation in HeLa cells, whereas hBUB1 is upregulated during mitosis, which corresponds with H2A T120 phosphorylation. ChIP-qPCR of the DXZ1 centromeric and γ-ALR pericentromeric region showed that BUB1 localizes to this region and increases local H2A T120 phosphorylation during M phase. BUB1 KD did not induce apoptosis but increased the M phase cell population, as detected by flow cytometry. BUB1 KD also caused an abnormal metaphase and telophase, resulting in multinucleated cells and impaired cancer cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Over-expression of the histone H2A T120D or T120E mutations, which mimic phosphorylated threonine, decreased the number of multinucleated cells caused by BUB1 KD. These results strengthen the apparent importance of BUB1-mediated H2A T120 phosphorylation in normal mitosis.",Genes Cells,2018,"['Maeda K', 'Yoneda M', 'Nakagawa T', 'Ikeda K', 'Higashi M', 'Nakagawa K', 'Miyakoda M', 'Yui K', 'Oda H', 'Inoue S', 'Ito T']"

Here, we use a chemical genetics approach to acutely block the function of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) binding protein (CBP)/P300 bromodomain in models of hematological malignancies and describe a consequent loss of H3K27Ac specifically from enhancers, despite the continued presence of CBP/P300 at chromatin.

Here we report the functional properties of nuclear IL-33. Overexpression of IL-33 does not alter global gene expression in transduced epithelial cells. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching data show that the intranuclear mobility of IL-33 is ~10-fold slower than IL-1α, whereas truncated IL-33 lacking chromatin-binding activity is more mobile. WT IL-33 is more resistant to necrosis-induced release than truncated IL-33 and has a relatively slow, linear release over time after membrane dissolution as compared to truncated IL-33 or IL-1α. Lastly, IL-33 and histones are released as a high-molecular weight complex and synergistically activate receptor-mediated signaling. We thus propose that chromatin binding is a post-translational mechanism that regulates the releasability and ST2-mediated bioactivity of IL-33 and provide a paradigm to further understand the enigmatic functions of nuclear cytokines.",Nat Commun,2018,"['Travers J', 'Rochman M', 'Miracle CE', 'Habel JE', 'Brusilovsky M', 'Caldwell JM', 'Rymer JK', 'Rothenberg ME']"
30104678,PARP2 mediates branched poly ADP-ribosylation in response to DNA damage.,"Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) is a posttranslational modification involved in multiple biological processes, including DNA damage repair. This modification is catalyzed by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family of enzymes. PARylation is composed of both linear and branched polymers of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR). However, the biochemical mechanism of polymerization and biological functions of branched PAR chains are elusive. Here we show that PARP2 is preferentially activated by PAR and subsequently catalyzes branched PAR chain synthesis. Notably, the direct binding to PAR by the N-terminus of PARP2 promotes the enzymatic activity of PARP2 toward the branched PAR chain synthesis. Moreover, the PBZ domain of APLF recognizes the branched PAR chain and regulates chromatin remodeling to DNA damage response. This unique feature of PAR-dependent PARP2 activation and subsequent PARylation mediates the participation of PARP2 in DNA damage repair. Thus, our results reveal an important molecular mechanism of branched PAR synthesis and a key biological function of branched PARylation.",Nat Commun,2018,"['Chen Q', 'Kassab MA', 'Dantzer F', 'Yu X']"
30104407,Histone H2A-H2B binding by Pol α in the eukaryotic replisome contributes to the maintenance of repressive chromatin.,"The eukaryotic replisome disassembles parental chromatin at DNA replication forks, but then plays a poorly understood role in the re-deposition of the displaced histone complexes onto nascent DNA. Here, we show that yeast DNA polymerase α contains a histone-binding motif that is conserved in human Pol α and is specific for histones H2A and H2B. Mutation of this motif in budding yeast cells does not affect DNA synthesis, but instead abrogates gene silencing at telomeres and mating-type loci. Similar phenotypes are produced not only by mutations that displace Pol α from the replisome, but also by mutation of the previously identified histone-binding motif in the CMG helicase subunit Mcm2, the human orthologue of which was shown to bind to histones H3 and H4. We show that chromatin-derived histone complexes can be bound simultaneously by Mcm2, Pol α and the histone chaperone FACT that is also a replisome component. These findings indicate that replisome assembly unites multiple histone-binding activities, which jointly process parental histones to help preserve silent chromatin during the process of chromosome duplication.",EMBO J.,2018,"['Evrin C', 'Maman JD', 'Diamante A', 'Pellegrini L', 'Labib K']"
30104358,Chromatin structure and its chemical modifications regulate the ubiquitin ligase substrate selectivity of UHRF1.,"Mitotic inheritance of DNA methylation patterns is facilitated by UHRF1, a DNA- and histone-binding E3 ubiquitin ligase that helps recruit the maintenance DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 to replicating chromatin. The DNA methylation maintenance function of UHRF1 is dependent on its ability to bind chromatin, where it facilitates monoubiquitination of histone H3 at lysines 18 and 23, a docking site for DNMT1. Because of technical limitations, this model of UHRF1-dependent DNA methylation inheritance has been constructed largely based on genetics and biochemical observations querying methylated DNA oligonucleotides, synthetic histone peptides, and heterogeneous chromatin extracted from cells. Here, we construct semisynthetic mononucleosomes harboring defined histone and DNA modifications and perform rigorous analysis of UHRF1 binding and enzymatic activity with these reagents. We show that multivalent engagement of nucleosomal linker DNA and dimethylated lysine 9 on histone H3 directs UHRF1 ubiquitin ligase activity toward histone substrates. Notably, we reveal a molecular switch, stimulated by recognition of hemimethylated DNA, which redirects UHRF1 ubiquitin ligase activity away from histones in favor of robust autoubiquitination. Our studies support a noncompetitive model for UHRF1 and DNMT1 chromatin recruitment to replicating chromatin and define a role for hemimethylated linker DNA as a regulator of UHRF1 ubiquitin ligase substrate selectivity.",Proc.

30102379,Chromatin-dependent allosteric regulation of DNMT3A activity by MeCP2.,"Despite their central importance in mammalian development, the mechanisms that regulate the DNA methylation machinery and thereby the generation of genomic methylation patterns are still poorly understood. Here, we identify the 5mC-binding protein MeCP2 as a direct and strong interactor of DNA methyltransferase 3 (DNMT3) proteins. We mapped the interaction interface to the transcriptional repression domain of MeCP2 and the ADD domain of DNMT3A and find that binding of MeCP2 strongly inhibits the activity of DNMT3A in vitro. This effect was reinforced by cellular studies where a global reduction of DNA methylation levels was observed after overexpression of MeCP2 in human cells. By engineering conformationally locked DNMT3A variants as novel tools to study the allosteric regulation of this enzyme, we show that MeCP2 stabilizes the closed, autoinhibitory conformation of DNMT3A. Interestingly, the interaction with MeCP2 and its resulting inhibition were relieved by the binding of K4 unmodified histone H3 N-terminal tail to the DNMT3A-ADD domain. Taken together, our data indicate that the localization and activity of DNMT3A are under the combined control of MeCP2 and H3 tail modifications where, depending on the modification status of the H3 tail at the binding sites, MeCP2 can act as either a repressor or activator of DNA methylation.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2018,"['Rajavelu A', 'Lungu C', 'Emperle M', 'Dukatz M', 'Bröhm A', 'Broche J', 'Hanelt I', 'Parsa E', 'Schiffers S', 'Karnik R', 'Meissner A', 'Carell T', 'Rathert P', 'Jurkowska RZ', 'Jeltsch A']"
30098026,Histone H3K36M mutation and trimethylation patterns in chondroblastoma.,"AIMS: Histones are essential components of chromatin, and mutations in histones lead to alterations in methylation and acetylation, which play an important role in tumorigenesis. Most of the chondroblastomas harbour the H3K36M mutation. With the availability of a mutation-specific antibody, we sought to assess the sensitivity of this antibody and the alterations of histone methylation in a series of chondroblastoma cases.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Immunohistochemical staining with antibodies against H3K36M, trimethylated histones (H3K27me3 and H3K36me3) and an osteoblastic marker (SATB2) was performed on 27 chondroblastomas from 27 patients. The clinical and radiological characteristics of each patient were reviewed. All 27 tumours showed typical radiological and histological features of chondroblastoma, with a subset of cases showing secondary aneurysmal bone cyst changes (11/27), giant-cell-rich foci (4/27), and matrix-rich areas mimicking chondromyxoid fibroma (1/27). All except one case (26/27, 96%) showed positive H3K36M immunostaining (nuclear). In the majority of cases, there was a diffuse staining pattern. Immunohistochemical staining for H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 showed a heterogeneous staining pattern in all cases, regardless of mutation status. None of the cases showed loss of positivity or diffuse positivity. Focal or diffuse SATB2 expression was seen in 21 of 26 tumours (81%).
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that the vast majority of chondroblastomas are positive for H3K36M by immunohistochemical analysis, confirming its diagnostic value. H3K27me3 expression and H3K36me3 expression are heterogeneous in these tumours.",Histopathology,2019,"['Lu C', 'Ramirez D', 'Hwang S', 'Jungbluth A', 'Frosina D', 'Ntiamoah P', 'Healey J', 'Zhu G', 'Chen W', 'Klein M', 'Hameed M']"
30096458,BMI1 and PTEN are key determinants of breast cancer therapy: A plausible therapeutic target in breast cancer.,"BMI-1 (B-lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1) is a key protein partner in polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) that helps in maintaining the integrity of the complex. It is also a key player in ubiquitination of histone H2A which affects gene expression pattern involved in various cellular processes such as cell proliferation, growth, DNA repair, apoptosis and senescence. In many cancers, Overexpression of BMI1correlates with advanced stages of disease, aggressive clinicopathological behavior, poor prognosis resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. BMI1 is emerging as a key player in EMT, chemo-resistance and cancer stemness. Overexpression is observed in various cancer types such as breast, primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), gastric, ovarian, head and neck, pancreatic and lung cancer. Studies have shown that experimental reduction of BMI protein level in tumor cells results in inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis and/or senescence, and increases susceptibility to cytotoxic agents and radiation therapy. Thus, inhibition of BMI1 expression particularly in breast cancer stem cells can be used as a potential strategy for the complete elimination of tumor and to prevent disease relapse. On other hand PTEN is known to be an important tumor suppressor next to p53. In many cancers particularly in breast cancer, p53 and PTEN undergo mutations. Studies have indicated the functional and mechanistic link between the BMI-1oncoprotein and tumor suppressor PTEN in the development and progression of cancer. The current review focuses on recent findings of how oncogenicity and chemo-resistance are caused by BMI1. It also highlights the transcriptional regulation between BMI1 and PTEN that dictates the therapeutic outcome in cancers where the functional p53 is absent. Herein, we have clearly demonstrated the regulation of transcription at genomic loci of BMI1 and PTEN in cancerous tissue or cells and the possible epigenetic regulation by histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) at BMI1 and PTEN loci that may provide some clue for the possible therapy against TNBC in near future.",Gene,2018,"['M JR', 'S V']"
30092612,Enhancer function regulated by combinations of transcription factors and cofactors.,"Regulation of the expression of diverse genes is essential for making possible the complexity of higher organisms, and the temporal and spatial regulation of gene expression allows for the alteration of cell types and growth patterns. A critical component of this regulation is the DNA sequence-specific binding of transcription factors (TFs). However, most TFs do not independently participate in gene transcriptional regulation, because they lack an effector function. Instead, TFs are thought to work by recruiting cofactors, including Mediator complex (Mediator), chromatin-remodeling complexes (CRCs), and histone-modifying complexes (HMCs). Mediator associates with the majority of transcribed genes and acts as an integrator of multiple signals. On the other hand, CRCs and HMCs are selectively recruited by TFs. Although all the pairings between TFs and CRCs or HMCs are not fully known, there are a growing number of established TF-CRC and TF-HMC combinations. In this review, we focused on the most important of these pairings and discuss how they control gene expression.",Genes Cells,2018,"['Nakagawa T', 'Yoneda M', 'Higashi M', 'Ohkuma Y', 'Ito T']"

30087349,Inhibition of a K9/K36 demethylase by an H3.3 point mutation found in paediatric glioblastoma.,"An array of oncogenic histone point mutations have been identified across a number of different cancer studies. It has been suggested that some of these mutant histones can exert their effects by inhibiting epigenetic writers. Here, we report that the H3.3 G34R (glycine to arginine) substitution mutation, found in paediatric gliomas, causes widespread changes in H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 by interfering with the KDM4 family of K9/K36 demethylases. Expression of a targeted single-copy of H3.3 G34R at endogenous levels induced chromatin alterations that were comparable to a KDM4 A/B/C triple-knockout. We find that H3.3 G34R preferentially binds KDM4 while simultaneously inhibiting its enzymatic activity, demonstrating that histone mutations can act through inhibition of epigenetic erasers. These results suggest that histone point mutations can exert their effects through interactions with a range of epigenetic readers, writers and erasers.",Nat Commun,2018,"['Voon HPJ', 'Udugama M', 'Lin W', 'Hii L', 'Law RHP', 'Steer DL', 'Das PP', 'Mann JR', 'Wong LH']"
30081950,"DNA methylation and repressive histones in the promoters of PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM-3, LAG-3, TIGIT, PD-L1, and galectin-9 genes in human colorectal cancer.","BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed human malignancy worldwide. Upregulation of inhibitory immune checkpoints by tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) or their ligands by tumor cells leads to tumor evasion from host immunosurveillance. Changes in DNA methylation pattern and enrichment of methylated histone marks in the promoter regions could be major contributors to the upregulation of immune checkpoints (ICs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME).
METHODS: Relative expressions of various immune checkpoints and ligands in colon normal tissues (NT) and colorectal tumor tissues (TT) were assessed by qRT-PCR. The epigenetic modifications behind this upregulation were determined by investigating the CpG methylation status of their promoter regions using bisulfite sequencing. Distributions of histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) in promoter regions of these genes were assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay.
RESULTS: We found that the expression levels of PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM-3, TIGIT, PD-L1, and galectin-9 were significantly higher in colorectal tumor tissues, compared with colon normal tissues. To study the role of DNA methylation, we checked the promoter CpG methylation of ICs and ligands and found that only CTLA-4 and TIGIT, among other genes, were significantly hypomethylated in TT compared with NT. Next, we checked the abundance of repressive histones (H3K9me3 and H3K27me3) in the promoter regions of ICs/ligands. We found that bindings of H3K9me3 in PD-1 and TIGIT promoters and H3K27me3 in CTLA-4 promotor were significantly lower in TT compared with NT. Additionally, bindings of both H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 in the TIM-3 promoter were significantly lower in TT compared with NT.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that both DNA hypomethylation and H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 repressive histones are involved in upregulation of CTLA-4 and TIGIT genes. However, repressive histones, but not DNA hypomethylation, are involved in upregulation of PD-1 and TIM-3 genes in CRC tumor tissue. These epigenetic modifications could be utilized as diagnostic biomarkers for CRC.",Clin Epigenetics,2018,"['Sasidharan Nair V', 'Toor SM', 'Taha RZ', 'Shaath H', 'Elkord E']"
30080437,JQ1 affects BRD2-dependent and independent transcription regulation without disrupting H4-hyperacetylated chromatin states.,"The bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) proteins are promising drug targets for cancer and immune diseases. However, BET inhibition effects have been studied more in the context of bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) than BRD2, and the BET protein association to histone H4-hyperacetylated chromatin is not understood at the genome-wide level. Here, we report transcription start site (TSS)-resolution integrative analyses of ChIP-seq and transcriptome profiles in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line H23. We show that di-acetylation at K5 and K8 of histone H4 (H4K5acK8ac) co-localizes with H3K27ac and BRD2 in the majority of active enhancers and promoters, where BRD2 has a stronger association with H4K5acK8ac than H3K27ac. Although BET inhibition by JQ1 led to complete reduction of BRD2 binding to chromatin, only local changes of H4K5acK8ac levels were observed, suggesting that recruitment of BRD2 does not influence global histone H4 hyperacetylation levels. This finding supports a model in which recruitment of BET proteins via histone H4 hyperacetylation is predominant over hyperacetylation of histone H4 by BET protein-associated acetyltransferases. In addition, we found that a remarkable number of BRD2-bound genes, including MYC and its downstream target genes, were transcriptionally upregulated upon JQ1 treatment. Using BRD2-enriched sites and transcriptional activity analysis, we identified candidate transcription factors potentially involved in the JQ1 response in BRD2-dependent and -independent manner.",Epigenetics,2018,"['Handoko L', 'Kaczkowski B', 'Hon CC', 'Lizio M', 'Wakamori M', 'Matsuda T', 'Ito T', 'Jeyamohan P', 'Sato Y', 'Sakamoto K', 'Yokoyama S', 'Kimura H', 'Minoda A', 'Umehara T']"
30076957,NASP antagonize chromatin accessibility through maintaining histone H3K9me1 in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"The regulation of histone deposits mediated by multi-chaperone complexes under physiological conditions remains to be further investigated. Here, we studied the function of nuclear autoantigenic sperm protein (NASP) in the regulation of liver cancer. We found that NASP levels in liver tumors were generally higher than in normal liver tissues and NASP down-regulation inhibited liver cancer cells from forming tumors. We further analyzed cellular responses and epigenetic mechanisms of the histone H3-H4 shortage induced by NASP knockdown in liver cancer cells. The results showed that the major effects of NASP knockdown were globally enhanced chromatin accessibility, which facilitates transcription release, and failure of replication initiation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that NASP depletion led to a global decrease of histone H3K9me1 modification associated with newly H3 processing, which occurred directly at the promoters of up-regulated anti-tumor genes BACH2 and RunX1T1. This also resulted in a synergistic effect on enhanced apoptosis with Myc and p53 decreases.

30076612,Inhibition of histone deacetylase 7 reverses concentrative nucleoside transporter 2 repression in colorectal cancer by up-regulating histone acetylation state.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The concentrative nucleoside transporter 2 (CNT2) mediates the uptake of both natural nucleosides and nucleoside-derived drugs. Therefore, it is important both physiologically and pharmacologically. However, CNT2 expression is significantly repressed in colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we have elucidated the mechanism(s) underlying CNT2 repression in CRC.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Repression of CNT2 in tumour samples from patients with CRC was identified using Western blot and RT-qPCR. The histone acetylation state at the CNT2 promoter region was then evaluated with chromatin immunoprecipitation and trichostatin A (TSA) treatment. To find the key enzyme responsible for hypoacetylation at the CNT2 promoter region, siRNA knockdown and RT-qPCR were used. Effects of combining HDAC inhibitors and cladribine were studied in HCT15 and HT29 cells.
KEY RESULTS: Histone deacetylase 7 was significantly up-regulated in CRC, leading to histone hypoacetylation at the CNT2 promoter region, especially at sites H3K9Ac, H3K18Ac and H4Ac. This hypoacetylation condensed the chromatin structure and reduced CNT2 expression. All these effects were reversed by treatment with TSA, a histone deacetylase inhibitor. In HCT15 and HT29 cells, inhibition of histone deacetylase increased cell uptake and decreased IC
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Histone hypoacetylation due to increased levels of histone deacetylase 7 results in CNT2 repression in CRC tumour tissue and could lead to decreased uptake of and consequent resistance to nucleoside anti-cancer agents. Such resistance could be overcome by combining inhibitors of histone deacetylase with the nucleoside anti-cancer agent.",Br. J.

30076409,RNAs interact with BRD4 to promote enhanced chromatin engagement and transcription activation.,"The bromodomain and extra-terminal motif (BET) protein BRD4 binds to acetylated histones at enhancers and promoters via its bromodomains (BDs) to regulate transcriptional elongation. In human colorectal cancer cells, we found that BRD4 was recruited to enhancers that were co-occupied by mutant p53 and supported the synthesis of enhancer-directed transcripts (eRNAs) in response to chronic immune signaling. BRD4 selectively associated with eRNAs that were produced from BRD4-bound enhancers. Using biochemical and biophysical methods, we found that BRD4 BDs function cooperatively as docking sites for eRNAs and that the BDs of BRD2, BRD3, BRDT, BRG1, and BRD7 directly interact with eRNAs. BRD4-eRNA interactions increased BRD4 binding to acetylated histones in vitro and augmented BRD4 enhancer recruitment and transcriptional cofactor activities. Our results suggest a mechanism by which eRNAs are directly involved in gene regulation by modulating enhancer interactions and transcriptional functions of BRD4.",Nat. Struct. Mol.

30075141,Metabolic Signaling to the Nucleus in Cancer.,"Nutrient-sensing mechanisms ensure that cellular activities are coordinated with nutrient availability. Recent work has established links between metabolite pools and protein post-translational modifications, as metabolites are substrates of enzymes that add or remove modifications such as acetylation, methylation, and glycosylation. Cancer cells undergo metabolic reprogramming and exhibit metabolic plasticity that allows them to survive and proliferate within the tumor microenvironment. In this article we review the evidence that, in cancer cells, nutrient availability and oncogenic metabolic reprogramming impact the abundance of key metabolites that regulate signaling and epigenetics. We propose models to explain how these metabolites may control locus-specific chromatin modification and gene expression. Finally, we discuss emerging roles of metabolites in regulating malignant phenotypes and tumorigenesis via transcriptional control.

Since oncohistone proteins co-exist with wild type histone proteins in cells, it is critically important to understand how they promote tumorigenesis. Here, we describe two methods to analyze the impact of these oncohistones on histone modification and epigenome, including the expression of oncohistone from a transgene and the utilization of CRISPR/Cas9 system to knock-in specific oncohistone mutations.

30073532,CRISPR/Cas9 Gene Editing of Human Histone H2A Variant H2AX and MacroH2A.,"Histone H2A variants play important roles in maintaining the integrity of the genome. For example, the histone variant H2AX is phosphorylated on Ser139 (called γH2AX) at DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) and serves as a signal for the initiation of downstream DNA damage response (DDR) factor recruitment and DNA repair activities within damaged chromatin. For decades, genetic studies in human cells involving DNA damage signaling and repair factors have relied mostly on either knockdown by RNA interference (i.e., shRNA and siRNA) or the use of mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from knockout (KO) mice. Recent advances in gene editing using ZNF nuclease, TALEN, and CRISPR/Cas9 have allowed the generation of human KO cell lines, allowing genetic models for studying the DDR, including histone H2A variants in human cells. Here, we describe a detailed protocol for generating and verifying KO of H2AX and macroH2A histone H2A variants using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in human cancer cell lines.

How the original epigenetic information conveyed by chromatin may be preserved in this context is a burning question. Elucidating the fate of parental histones, which characterize the pre-damage chromatin state, is a key step forward in deciphering the mechanisms that safeguard epigenome stability.

30071870,Tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndrome 1 protein functions as a scaffold required for ubiquitin-specific protease 4-directed histone deacetylase 2 de-ubiquitination and tumor growth.,"BACKGROUND: Although numerous studies have reported that tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndrome type I (TRPS1) protein, the only reported atypical GATA transcription factor, is overexpressed in various carcinomas, the underlying mechanism(s) by which it contributes to cancer remain unknown.
METHODS: Both overexpression and knockdown of TRPS1 assays were performed to examine the effect of TRPS1 on histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) protein level and luminal breast cancer cell proliferation. Also, RT-qRCR, luciferase reporter assay and RNA-sequencing were used for transcription detection. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using H4K16ac antibody in conjunction with qPCR was used for determining H4K16ac levels in targeted genes. Furthermore, in vitro cell proliferation assay and in vivo tumor xenografts were used to detect the effect of TRPS1 on tumor growth.
RESULTS: We found that TRPS1 scaffolding recruits and enhances interaction between USP4 and HDAC2 leading to HDAC2 de-ubiquitination and H4K16 deacetylation. We detected repression of a set of cellular growth-related genes by the TRPS1-USP4-HDAC2 axis indicating it is essential in tumor growth. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that silencing TRPS1 reduced tumor growth, whereas overexpression of HDAC2 restored tumor growth.
CONCLUSION: Our study deciphered the TRPS1-USP4-HDAC2 axis as a novel mechanism that contributes to tumor growth. Significantly, our results revealed the scaffolding function of TPRS1 in USP4-directed HDAC2 de-ubiquitination and provided new mechanistic insights into the crosstalk between TRPS1, ubiquitin, and histone modification systems leading to tumor growth.",Breast Cancer Res.,2018,"['Wang Y', 'Zhang J', 'Wu L', 'Liu W', 'Wei G', 'Gong X', 'Liu Y', 'Ma Z', 'Ma F', 'Thiery JP', 'Chen L']"

30060749,DNA Topoisomerase I differentially modulates R-loops across the human genome.,"BACKGROUND: Co-transcriptional R-loops are abundant non-B DNA structures in mammalian genomes. DNA Topoisomerase I (Top1) is often thought to regulate R-loop formation owing to its ability to resolve both positive and negative supercoils. How Top1 regulates R-loop structures at a global level is unknown.
RESULTS: Here, we perform high-resolution strand-specific R-loop mapping in human cells depleted for Top1 and find that Top1 depletion results in both R-loop gains and losses at thousands of transcribed loci, delineating two distinct gene classes. R-loop gains are characteristic for long, highly transcribed, genes located in gene-poor regions anchored to Lamin B1 domains and in proximity to H3K9me3-marked heterochromatic patches. R-loop losses, by contrast, occur in gene-rich regions overlapping H3K27me3-marked active replication initiation regions. Interestingly, Top1 depletion coincides with a block of the cell cycle in G0/G1 phase and a trend towards replication delay.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal new properties of Top1 in regulating R-loop homeostasis in a context-dependent manner and suggest a potential role for Top1 in modulating the replication process via R-loop formation.",Genome Biol.,2018,"['Manzo SG', 'Hartono SR', 'Sanz LA', 'Marinello J', 'De Biasi S', 'Cossarizza A', 'Capranico G', 'Chedin F']"
30060743,Chromatin loop anchors are associated with genome instability in cancer and recombination hotspots in the germline.,"BACKGROUND: Chromatin loops form a basic unit of interphase nuclear organization, with chromatin loop anchor points providing contacts between regulatory regions and promoters. However, the mutational landscape at these anchor points remains under-studied. Here, we describe the unusual patterns of somatic mutations and germline variation associated with loop anchor points and explore the underlying features influencing these patterns.
RESULTS: Analyses of whole genome sequencing datasets reveal that anchor points are strongly depleted for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in tumours. Despite low SNV rates in their genomic neighbourhood, anchor points emerge as sites of evolutionary innovation, showing enrichment for structural variant (SV) breakpoints and a peak of SNVs at focal CTCF sites within the anchor points. Both CTCF-bound and non-CTCF anchor points harbour an excess of SV breakpoints in multiple tumour types and are prone to double-strand breaks in cell lines. Common fragile sites, which are hotspots for genome instability, also show elevated numbers of intersecting loop anchor points. Recurrently disrupted anchor points are enriched for genes with functions in cell cycle transitions and regions associated with predisposition to cancer. We also discover a novel class of CTCF-bound anchor points which overlap meiotic recombination hotspots and are enriched for the core PRDM9 binding motif, suggesting that the anchor points have been foci for diversity generated during recent human evolution.
CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the unusual chromatin environment at loop anchor points underlies the elevated rates of variation observed, marking them as sites of regulatory importance but also genomic fragility.",Genome Biol.,2018,"['Kaiser VB', 'Semple CA']"
30060056,"Histone demethylase KDM2B promotes triple negative breast cancer proliferation by suppressing p15INK4B, p16INK4A, and p57KIP2 transcription.","H3K4me3 and H3K36me2 histone demethylase KDM2B is an epigenetic regulatory factor involved in cell proliferation in numerous cells including breast cancer cells, however, the regulatory mechanism of KDM2B in cell proliferation of breast cancer cells, specifically in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), remains largely unknown. In this study, we showed that higher expression level of KDM2B was associated with poor prognosis in TNBC. Using cell proliferation assay, we found that KDM2B promoted TNBC cell proliferation by suppressing the transcription of the cell cycle inhibitors p15INK4B, p16INK4A, and p57KIP2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay results showed that KDM2B bound to the promoters of these genes and thereby reduced the H3K4me3 and H3K36me2 levels, leading to the suppression of gene transcription in a histone demethylation activity-dependent manner. Silencing of p15INK4B, p16INK4A, and p57KIP2 in TNBC cells was shown to restore the promoting effect of KDM2B on TNBC cell proliferation. The present study reveals a novel cell regulatory mechanism through which KDM2B promotes TNBC cell proliferation by binding to the promoters of p15INK4B, p16INK4A, and p57KIP2, which reduces H3K4me3 and H3K36me2 levels to suppress gene transcription.",Acta Biochim.

30057114,Cross-talk between Lysine-Modifying Enzymes Controls Site-Specific DNA Amplifications.,"Acquired chromosomal DNA amplifications are features of many tumors. Although overexpression and stabilization of the histone H3 lysine 9/36 (H3K9/36) tri-demethylase KDM4A generates transient site-specific copy number gains (TSSGs), additional mechanisms directly controlling site-specific DNA copy gains are not well defined. In this study, we uncover a collection of H3K4-modifying chromatin regulators that function with H3K9 and H3K36 regulators to orchestrate TSSGs. Specifically, the H3K4 tri-demethylase KDM5A and specific COMPASS/KMT2 H3K4 methyltransferases modulate different TSSG loci through H3K4 methylation states and KDM4A recruitment. Furthermore, a distinct chromatin modifier network, MLL1-KDM4B-KDM5B, controls copy number regulation at a specific genomic locus in a KDM4A-independent manner. These pathways comprise an epigenetic addressing system for defining site-specific DNA rereplication and amplifications.",Cell,2018,"['Mishra S', 'Van Rechem C', 'Pal S', 'Clarke TL', 'Chakraborty D', 'Mahan SD', 'Black JC', 'Murphy SE', 'Lawrence MS', 'Daniels DL', 'Whetstine JR']"
30056065,The effects of single-dose injections of modafinil and methamphetamine on epigenetic and functional markers in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex: potential role of dopamine receptors.,"METH use causes neuroadaptations that negatively impact the prefrontal cortex (PFC) leading to addiction and associated cognitive decline in animals and humans. In contrast, modafinil enhances cognition by increasing PFC function. Accumulated evidence indicates that psychostimulant drugs, including modafinil and METH, regulate gene expression via epigenetic modifications. In this study, we measured the effects of single-dose injections of modafinil and METH on the protein levels of acetylated histone H3 (H3ac) and H4ac, deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2, and of the NMDA subunit GluN1 in the medial PFC (mPFC) of mice euthanized 1 h after drug administration. To test if dopamine (DA) receptors (DRs) participate in the biochemical effects of the two drugs, we injected the D1Rs antagonist, SCH23390, or the D2Rs antagonist, raclopride, 30 min before administration of METH and modafinil. We evaluated each drug effect on glutamate synaptic transmission in D1R-expressing layer V pyramidal neurons. We also measured the enrichment of H3ac and H4ac at the promoters of several genes including DA, NE, orexin, histamine, and glutamate receptors, and their mRNA expression, since they are responsive to chronic modafinil and METH treatment. Acute modafinil and METH injections caused similar effects on total histone acetylation, increasing H3ac and decreasing H4ac, and they also increased HDAC1, HDAC2 and GluN1 protein levels in the mouse mPFC. In addition, the effects of the drugs were prevented by pre-treatment with D1Rs and D2Rs antagonists. Specifically, the changes in H4ac, HDAC2, and GluN1 were responsive to SCH23390, whereas those of H3ac and GluN1 were responsive to raclopride. Whole-cell patch clamp in transgenic BAC-Drd1a-tdTomato mice showed that METH, but not modafinil, induced paired-pulse facilitation of EPSCs, suggesting reduced presynaptic probability of glutamate release onto layer V pyramidal neurons. Analysis of histone 3/4 enrichment at specific promoters revealed: i) distinct effects of the drugs on histone 3 acetylation, with modafinil increasing H3ac at Drd1 and Adra1b promoters, but METH increasing H3ac at Adra1a; ii) distinct effects on histone 4 acetylation enrichment, with modafinil increasing H4ac at the Drd2 promoter and decreasing it at Hrh1, but METH increasing H4ac at Drd1; iii) comparable effects of both psychostimulants, increasing H3ac at Drd2, Hcrtr1, and Hrh1 promoters, decreasing H3ac at Hrh3, increasing H4ac at Hcrtr1, and decreasing H4ac at Hcrtr2, Hrh3, and Grin1 promoters. Interestingly, only METH altered mRNA levels of genes with altered histone acetylation status, inducing increased expression of Drd1a, Adra1a, Hcrtr1, and Hrh1, and decreasing Grin1. Our study suggests that although acute METH and modafinil can both increase DA neurotransmission in the mPFC, there are similar and contrasting epigenetic and transcriptional consequences that may account for their divergent clinical effects.",Prog.

30055111,The chromatin remodeling protein INO80 contributes to the removal of H2A.Z at the p53-binding site of the p21 gene in response to doxorubicin.,"Transcriptional activation of p21 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A) due to DNA damage often alters the distribution of histone variant H2A.Z at the p21 gene. However, whether the human INO80 complex regulates changes in H2A.Z at the p21 promoter is unclear. We show here that activation of p21 expression by doxorubicin (Doxo) in U2OS cells is required for removal of H2A.Z by INO80 at the p53-binding site proximal region (-2.2 kb) of the p21 promoter. A purified INO80 complex, but not the INO80E653Q mutant-complex, which lost DNA-sliding activity, is mainly responsible for removing H2A.Z from reconstituted nucleosomes in vitro. This activity was enhanced with MOF-mediated histone acetylation, suggesting that INO80 more readily removes H2A.Z from loosened nucleosomes. Also, co-occupancy of INO80 and H2A.Z -2.2 kb upstream of the p21 transcriptional start site (TSS) was observed. H2A.Z at this region was removed in a short time after Doxo treatment and activated p21 expression. However, p21 induction was inhibited by INO80 knockdown by delaying H2A.Z removal, indicating the need for INO80. Moreover, shMOF-mediated histone acetylation reduced recruitment of INO80 -2.2 kb upstream of p21 TSS and inhibited the removal of H2A.Z in Doxo-treated cells. These data provide new insights into the transcriptional regulation of p21 by the INO80 complex.",FEBS J.,2018,"['Ding J', 'Yu C', 'Sui Y', 'Wang L', 'Yang Y', 'Wang F', 'Yao H', 'Xing F', 'Liu H', 'Li Y', 'Shah JA', 'Cai Y', 'Jin J']"
30051352,TSPYL2 Regulates the Expression of EZH2 Target Genes in Neurons.,"Testis-specific protein, Y-encoded-like 2 (TSPYL2) is an X-linked gene in the locus for several neurodevelopmental disorders. We have previously shown that Tspyl2 knockout mice had impaired learning and sensorimotor gating, and TSPYL2 facilitates the expression of Grin2a and Grin2b through interaction with CREB-binding protein. To identify other genes regulated by TSPYL2, here, we showed that Tspyl2 knockout mice had an increased level of H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) in the hippocampus, and TSPYL2 interacted with the H3K27 methyltransferase enhancer of zeste 2 (EZH2). We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing in primary hippocampal neurons and divided all Refseq genes by k-mean clustering into four clusters from highest level of H3K27me3 to unmarked. We confirmed that mutant neurons had an increased level of H3K27me3 in cluster 1 genes, which consist of known EZH2 target genes important in development. We detected significantly reduced expression of genes including Gbx2 and Prss16 from cluster 1 and Acvrl1, Bdnf, Egr3, Grin2c, and Igf1 from cluster 2 in the mutant. In support of a dynamic role of EZH2 in repressing marked synaptic genes, the specific EZH2 inhibitor GSK126 significantly upregulated, while the demethylase inhibitor GSKJ4 downregulated the expression of Egr3 and Grin2c. GSK126 also upregulated the expression of Bdnf in mutant primary neurons. Finally, ChIP showed that hemagglutinin-tagged TSPYL2 co-existed with EZH2 in target promoters in neuroblastoma cells. Taken together, our data suggest that TSPYL2 is recruited to promoters of specific EZH2 target genes in neurons, and enhances their expression for proper neuronal maturation and function.",Mol.

30044984,Super-Resolution Imaging of Higher-Order Chromatin Structures at Different Epigenomic States in Single Mammalian Cells.,"Histone modifications influence higher-order chromatin structures at individual epigenomic states and chromatin environments to regulate gene expression. However, genome-wide higher-order chromatin structures shaped by different histone modifications remain poorly characterized. With stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), we characterized the higher-order chromatin structures at their epigenomic states, categorized into three major types in interphase: histone acetylation marks form spatially segregated nanoclusters, active histone methylation marks form spatially dispersed larger nanodomains, and repressive histone methylation marks form condensed large aggregates. These distinct structural characteristics are also observed in mitotic chromosomes. Furthermore, active histone marks coincide with less compact chromatin and exhibit a higher degree of co-localization with other active marks and RNA polymerase II (RNAP II), while repressive marks coincide with densely packed chromatin and spatially distant from repressive marks and active RNAP II. Taken together, super-resolution imaging reveals three distinct chromatin structures at various epigenomic states, which may be spatially coordinated to impact transcription.",Cell Rep,2018,"['Xu J', 'Ma H', 'Jin J', 'Uttam S', 'Fu R', 'Huang Y', 'Liu Y']"

30030619,Carnosine influences transcription via epigenetic regulation as demonstrated by enhanced histone acetylation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 promoter in glioblastoma cells.,"Carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine) affects a plethora of signaling pathways and genes in different biological systems. Although known as a radical scavenger, not all of these effects can simply be ascribed to its chemical nature. As previous experiments pointed towards the possibility that carnosine affects epigenetic regulation via histone acetylation, we investigated this hypothesis using the glioblastoma cell lines U87 and T98G in which carnosine's anti-neoplastic effect is accompanied by increased expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4. Viability and expression of PDK4 was analyzed after incubation in carnosine and different histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) using cell-based assays and qRT-PCR. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments were performed and the global influence of carnosine on histone H3 acetylation was analyzed by Western blot. Carnosine as well as the HDACi used increased expression of PDK4. In addition, all compounds reduced cell viability, although differences were observed with regard to magnitude and required concentrations. ChIP analysis revealed increased acetylation of histone H3 in the PDK4 promoter of U87 and T98G cells (~ 1.3- and ~ 1.7-fold, respectively) 6 h after the addition of carnosine (50 mM) followed by increased expression of PDK4 mRNA. Western blots did not detect a general increase of H3 acetylation at a genome-wide scale under the influence of carnosine.

30029006,Functions of FACT in Breaking the Nucleosome and Maintaining Its Integrity at the Single-Nucleosome Level.,"The human FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) complex, composed of two subunits SPT16 (Suppressor of Ty 16) and SSRP1 (Structure-specific recognition protein-1), plays essential roles in nucleosome remodeling. However, the molecular mechanism of FACT reorganizing the nucleosome still remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that FACT displays dual functions in destabilizing the nucleosome and maintaining the original histones and nucleosome integrity at the single-nucleosome level. We found that the subunit SSRP1 is responsible for maintenance of nucleosome integrity by holding the H3/H4 tetramer on DNA and promoting the deposition of the H2A/H2B dimer onto the nucleosome. In contrast, the large subunit SPT16 destabilizes the nucleosome structure by displacing the H2A/H2B dimers. Our findings provide mechanistic insights by which the two subunits of FACT coordinate with each other to fulfill its functions and suggest that FACT may play essential roles in preserving the original histones with epigenetic identity during transcription or DNA replication.",Mol.

Overall, we identified ∼8,700 crosslinks, of which 2/3 represent links connecting distinct proteins. From these data, we gain insights on interactions involving histone proteins. We observed that core histones on the nucleosomes expose well-defined interaction hot spots. For several nucleosome-interacting proteins, such as USF3 and Ran GTPase, the data allowed us to build low-resolution models of their binding mode to the nucleosome. For HMGN2, the data guided the construction of a refined model of the interaction with the nucleosome, based on complementary NMR, XL-MS, and modeling. Excitingly, the analysis of crosslinks carrying posttranslational modifications allowed us to extract how specific modifications influence nucleosome interactions.

30017582,Systematic Study of Nucleosome-Displacing Factors in Budding Yeast.,"Nucleosomes present a barrier for the binding of most transcription factors (TFs). However, special TFs known as nucleosome-displacing factors (NDFs) can access embedded sites and cause the depletion of the local nucleosomes as well as repositioning of the neighboring nucleosomes. Here, we developed a novel high-throughput method in yeast to identify NDFs among 104 TFs and systematically characterized the impact of orientation, affinity, location, and copy number of their binding motifs on the nucleosome occupancy. Using this assay, we identified 29 NDF motifs and divided the nuclear TFs into three groups with strong, weak, and no nucleosome-displacing activities. Further studies revealed that tight DNA binding is the key property that underlies NDF activity, and the NDFs may partially rely on the DNA replication to compete with nucleosome. Overall, our study presents a framework to functionally characterize NDFs and elucidate the mechanism of nucleosome invasion.",Mol. Cell,2018,"['Yan C', 'Chen H', 'Bai L']"
30014449,RNA Sequencing and Pathway Analysis Identify Important Pathways Involved in Hypertrichosis and Intellectual Disability in Patients with Wiedemann-Steiner Syndrome.,"A growing number of histone modifiers are involved in human neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting that proper regulation of chromatin state is essential for the development of the central nervous system. Among them, heterozygous de novo variants in KMT2A, a gene coding for histone methyltransferase, have been associated with Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WSS), a rare developmental disorder mainly characterized by intellectual disability (ID) and hypertrichosis. As KMT2A is known to regulate the expression of multiple target genes through methylation of lysine 4 of histone 3 (H3K4me), we sought to investigate the transcriptomic consequences of KMT2A variants involved in WSS. Using fibroblasts from four WSS patients harboring loss-of-function KMT2A variants, we performed RNA sequencing and identified a number of genes for which transcription was altered in KMT2A-mutated cells compared to the control ones. Strikingly, analysis of the pathways and biological functions significantly deregulated between patients with WSS and healthy individuals revealed a number of processes predicted to be altered that are relevant for hypertrichosis and intellectual disability, the cardinal signs of this disease.",Neuromolecular Med.,2018,"['Mietton L', 'Lebrun N', 'Giurgea I', 'Goldenberg A', 'Saintpierre B', 'Hamroune J', 'Afenjar A', 'Billuart P', 'Bienvenu T']"

30010961,H3K4me2 and WDR5 enriched chromatin interacting long non-coding RNAs maintain transcriptionally competent chromatin at divergent transcriptional units.,"Recently lncRNAs have been implicated in the sub-compartmentalization of eukaryotic genome via genomic targeting of chromatin remodelers. To explore the function of lncRNAs in the maintenance of active chromatin, we characterized lncRNAs from the chromatin enriched with H3K4me2 and WDR5 using chromatin RNA immunoprecipitation (ChRIP). Significant portion of these enriched lncRNAs were arranged in antisense orientation with respect to their protein coding partners. Among these, 209 lncRNAs, commonly enriched in H3K4me2 and WDR5 chromatin fractions, were named as active chromatin associated lncRNAs (active lncCARs). Interestingly, 43% of these active lncCARs map to divergent transcription units. Divergent transcription (XH) units were overrepresented in the active lncCARs as compared to the inactive lncCARs. ChIP-seq analysis revealed that active XH transcription units are enriched with H3K4me2, H3K4me3 and WDR5. WDR5 depletion resulted in the loss of H3K4me3 but not H3K4me2 at the XH promoters. Active XH CARs interact with and recruit WDR5 to XH promoters, and their depletion leads to decrease in the expression of the corresponding protein coding genes and loss of H3K4me2, H3K4me3 and WDR5 at the active XH promoters.

BAF180 is the chromatin-targeting subunit of the PBAF complex. BAF180 has six bromodomains, two BAH domains, and one HMG box. Bromodomains are known to recognize acetylated-lysines on histones and play a role in nucleosome recognition. BAH domains are required for ubiquitination of PCNA, a key regulator of DNA damage. The putative HMG box, if functional, may be involved in DNA-binding. While the binding specificities of individual bromodomains have been studied by our lab and others, the results have failed to reach a consensus. The acetyl-histone binding features of the full-length protein is unknown and is the motivation for this work. The hypothetical HMG and BAH domains have not been studied and the actual function of these regions is currently unknown. Thus, the precise interactions of this large and complex protein are not well-studied. Advances in understanding this large protein have been hindered by the inability to express and purify recombinant full-length BAF180 protein. Currently, only phenomenological studies using BAF180 expressed in mammalian cells have been conducted. Here, we report the successful expression, purification of full-length biologically active BAF180 protein using the GAP promoter in the heterologous host Pichia pastoris. The ability to express full-length and mutated BAF180 will allow for biophysical binding studies.

30009770,Modifying Chromatin by Histone Tail Clipping.,"Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histone proteins play a crucial role in the regulation of chromatin structure and functions. Studies in the last few decades have revealed the significance of histone PTMs in key cellular processes including DNA replication, repair, transcription, apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. The PTMs on histones are carried out by chromatin modifiers, which are reversible in nature. The dynamic activity of chromatin modifiers maintains the levels of different PTMs on histones. The modified histones are recognized by reader proteins, which recruit effector proteins to regulate the function. The interplay between histone PTMs and chromatin dynamics plays a major role in the regulation of most of the cellular processes. Importantly, the perturbations in the histone PTMs by various intrinsic or extrinsic factors can cause defects in fundamental cellular processes leading to a wide range of diseases. The proteolytic clipping of histone proteins has also been shown to regulate many biological processes. Histone clipping has been observed from yeast to mammals, suggesting that this mechanism is a conserved epigenetic phenomenon. In this review, we have summarized the significance of histone clipping and provided future directions to comprehend the mechanism of this distinct and poorly understood epigenetic event.",J. Mol.

30007360,The interplay between H2A.Z and H3K9 methylation in regulating HP1α binding to linker histone-containing chromatin.,"One of the most intensively studied chromatin binding factors is HP1α. HP1α is associated with silenced, heterochromatic regions of the genome and binds to H3K9me3. While H3K9me3 is necessary for HP1α recruitment to heterochromatin, it is becoming apparent that it is not sufficient suggesting that additional factors are involved. One candidate proposed as a potential regulator of HP1α recruitment is the linker histone H1.4. Changes to the underlying make-up of chromatin, such as the incorporation of the histone variant H2A.Z, has also been linked with regulating HP1 binding to chromatin. Here, we rigorously dissected the effects of H1.4, H2A.Z and H3K9me3 on the nucleosome binding activity of HP1α in vitro employing arrays, mononucleosomes and nucleosome core particles. Unexpectedly, histone H1.4 impedes the binding of HP1α but strikingly, this inhibition is partially relieved by the incorporation of both H2A.Z and H3K9me3 but only in the context of arrays or nucleosome core particles. Our data suggests that there are two modes of interaction of HP1α with nucleosomes. The first primary mode is through interactions with linker DNA. However, when linker DNA is missing or occluded by linker histones, HP1α directly interacts with the nucleosome core and this interaction is enhanced by H2A.Z with H3K9me3.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2018,"['Ryan DP', 'Tremethick DJ']"
30006506,SUMO2 conjugation of PCNA facilitates chromatin remodeling to resolve transcription-replication conflicts.,"During DNA synthesis, DNA replication and transcription machinery can collide, and the replication fork may temporarily dislodge RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) to resolve the transcription-replication conflict (TRC), a major source of endogenous DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and common fragile site (CFS) instability. However, the mechanism of TRC resolution remains unclear. Here, we show that conjugation of SUMO2, but not SUMO1 or SUMO3, to the essential replication factor PCNA is induced on transcribed chromatin by the RNAPII-bound helicase RECQ5. Proteomic analysis reveals that SUMO2-PCNA enriches histone chaperones CAF1 and FACT in the replication complex via interactions with their SUMO-interacting motifs. SUMO2-PCNA enhances CAF1-dependent histone deposition, which correlates with increased histone H3.1 at CFSs and repressive histone marks in the chromatin to reduce chromatin accessibility. Hence, SUMO2-PCNA dislodges RNAPII at CFSs, and overexpressing either SUMO2-PCNA or CAF1 reduces the incidence of DSBs in TRC-prone RECQ5-deficient cells.",Nat Commun,2018,"['Li M', 'Xu X', 'Chang CW', 'Zheng L', 'Shen B', 'Liu Y']"

30001904,Sink into the Epigenome: Histones as Repositories That Influence Cellular Metabolism.,"Epigenetic modifications on chromatin are most commonly thought to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Due to their dependency on small-molecule metabolites, these modifications can relay information about cellular metabolic state to the genome for the activation or repression of particular sets of genes. In this review we discuss emerging evidence that these modifications might also have a metabolic purpose. Due to their abundance, the histones have the capacity to store substantial amounts of useful metabolites or to enable important metabolic transformations. Such metabolic functions for histones could help to explain the widespread occurrence of particular modifications that may not always be strongly correlated with transcriptional activity.",Trends Endocrinol.

29992318,Loss of tumor suppressor IGFBP4 drives epigenetic reprogramming in hepatic carcinogenesis.,"Genomic sequencing of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) uncovers a paucity of actionable mutations, underscoring the necessity to exploit epigenetic vulnerabilities for therapeutics. In HCC, EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 represents a major oncogenic chromatin modification, but how it modulates the therapeutic vulnerability of signaling pathways remains unknown. Here, we show EZH2 acts antagonistically to AKT signaling in maintaining H3K27 methylome through epigenetic silencing of IGFBP4. ChIP-seq revealed enrichment of Ezh2/H3K27me3 at silenced loci in HBx-transgenic mouse-derived HCCs, including Igfbp4 whose down-regulation significantly correlated with EZH2 overexpression and poor survivals of HCC patients. Functional characterizations demonstrated potent growth- and invasion-suppressive functions of IGFBP4, which was associated with transcriptomic alterations leading to deregulation of multiple signaling pathways. Mechanistically, IGFBP4 stimulated AKT/EZH2 phosphorylation to abrogate H3K27me3-mediated silencing, forming a reciprocal feedback loop that suppressed core transcription factor networks (FOXA1/HNF1A/HNF4A/KLF9/NR1H4) for normal liver homeostasis.

29987187,"Histone Citrullination Represses MicroRNA Expression, Resulting in Increased Oncogene mRNAs in Somatolactotrope Cells.","Peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) enzymes convert histone arginine residues into citrulline to modulate chromatin organization and gene expression. Although PADs are expressed in anterior pituitary gland cells, their functional role and expression in pituitary adenomas are unknown. To begin to address these issues, we first examined normal human pituitaries and pituitary adenomas and found that PAD2, PAD4, and citrullinated histones are highest in prolactinomas and somatoprolactinomas. In the somatoprolactinoma-derived GH3 cell line, PADs citrullinate histone H3, which is attenuated by a pan-PAD inhibitor. RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies show that the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) let-7c-2, 23b, and 29c is suppressed by histone citrullination. Our studies demonstrate that these miRNAs directly target the mRNA of the oncogenes encoding HMGA, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and N-MYC, which are highly implicated in human prolactinoma/somatoprolactinoma pathogenesis. Our results are the first to define a direct role for PAD-catalyzed histone citrullination in miRNA expression, which may underlie the etiology of prolactinoma and somatoprolactinoma tumors through regulation of oncogene expression.",Mol.

29986055,Histone variant H2A.Z deposition and acetylation directs the canonical Notch signaling response.,"A fundamental as yet incompletely understood feature of Notch signal transduction is a transcriptional shift from repression to activation that depends on chromatin regulation mediated by transcription factor RBP-J and associated cofactors. Incorporation of histone variants alter the functional properties of chromatin and are implicated in the regulation of gene expression. Here, we show that depletion of histone variant H2A.Z leads to upregulation of canonical Notch target genes and that the H2A.Z-chaperone TRRAP/p400/Tip60 complex physically associates with RBP-J at Notch-dependent enhancers. When targeted to RBP-J-bound enhancers, the acetyltransferase Tip60 acetylates H2A.Z and upregulates Notch target gene expression. Importantly, the Drosophila homologs of Tip60, p400 and H2A.Z modulate Notch signaling response and growth in vivo. Together, our data reveal that loading and acetylation of H2A.Z are required to assure tight control of canonical Notch activation.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2018,"['Giaimo BD', 'Ferrante F', 'Vallejo DM', 'Hein K', 'Gutierrez-Perez I', 'Nist A', 'Stiewe T', 'Mittler G', 'Herold S', 'Zimmermann T', 'Bartkuhn M', 'Schwarz P', 'Oswald F', 'Dominguez M', 'Borggrefe T']"
29983832,H3K27 acetylation and gene expression analysis reveals differences in placental chromatin activity in fetal growth restriction.,"Background: Posttranslational modification of histone tails such as histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) is tightly coupled to epigenetic regulation of gene expression. To explore whether this is involved in placenta pathology, we probed genome-wide H3K27ac occupancy by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) in healthy placentas and placentas from pathological pregnancies with fetal growth restriction (FGR). Furthermore, we related specific acetylation profiles of FGR placentas to gene expression changes.
Results: Analysis of H3K27ac occupancy in FGR compared to healthy placentas showed 970 differentially acetylated regions distributed throughout the genome. Principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering revealed complete segregation of the FGR and control group. Next, we identified 569 upregulated genes and 521 downregulated genes in FGR placentas by RNA sequencing. Differential gene transcription largely corresponded to expected direction based on H3K27ac status. Pathway analysis on upregulated transcripts originating from hyperacetylated sites revealed genes related to the HIF-1-alpha transcription factor network and several other genes with known involvement in placental pathology (LEP, FLT1, HK2, ENG, FOS). Downregulated transcripts in the vicinity of hypoacetylated sites were related to the immune system and growth hormone receptor signaling. Additionally, we found enrichment of 141 transcription factor binding motifs within differentially acetylated regions. Of the corresponding transcription factors, four were upregulated, SP1, ARNT2, HEY2, and VDR, and two downregulated, FOSL and NR4A1.
Conclusion: We demonstrate a key role for genome-wide alterations in H3K27ac in FGR placentas corresponding with changes in transcription profiles of regions relevant to placental function.

Major epigenetic modifications in both DNA and histone could be involved in upregulation of immune checkpoints in cancer.
Methods: Expressions of different immune checkpoint genes and PD-L1 were assessed using qRT-PCR, and the underlying epigenetic modifications including CpG methylation and repressive histone abundance were determined using bisulfite sequencing, and histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP), respectively.
Results: We first assessed the expression level of six immune checkpoints/ligands and found that PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM-3, and LAG-3 were significantly upregulated in breast tumor tissues (TT), compared with breast normal tissues (NT). We investigated the epigenetic modifications beyond this upregulation in immune checkpoint genes. Interestingly, we found that CpG islands in the promoter regions of PD-1, CTLA-4, and TIM-3 were significantly hypomethylated in tumor compared with normal tissues. Additionally, CpG islands of PD-L1 promoter were completely demethylated (100%), LAG-3 were highly hypomethylated (80-90%), and TIGIT were poorly hypomethylated (20-30%), in both NT and TT. These demethylation findings are in accordance with the relative expression data that, out of all these genes, PD-L1 was highly expressed and completely demethylated and TIGIT was poorly expressed and hypermethylated in both NT and TT. Moreover, bindings of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 were found to be reduced in the promoter loci of PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM-3, and LAG-3 in tumor tissues.
Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that both DNA and histone modifications are involved in upregulation of PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM-3, and LAG-3 in breast tumor tissue and these epigenetic modifications could be useful as diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets in breast cancer.",Clin Epigenetics,2018,"['Sasidharan Nair V', 'El Salhat H', 'Taha RZ', 'John A', 'Ali BR', 'Elkord E']"
29982688,Histone H1 acetylation at lysine 85 regulates chromatin condensation and genome stability upon DNA damage.,"Linker histone H1 has a key role in maintaining higher order chromatin structure and genome stability, but how H1 functions in these processes is elusive. Here, we report that acetylation of lysine 85 (K85) within the H1 globular domain is a critical post-translational modification that regulates chromatin organization. H1K85 is dynamically acetylated by the acetyltransferase PCAF in response to DNA damage, and this effect is counterbalanced by the histone deacetylase HDAC1. Notably, an acetylation-mimic mutation of H1K85 (H1K85Q) alters H1 binding to the nucleosome and leads to condensed chromatin as a result of increased H1 binding to core histones. In addition, H1K85 acetylation promotes heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) recruitment to facilitate chromatin compaction. Consequently, H1K85 mutation leads to genomic instability and decreased cell survival upon DNA damage. Together, our data suggest a novel model whereby H1K85 acetylation regulates chromatin structure and preserves chromosome integrity upon DNA damage.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2018,"['Li Y', 'Li Z', 'Dong L', 'Tang M', 'Zhang P', 'Zhang C', 'Cao Z', 'Zhu Q', 'Chen Y', 'Wang H', 'Wang T', 'Lv D', 'Wang L', 'Zhao Y', 'Yang Y', 'Wang H', 'Zhang H', 'Roeder RG', 'Zhu WG']"

We used affinity-purified insect cell-produced enzymes and synthetic peptides with trimethylated lysines as substrates for the in vitro enzyme activity assays. In addition, we treated breast cancer cell lines with cell-permeable forms of 2-OG analogues and studied their effects on the global histone methylation state.

29974127,Crosstalk between metabolism and epigenetic modifications in autoimmune diseases: a comprehensive overview.,"Little information is available regarding mechanistic links between epigenetic modifications and autoimmune diseases. It seems plausible to surmise that aberrant gene expression and energy metabolism would disrupt immune tolerance, which could ultimately result in autoimmune responses. Metaboloepigenetics is an emerging paradigm that defines the interrelationships between metabolism and epigenetics. Epigenetic modifications, such as the methylation/demethylation of DNA and histone proteins and histone acetylation/deacetylation can be dynamically produced and eliminated by a group of enzymes that consume several metabolites derived from various physiological pathways. Recent insights into cellular metabolism have demonstrated that environmental stimuli such as dietary exposure and nutritional status act through the variation in concentration of metabolites to affect epigenetic regulation and breakdown biochemical homeostasis. Metabolites, including S-adenosylmethionine, acetyl-CoA, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, α-ketoglutarate, and ATP serve as cofactors for chromatin-modifying enzymes, such as methyltransferases, deacetylases and kinases, which are responsible for chromatin remodelling. The concentration of crucial nutrients, such as glucose, glutamine, and oxygen, spatially and temporally modulate epigenetic modifications to regulate gene expression and the reaction to stressful microenvironments in disease pathology. In this review, we focus on the interaction between metabolic intermediates and epigenetic modifications, integrating environmental signals with programmes through modification of the epigenome-metabolome to speculate as to how this may influence autoimmune diseases.",Cell.

Soluble factors secreted by breast cancer cells trigger a cascade of events that stimulate osteoclast differentiation in the bone microenvironment. MacroH2A is a unique histone variant with a C-terminal non-histone domain and plays a crucial role in modulating chromatin organization and gene transcription. Here, we show that macroH2A1.2, one of the macroH2A isoforms, has an intrinsic ability to inhibit breast cancer-derived osteoclastogenesis. This repressive effect requires macroH2A1.2-dependent attenuation of expression and secretion of lysyl oxidase (LOX) in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, our mechanistic studies reveal that macroH2A1.2 physically and functionally interacts with the histone methyltransferase EZH2 and elevates H3K27me3 levels to keep LOX gene in a repressed state. Collectively, this study unravels a role for macroH2A1.2 in regulating osteoclastogenic potential of breast cancer cells, suggesting possibilities for developing therapeutic tools to treat osteolytic bone destruction.",Cell Rep,2018,"['Kim J', 'Shin Y', 'Lee S', 'Kim M', 'Punj V', 'Lu JF', 'Shin H', 'Kim K', 'Ulmer TS', 'Koh J', 'Jeong D', 'An W']"
29968728,LSD1-ERRα complex requires NRF1 to positively regulate transcription and cell invasion.,"Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) exerts dual effects on histone H3, promoting transcriptional repression via Lys4 (H3K4) demethylation or transcriptional activation through Lys9 (H3K9) demethylation. These activities are often exerted at transcriptional start sites (TSSs) and depend on the type of enhancer-bound transcription factor (TFs) with which LSD1 interacts. In particular, the Estrogen-Receptor Related α (ERRα) TF interacts with LSD1 and switches its activities toward H3K9 demethylation, resulting in transcriptional activation of a set of common target genes. However, how are the LSD1-TF and, in particular LSD1-ERRα, complexes determined to act at TSSs is not understood. Here we show that promoter-bound nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), but not ERRα, is essential to LSD1 recruitment at the TSSs of positive LSD1-ERRα targets. In contrast to ERRα, NRF1 does not impact on the nature of LSD1 enzymatic activity. We propose a three factor model, in which the LSD1 histone modifier requires a TSS tethering factor (NRF1) as well as an activity inducer (ERRα) to transcriptionally activate common targets. The relevance of this common network is illustrated by functional data, showing that all three factors are required for cell invasion in an MMP1 (Matrix MetalloProtease 1)-dependent manner, the expression of which is regulated by NRF1/LSD1/ERRα-mediated H3K9me2 demethylation.",Sci Rep,2018,"['Zhang L', 'Carnesecchi J', 'Cerutti C', 'Tribollet V', 'Périan S', 'Forcet C', 'Wong J', 'Vanacker JM']"
29967538,Mechanism of 53BP1 activity regulation by RNA-binding TIRR and a designer protein.,"Dynamic protein interaction networks such as DNA double-strand break (DSB) signaling are modulated by post-translational modifications. The DNA repair factor 53BP1 is a rare example of a protein whose post-translational modification-binding function can be switched on and off. 53BP1 is recruited to DSBs by recognizing histone lysine methylation within chromatin, an activity directly inhibited by the 53BP1-binding protein TIRR. X-ray crystal structures of TIRR and a designer protein bound to 53BP1 now reveal a unique regulatory mechanism in which an intricate binding area centered on an essential TIRR arginine residue blocks the methylated-chromatin-binding surface of 53BP1. A 53BP1 separation-of-function mutation that abolishes TIRR-mediated regulation in cells renders 53BP1 hyperactive in response to DSBs, highlighting the key inhibitory function of TIRR. This 53BP1 inhibition is relieved by TIRR-interacting RNA molecules, providing proof-of-principle of RNA-triggered 53BP1 recruitment to DSBs.",Nat. Struct. Mol.

29964136,An inhibitor screen identifies histone-modifying enzymes as mediators of polymer-mediated transgene expression from plasmid DNA.,"Effective transgene expression in mammalian cells relies on successful delivery, cytoplasmic trafficking, and nuclear translocation of the delivered vector, but delivery is impeded by several formidable physicochemical barriers on the surface of and within the target cell. Although methods to overcome cellular exclusion and endosomal entrapment have been studied extensively, strategies to overcome inefficient nuclear entry and subsequent intranuclear barriers to effective transient gene expression have only been sparsely explored. In particular, the role of nuclear packaging of DNA with histone proteins, which governs endogenous gene expression, has not been extensively elucidated in the case of exogenously delivered plasmids. In this work, a parallel screen of small molecule inhibitors of chromatin-modifying enzymes resulted in the identification of class I/II HDACs, sirtuins, LSD1, HATs, and the methyltransferases EZH2 and MLL as targets whose inhibition led to the enhancement of transgene expression following polymer-mediated delivery of plasmid DNA. Quantitative PCR studies revealed that HDAC inhibition enhances the amount of plasmid DNA delivered to the nucleus in UMUC3 human bladder cancer cells. Native chromatin immunoprecipitation (N-ChIP)-qPCR experiments in CHO-K1 cells indicated that plasmids indeed interact with intracellular core Histone H3, and inhibitors of HDAC and LSD1 proteins are able to modulate this interaction. Pair-wise treatments of effective inhibitors led to synergistic enhancement of transgene expression to varying extents in both cell types.

Dysregulations of histone modifications have been linked to the pathogenesis of diverse human diseases.

We recently developed a highly multiplexed platform, Epigenetic landscape profiling using cytometry by Time-Of-Flight (EpiTOF), to analyze the global levels of a broad array of histone modifications in single cells using mass cytometry.

29957399,Ethanol-induced modulation of GPR55 expression in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells is accompanied by H4K12 acetylation.,"Inflammation supports the progression of alcohol-related organ injury. Recent research findings have linked ethanol exposure to changes in histone acetylation and deacetylation in the brain and in peripheral tissues, leading to ethanol-dependence related damage. One of the mechanisms that has been shown to play a major role during inflammation is the cannabinoid system. Previous research has demonstrated that ethanol can modulate cannabinoid receptors' functions. Our lab has shown that the G protein-coupled receptor (GPR55), a novel cannabinoid receptor, is upregulated in binge drinkers and in cells treated acutely with ethanol. Additionally, our group has also uncovered that chronic ethanol exposure leads to an increase in histone modifications, such as acetylation. However, the regulatory mechanism of GPR55 within the immune system under the influence of ethanol is poorly understood. Since changes in histone modifications might lead to changes in gene expression, we hypothesize that the mechanism of ethanol-induced upregulation of GPR55 is linked to epigenetic changes on histone proteins. Taking into account previous findings from our lab, the goal of the present study was to determine whether there is any relevant association between histone hyperacetylation and the regulation of the novel cannabinoid receptor GPR55 in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) of human origin treated acutely with ethanol. Therefore, monocytes were isolated from buffy coats and allowed to differentiate into MDDCs. The cells were treated with ethanol for 24 h, harvested, fixed, and stained with antibodies against GPR55. As expected, based on previous findings, confocal microscopy showed that ethanol exposure increases GPR55 expression. In order to demonstrate the correlation between histone acetylation and GPR55 expression regulation, the cells were treated with ethanol, harvested, and then the chromatin was extracted and fractionated for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, followed by real-time qPCR for the analysis of DNA fragments. The results showed an enrichment of the histone modification H4K12ac in the GPR55 gene of MDDCs treated with ethanol. Furthermore, siRNA against the histone acetyltransferase Tip60 (responsible for the acetylation of H4K12) resulted in a downregulation of GPR55. In conjunction, these results indicate that in the presence of ethanol, the upregulation of GPR55 expression is accompanied by H4K12 acetylation, which might have a significant effect in the ability of this innate immune system's cells to cope with cellular stress induced by ethanol. However, the causality of ethanol regulation of H4K12ac in GPR55 expression changes still lacks further elucidation; therefore, additional experimental approaches to confirm a significant causality between H4K12 acetylation and ethanol regulation of GPR55 are currently undergoing in our lab.",Alcohol,2018,"['Castillo-Chabeco B', 'Figueroa G', 'Parira T', 'Napuri J', 'Agudelo M']"

Yet, how alterations in H3K4me1 are established and the consequences of these epigenetic changes in tumorigenesis are not well understood. Using ChIP-Seq in human colon cancer cells, we demonstrate that mutant p53 depletion results in decreased H3K4me1 levels at active enhancers that reveal a striking colocalization of mutant p53 and the H3K4 monomethyltransferase MLL4 following chronic tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) signaling. We further reveal that mutant p53 forms physiological associations and direct interactions with MLL4 and promotes the enhancer binding of MLL4, which is required for TNFα-inducible H3K4me1 and histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) levels, enhancer-derived transcript (eRNA) synthesis, and mutant p53-dependent target gene activation.

29954426,The pioneer factor activity of c-Myb involves recruitment of p300 and induction of histone acetylation followed by acetylation-induced chromatin dissociation.,"BACKGROUND: The concept of pioneer transcription factors is emerging as an essential part of the epigenetic regulation, taking place during cell development and differentiation. However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying pioneer factor activity remains poorly understood. We recently reported that the transcription factor c-Myb acts as a pioneer factor in haematopoiesis, and a point mutation in its DNA binding domain, D152V, is able to abrogate this function.
RESULTS: Here, we show that specific histone modifications, including H3K27ac, prevent binding of c-Myb to histone tails, representing a novel effect of histone modifications, namely restricting binding of a pioneer factor to chromatin. Furthermore, we have taken advantage of the pioneer-defect D152V mutant to investigate mechanisms of c-Myb's pioneer factor activity. We show that c-Myb-dependent transcriptional activation of a gene in inaccessible chromatin relies on c-Myb binding to histones, as well as on c-Myb interacting with the histone acetyltransferase p300. ChIP assays show that both wild type and the D152V mutant of c-Myb bind to a selected target gene at its promoter and enhancer, but only wild-type c-Myb causes opening and activation of the locus. Enhancement of histone acetylation restores activation of the same gene in the absence of c-Myb, suggesting that facilitating histone acetylation is a crucial part of the pioneer factor function of c-Myb.
CONCLUSIONS: We suggest a pioneer factor model in which c-Myb binds to regions of closed chromatin and then recruits histone acetyltransferases. By binding to histones, c-Myb facilitates histone acetylation, acting as a cofactor for p300 at c-Myb bound sites. The resulting H3K27ac leads to chromatin opening and detachment of c-Myb from the acetylated chromatin. We propose that the latter phenomenon, acetylation-induced chromatin dissociation, represents a mechanism for controlling the dynamics of pioneer factor binding to chromatin.",Epigenetics Chromatin,2018,"['Fuglerud BM', 'Ledsaak M', 'Rogne M', 'Eskeland R', 'Gabrielsen OS']"

Progress achieved in the last two decades has demonstrated convincingly that ionizing radiation can also target the cellular epigenome.

Chromatin of flowering plants contains four types of H2A variants, which biochemical properties have not been characterized. We report that in contrast with animals, in Arabidopsis thaliana H2A variants define only four major types of homotypic nucleosomes containing exclusively H2A, H2A.Z, H2A.X or H2A.W. In vitro assays show that the L1 loop and the docking domain confer distinct stability of the nucleosome. In vivo and in vitro assays suggest that the L1 loop and the docking domain cooperate with the C-terminal tail to regulate chromatin accessibility. Based on these findings we conclude that the type of H2A variant in the nucleosome impacts on its interaction with DNA and propose that H2A variants regulate the dynamics of chromatin accessibility. In plants, the predominance of homotypic nucleosomes with specific physical properties and their specific localization to distinct domains suggest that H2A variants play a dominant role in chromatin dynamics and function.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2018,"['Osakabe A', 'Lorkovic ZJ', 'Kobayashi W', 'Tachiwana H', 'Yelagandula R', 'Kurumizaka H', 'Berger F']"

29937341,ATRX Promotes DNA Repair Synthesis and Sister Chromatid Exchange during Homologous Recombination.,"ATRX is a chromatin remodeler that, together with its chaperone DAXX, deposits the histone variant H3.3 in pericentromeric and telomeric regions. Notably, ATRX is frequently mutated in tumors that maintain telomere length by a specific form of homologous recombination (HR). Surprisingly, in this context, we demonstrate that ATRX-deficient cells exhibit a defect in repairing exogenously induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by HR. ATRX operates downstream of the Rad51 removal step and interacts with PCNA and RFC-1, which are collectively required for DNA repair synthesis during HR. ATRX depletion abolishes DNA repair synthesis and prevents the formation of sister chromatid exchanges at exogenously induced DSBs. DAXX- and H3.3-depleted cells exhibit identical HR defects as ATRX-depleted cells, and both ATRX and DAXX function to deposit H3.3 during DNA repair synthesis. This suggests that ATRX facilitates the chromatin reconstitution required for extended DNA repair synthesis and sister chromatid exchange during HR.",Mol.

29934321,Drawing on disorder: How viruses use histone mimicry to their advantage.,"Humans carry trillions of viruses that thrive because of their ability to exploit the host. In this exploitation, viruses promote their own replication by suppressing the host antiviral response and by inducing changes in host biosynthetic processes, often with extremely small genomes of their own. In the review, we discuss the phenomenon of histone mimicry by viral proteins and how this mimicry allows the virus to dial in to the cell's transcriptional processes and establish a cell state that promotes infection. We suggest that histone mimicry is part of a broader viral strategy to use intrinsic protein disorder as a means to overcome the size limitations of its own genome and to maximize its impact on host protein networks. In particular, we discuss how intrinsic protein disorder may enable viral proteins to interfere with phase-separated host protein condensates, including those that contribute to chromatin-mediated control of gene expression.",J.

We focus here on associations of epigenetic factors concurrent with depression and depression-like behavior, although risk for depression and some of the associated epigenetic changes are known to have developmental origins.

With the increased frequency of military operations, terror attacks, sports activities, and road mishaps, TBIs are increasingly becoming a serious public health concern. Patients who meet with moderate-to-severe TBI suffer from a constellation of cognitive deficits and phenotypes due to diffuse axonal injury. On the contrary, minimal TBI precipitates in long-term behavioral complications commonly referred to as post-traumatic stress disorders, which consist of depression, anxiety, hallucinations, and so on. During the last decade, epigenetic mechanisms, such as histone posttranslational modifications, DNA methylation, and noncoding RNAs, have received reasonable attention by scientists studying the neurobiology of TBI. Chromatin remodeling sculpted by various epigenetic factors in different parts of the brain controls many intricate processes involved in important neural functions. Although stable and dogmatic, the reversible nature of epigenetic modifications has attracted special attention for their emerging potential in therapeutic development. Herein, we offer an overview of recent observations on epigenetic pathways that are likely involved in shaping neural function and maintain the state of neuropathology in response to traumatic events.",Prog Mol Biol Transl Sci,2018,"['Nagalakshmi B', 'Sagarkar S', 'Sakharkar AJ']"

29925860,MacroH2A1.2 inhibits prostate cancer-induced osteoclastogenesis through cooperation with HP1α and H1.2.,"Osteoclasts are multinuclear bone-resorbing cells that differentiate from hematopoietic precursor cells. Prostate cancer cells frequently spread to bone and secrete soluble signaling factors to accelerate osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. However, processes and mechanisms that govern the expression of osteoclastogenic soluble factors secreted by prostate cancer cells are largely unknown. MacroH2A (mH2A) is a histone variant that replaces canonical H2A at designated genomic loci and establishes functionally distinct chromatin regions. Here, we report that mH2A1.2, one of the mH2A isoforms, attenuates prostate cancer-induced osteoclastogenesis by maintaining the inactive state of genes encoding soluble factors in prostate cancer cells. Our functional analyses of soluble factors identify lymphotoxin beta (LTβ) as a major stimulator of osteoclastogenesis and an essential mH2A1.2 target for its anti-osteoclastogenic activity. Mechanistically, mH2A1.2 directly interacts with HP1α and H1.2 and requires them to inactivate LTβ gene in prostate cancer cells. Consistently, HP1α and H1.2 have an intrinsic ability to inhibit osteoclast differentiation in a mH2A1.2-dependent manner. Together, our data uncover a new and specific role for mH2A1.2 in modulating osteoclastogenic potential of prostate cancer cells and demonstrate how this signaling pathway can be exploited to treat osteolytic bone metastases at the molecular level.",Oncogene,2018,"['Kim JM', 'Shin Y', 'Lee S', 'Kim MY', 'Punj V', 'Shin HI', 'Kim K', 'Koh JM', 'Jeong D', 'An W']"
29921582,Rpp29 regulates histone H3.3 chromatin assembly through transcriptional mechanisms.,"The histone H3 variant H3.3 is a highly conserved and dynamic regulator of chromatin organization. Therefore, fully elucidating its nucleosome incorporation mechanisms is essential to understanding its functions in epigenetic inheritance. We previously identified the RNase P protein subunit, Rpp29, as a repressor of H3.3 chromatin assembly. Here, we use a biochemical assay to show that Rpp29 interacts with H3.3 through a sequence element in its own N terminus, and we identify a novel interaction with histone H2B at an adjacent site. The fact that archaeal Rpp29 does not include this N-terminal region suggests that it evolved to regulate eukaryote-specific functions. Oncogenic H3.3 mutations alter the H3.3-Rpp29 interaction, which suggests that they could dysregulate Rpp29 function in chromatin assembly. We also used KNS42 cells, an H3.3(G34V) pediatric high-grade glioma cell line, to show that Rpp29 1) represses H3.3 incorporation into transcriptionally active protein-coding, rRNA, and tRNA genes; 2) represses mRNA, protein expression, and antisense RNA; and 3) represses euchromatic post-translational modifications (PTMs) and promotes heterochromatic PTM deposition (",J.

It has emerged as an epigenetic developmental regulator and was shown to be involved in carcinogenesis. The functional diversity of KDM1A originates from its complex structure and interactions with transcription factors, promoters, enhancers, oncoproteins, and tumor-associated genes (tumor suppressors and activators). In this review, we discuss the microenvironment of KDM1A in cancer progression that enables this protein to activate or repress target gene expression, thus making it an important epigenetic modifier that regulates the growth and differentiation potential of cells.

29915963,A translational perspective on histone acetylation modulators in psychiatric disorders.,"A large volume of research now provides evidence correlating aberrant histone deacetylase (HDAC) activities and hypoacetylation of histones to disruptions in synaptic plasticity, neuronal survival/regeneration, memory formation and consolidation. Hence, maintaining the acetyl-histone homeostasis as a component of neuronal mechanisms by targeting HDACs has emerged as an exciting intervention strategy for several neuropsychiatric disorders. Though extensive preclinical animal studies have elevated the translational potential of HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) in psychiatric disorders, so far, the translational gain remains low. This is perhaps attributed to the anticipated specificity issues and off-target effects which might negate the risk-reward advantage over the approved antipsychotics in use. So, to harness the therapeutic potential of HDACis in psychiatric disorders, a combination therapeutic strategy involving co-administration of an approved HDAC inhibitor (HDACi) along with a marketed antipsychotic drug has emerged in parallel. This takes advantage of the ability of HDACi, like SAHA, to reverse the potentially detrimental hypoacetylated state of chromatin and facilitate to augment the efficacy of atypical antipsychotics like clozapine. Apart from these efforts, as an alternative therapeutic strategy, highly tolerable oral metabolic acetate supplements with an ability to reverse the hypoacetylation states of histone were initiated in animal models. Exogenous acetate carrier enriches the cellular acetyl-CoA pool restoring acetyl-histone homeostasis, reminiscent of HDACi effect, without the associated toxicity. Though the path towards therapeutic intervention in psychiatric disorders using histone acetylation modulators is riddled with challenges, the growing number of tool compounds along with innovative research strategies, however, bodes well for the future.",Psychopharmacology (Berl.),2018,"['Ganguly S', 'Seth S']"
29906285,Murine leukemia virus p12 tethers the capsid-containing pre-integration complex to chromatin by binding directly to host nucleosomes in mitosis.,"The murine leukaemia virus (MLV) Gag cleavage product, p12, is essential for both early and late steps in viral replication. The N-terminal domain of p12 binds directly to capsid (CA) and stabilises the mature viral core, whereas defects in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of p12 can be rescued by addition of heterologous chromatin binding sequences (CBSs). We and others hypothesised that p12 tethers the pre-integration complex (PIC) to host chromatin ready for integration. Using confocal microscopy, we have observed for the first time that CA localises to mitotic chromatin in infected cells in a p12-dependent manner. GST-tagged p12 alone, however, did not localise to chromatin and mass-spectrometry analysis of its interactions identified only proteins known to bind the p12 region of Gag. Surprisingly, the ability to interact with chromatin was conferred by a single amino acid change, M63I, in the p12 CTD. Interestingly, GST-p12_M63I showed increased phosphorylation in mitosis relative to interphase, which correlated with an increased interaction with mitotic chromatin. Mass-spectrometry analysis of GST-p12_M63I revealed nucleosomal histones as primary interactants. Direct binding of MLV p12_M63I peptides to histones was confirmed by biolayer-interferometry (BLI) assays using highly-avid recombinant poly-nucleosomal arrays. Excitingly, using this method, we also observed binding between MLV p12_WT and nucleosomes. Nucleosome binding was additionally detected with p12 orthologs from feline and gibbon ape leukemia viruses using both pull-down and BLI assays, indicating that this a common feature of gammaretroviral p12 proteins. Importantly, p12 peptides were able to block the binding of the prototypic foamy virus CBS to nucleosomes and vice versa, implying that their docking sites overlap and suggesting a conserved mode of chromatin tethering for different retroviral genera. We propose that p12 is acting in a similar capacity to CPSF6 in HIV-1 infection by facilitating initial chromatin targeting of CA-containing PICs prior to integration.",PLoS Pathog.,2018,"['Wanaguru M', 'Barry DJ', 'Benton DJ', ""O'Reilly NJ"", 'Bishop KN']"
29895970,TRPS1 regulates oestrogen receptor binding and histone acetylation at enhancers.,"The chromatin state is finely tuned to regulate function and specificity for transcription factors such as oestrogen receptor alpha (ER), which contributes to cell growth in breast cancer. ER transcriptional potential is mediated, in large part, by the specific associated proteins and co-factors that interact with it. Despite the identification and characterisation of several ER coregulators, a complete and systematic view of ER-regulating chromatin modifiers is lacking. By exploiting a focused siRNA screen that investigated the requirement for a library of 330 chromatin regulators in ER-mediated cell growth, we find that the NuRD and coREST histone deacetylation complexes are critical for breast cancer cell proliferation. Further, by proteomic and genomics approaches, we discover the transcription factor TRPS1 to be a key interactor of the NuRD and coREST complexes. Interestingly, TRPS1 gene amplification occurs in 28% of human breast tumours and is associated with poor prognosis. We propose that TRPS1 is required to repress spurious binding of ER, where it contributes to the removal of histone acetylation. Our data suggest that TRPS1 is an important ER-associated transcriptional repressor that regulates cell proliferation, chromatin acetylation and ER binding at the chromatin of cis-regulatory elements.",Oncogene,2018,"['Serandour AA', 'Mohammed H', 'Miremadi A', 'Mulder KW', 'Carroll JS']"
29880017,The histone H4 proteoform dynamics in response to SUV4-20 inhibition reveals single molecule mechanisms of inhibitor resistance.,"BACKGROUND: The dynamics of histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) are sparsely described, especially in their true physiological context of proteoforms (single histone molecules harboring combinations of PTMs).
METHODS: Here we time-resolve the response of cells to SUV4-20 methyltransferase inhibition and unbiasedly quantitate the dynamic response of histone H4 PTMs and proteoforms.
RESULTS: Contrary to the prevailing dogma, cells exhibit an immediate-early response with changes to histone proteoforms. Cells also recover to basal-like conditions upon removal of epigenetic inhibitors rapidly. Inhibition of SUV4-20 results in decreased H4{K20me2}; however, no effects on H4{K20me3} are observed, implying that another enzyme mediates H4K20me3. Most surprisingly, SUV4-20 inhibition results in an increase in histone H4 acetylation attributable to proteoforms containing K20me2. This led us to hypothesize that hyperacetylated proteoforms protect K20me2 from demethylation as an evolved compensatory mechanism. This concept is supported by subsequent results that pretreatment with an HDACi substantially diminishes the effects of SUV4-20 inhibition in prone cells and is further confirmed by HATi-facilitating SUV4-20 inhibition to decrease discrete H4{K20me2} in resistant cells.
CONCLUSIONS: The chromatin response of cells to sudden perturbations is significantly faster, nuanced and complex than previously described. The persistent nature of chromatin regulation may be achieved by a network of dynamic equilibria with compensatory mechanisms that operate at the proteoform level.",Epigenetics Chromatin,2018,"['Wang T', 'Holt MV', 'Young NL']"

Recent mechanistic studies pairing chemical tool compounds and deep-sequencing technology have greatly broadened our understanding of epigenetic regulation in glioma progression and underpinned alternative treatment of epigenetic inhibitors. However, the effect of most inhibitors is condition-dependent, and the overall results of clinical trials still have not been applied to patients. There is an intense need to develop more potent and specific compounds as well as identify the population who may achieve clinical benefits. Besides, combination therapy with conventional therapeutics is another alternative strategy.

29864144,Impact of OGT deregulation on EZH2 target genes FOXA1 and FOXC1 expression in breast cancer cells.,"Enhancer of zest homolog 2 (EZH2) is a histone methyltransferase which plays a crucial role in cancer progression by regulation of genes involved in cellular processes such as proliferation, invasion and self-renewal. Activity and biological function of EZH2 are regulated by posttranslational modifications. It is suggested that EZH2 stability may be regulated by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), which is an enzyme catalyzing the addition of GlcNAc moieties to target proteins. In this study, we determined the impact of OGT on expression of EZH2 target genes FOXA1 and FOXC1, that are involved in breast cancer progression. The results of chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that both EZH2 and OGT are targeted to the promoter regions of FOXA1 and FOXC1 and knockdown of EZH2 or OGT affects expression of studied genes in breast non-malignant (MCF10A) and cancer cells (MCF7, T47D and MDA-MB-231). The results showed that OGT silencing affects EZH2 binding to FOXC1 promoter but the effect is cell-context dependent. Despite the slight decrease in EZH2 protein level in cells with OGT depletion, EZH2 binding to FOXC1 was increased. Moreover, OGT binding to promoter regions of FOXA1 and FOXC1 was increased in cells with knockdown of EZH2. Increased expression of FOXA1 and FOXC1 in cells with OGT deregulation was associated with increased acetylation level of histone H3. The results suggest that OGT is involved in regulation of FOXA1 and FOXC1 expression but its role is not associated with regulation of EZH2 protein stability.",PLoS ONE,2018,"['Forma E', 'Jóźwiak P', 'Ciesielski P', 'Zaczek A', 'Starska K', 'Bryś M', 'Krześlak A']"
29858375,Understanding the Histone DNA Repair Code: H4K20me2 Makes Its Mark.,"Chromatin is a highly compact structure that must be rapidly rearranged in order for DNA repair proteins to access sites of damage and facilitate timely and efficient repair. Chromatin plasticity is achieved through multiple processes, including the posttranslational modification of histone tails. In recent years, the impact of histone posttranslational modification on the DNA damage response has become increasingly well recognized, and chromatin plasticity has been firmly linked to efficient DNA repair. One particularly important histone posttranslational modification process is methylation. Here, we focus on the regulation and function of H4K20 methylation (H4K20me) in the DNA damage response and describe the writers, erasers, and readers of this important chromatin mark as well as the combinatorial histone posttranslational modifications that modulate H4K20me recognition. Finally, we discuss the central role of H4K20me in determining if DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) are repaired by the error-prone, nonhomologous DNA end joining pathway or the error-free, homologous recombination pathway. This review article discusses the regulation and function of H4K20me2 in DNA DSB repair and outlines the components and modifications that modulate this important chromatin mark and its fundamental impact on DSB repair pathway choice.

29846670,PHD finger protein 1 (PHF1) is a novel reader for histone H4R3 symmetric dimethylation and coordinates with PRMT5-WDR77/CRL4B complex to promote tumorigenesis.,"Histone post-translational modifications regulate chromatin structure and function largely through interactions with effector proteins that often contain multiple histone-binding domains. PHF1 [plant homeodomain (PHD) finger protein 1], which contains two kinds of histone reader modules, a Tudor domain and two PHD fingers, is an essential factor for epigenetic regulation and genome maintenance. While significant progress has been made in characterizing the function of the Tudor domain, the roles of the two PHD fingers are poorly defined. Here, we demonstrated that the N-terminal PHD finger of PHF1 recognizes symmetric dimethylation of H4R3 (H4R3me2s) catalyzed by PRMT5-WDR77. However, the C-terminal PHD finger of PHF1, instead of binding to modified histones, directly interacts with DDB1, the main component of the CUL4B-Ring E3 ligase complex (CRL4B), which is responsible for H2AK119 mono-ubiquitination (H2AK119ub1). We showed that PHF1, PRMT5-WDR77, and CRL4B reciprocally interact with one another and collaborate as a functional unit. Genome-wide analysis of PHF1/PRMT5/CUL4B targets identified a cohort of genes including E-cadherin and FBXW7, which are critically involved in cell growth and migration. We demonstrated that PHF1 promotes cell proliferation, invasion, and tumorigenesis in vivo and in vitro and found that its expression is markedly upregulated in a variety of human cancers. Our data identified a new reader for H4R3me2s and provided a molecular basis for the functional interplay between histone arginine methylation and ubiquitination.

We show that increasing expression of Cbx7 inhibits the proliferation of DIPG cells and prolongs its residence time. Our results highlight that the residence time of PcG proteins directly correlates with their functions and the search time of PcG proteins is critical for regulating their genomic occupancy.

The γ-H2AX foci assay was used to determine equi-effect doses or activity, and gene expression analysis was carried out at similar levels of foci induction. Comparative gene expression analysis was performed employing whole human genome DNA microarrays. Candidate genes had to show significant expression changes and no altered gene regulation or opposite regulation after exposure to the radiation quality to be compared. The gene expression of all candidate genes was validated by quantitative real-time PCR. The functional categorization of significantly deregulated genes revealed that chromatin organization and apoptosis were generally affected. After exposure to 123IUdR, α-particles and γ-rays, at equi-effect doses/activity, 155, 316 and 982 genes were exclusively regulated, respectively.

A critical signal indicative of bipolar attachment is tension between cohesion-linked sister chromatids. Key components of the tension signaling apparatus include the Shugoshin family of proteins and the tension sensing motif of histone H3. Shugoshin proteins are recruited to chromatin to create discrete domains integral to tension sensing. Many factors involved in the chromatin association of Shugoshin proteins are well established, most strikingly through modifications found directly on centromeric and pericentric chromatin. It has been well established that phosphorylation at the centromere is essential to nucleating Shugoshin recruitment, but recent evidence revealed a role for pericentric histones and acetylation in modulating Shugoshin recruitment and activity. These data demonstrate that chromatins are not simply passive cargo during mitosis, but are instead actively involved in their segregation.",Curr. Genet.,2018,"['Buehl CJ', 'Kuo MH']"

RESULTS: Elevated global histone H3 acetylation level was observed in type 1 diabetes patients, with 607 differentially acetylated genes identified between type 1 diabetes patients and controls by chromatin immunoprecipitation linked to microarrays. The hyperacetylated genes were enriched in biological processes involved in immune cell activation and inflammatory response. Gene-specific assessments showed that increased transcription of inducible T-cell costimulator was in concordance with the elevated acetylation in its gene promoter, along with positive correlation with glutamate decarboxylase antibody titer in type 1 diabetes patients.

29789597,Enhancer of zeste homolog 2-catalysed H3K27 trimethylation plays a key role in acute-on-chronic liver failure via TNF-mediated pathway.,"Acute-on-chronic liver failure is mainly due to host immunity self-destruction. The histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) trimethylating enzyme, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) mediates epigenetic silencing of gene expression and regulates immunity, also involves pathogenesis of several liver diseases. The current study was to determine the role of methyltransferase EZH2 and its catalysed H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) in liver failure, and to further investigate the potential target for liver failure treatment. EZH2 and its catalysed H3K27me3 were determined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from liver failure patients and Kupffer cells from experimental mice. Furthermore, GSK126 (an inhibitor for EZH2 trimethylation function) was applied in liver failure mice in vivo, and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mononuclear cells in vitro. EZH2 and H3K27me3 were significantly upregulated in human PBMC from liver failure patients or murine Kupffer cells from the liver failure animals, respectively. GSK126 ameliorated disease severity in liver failure mice, which maybe attribute to down-regulate circulating and hepatic proinflammatory cytokines, especially TNF via reducing H3K27me3. In-depth chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis unravelled that decreased enrichment of H3K27me3 on Tnf promotor, resulting in TNF elevation in Kupffer cells from liver failure mice. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and protein kinase B (Akt) signalling pathways were activated upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation, but attenuated by using GSK126, accompanied with decreased TNF in vitro. In conclusion, EZH2 and H3K27me3 contributed to the pathogenesis of liver failure via triggering TNF and other indispensable proinflammatory cytokines. EZH2 was to modify H3K27me3 enrichment, as well as, activation of the downstream NF-κB and Akt signalling pathways.",Cell Death Dis,2018,"['Zhou T', 'Sun Y', 'Li M', 'Ding Y', 'Yin R', 'Li Z', 'Xie Q', 'Bao S', 'Cai W']"
29789539,Proteasomal degradation of the histone acetyl transferase p300 contributes to beta-cell injury in a diabetes environment.,"In type 2 diabetes, amyloid oligomers, chronic hyperglycemia, lipotoxicity, and pro-inflammatory cytokines are detrimental to beta-cells, causing apoptosis and impaired insulin secretion. The histone acetyl transferase p300, involved in remodeling of chromatin structure by epigenetic mechanisms, is a key ubiquitous activator of the transcriptional machinery. In this study, we report that loss of p300 acetyl transferase activity and expression leads to beta-cell apoptosis, and most importantly, that stress situations known to be associated with diabetes alter p300 levels and functional integrity. We found that proteasomal degradation is the mechanism subserving p300 loss in beta-cells exposed to hyperglycemia or pro-inflammatory cytokines. We also report that melatonin, a hormone produced in the pineal gland and known to play key roles in beta-cell health, preserves p300 levels altered by these toxic conditions. Collectively, these data imply an important role for p300 in the pathophysiology of diabetes.",Cell Death Dis,2018,"['Ruiz L', 'Gurlo T', 'Ravier MA', 'Wojtusciszyn A', 'Mathieu J', 'Brown MR', 'Broca C', 'Bertrand G', 'Butler PC', 'Matveyenko AV', 'Dalle S', 'Costes S']"
29789391,MST2 kinase suppresses rDNA transcription in response to DNA damage by phosphorylating nucleolar histone H2B.,"The heavily transcribed rDNA repeats that give rise to the ribosomal RNA are clustered in a unique chromatin structure, the nucleolus. Due to its highly repetitive nature and transcriptional activity, the nucleolus is considered a hotspot of genomic instability. Breaks in rDNA induce a transient transcriptional shut down to conserve energy and promote rDNA repair; however, how nucleolar chromatin is modified and impacts on rDNA repair is unknown. Here, we uncover that phosphorylation of serine 14 on histone H2B marks transcriptionally inactive nucleolar chromatin in response to DNA damage. We identified that the MST2 kinase localises at the nucleoli and targets phosphorylation of H2BS14p in an ATM-dependent manner. We show that establishment of H2BS14p is necessary for damage-induced rDNA transcriptional shut down and maintenance of genomic integrity. Ablation of MST2 kinase, or upstream activators, results in defective establishment of nucleolar H2BS14p, perturbed DNA damage repair, sensitisation to rDNA damage and increased cell lethality. We highlight the impact of chromatin regulation in the rDNA damage response and targeting of the nucleolus as an emerging cancer therapeutic approach.",EMBO J.,2018,"['Pefani DE', 'Tognoli ML', 'Pirincci Ercan D', 'Gorgoulis V', ""O'Neill E""]"

29782530,Histone methylation changes are required for life cycle progression in the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni.,"Epigenetic mechanisms and chromatin structure play an important role in development. Their impact is therefore expected to be strong in parasites with complex life cycles and multiple, strikingly different, developmental stages, i.e. developmental plasticity. Some studies have already described how the chromatin structure, through histone modifications, varies from a developmental stage to another in a few unicellular parasites. While H3K4me3 profiles remain relatively constant, H3K27 trimethylation and bivalent methylation show strong variation. Inhibitors (A366 and GSK343) of H3K27 histone methyltransferase activity in S. mansoni efficiently blocked miracidium to sporocyst transition indicating that H3K27 trimethylation is required for life cycle progression. As S. mansoni is a multicellular parasite that significantly affects both the health and economy of endemic areas, a better understanding of fluke developmental processes within the definitive host will likely highlight novel disease control strategies. Towards this goal, we also studied H4K20me1 in female cercariae and adults. In particular, we found that bivalent trimethylation of H3K4 and H3K27 at the transcription start site of genes is a landmark of the cercarial stage. In cercariae, H3K27me3 presence and strong enrichment in H4K20me1 over long regions (10-100 kb) is associated with development related genes. Here, we provide a broad overview of the chromatin structure of a metazoan parasite throughout its most important lifecycle stages. The five developmental stages studied here present distinct chromatin structures, indicating that histone methylation plays an important role during development. Hence, components of the histone methylation (and demethylation) machinery may provide suitable Schistosomiasis control targets.",PLoS Pathog.,2018,"['Roquis D', 'Taudt A', 'Geyer KK', 'Padalino G', 'Hoffmann KF', 'Holroyd N', 'Berriman M', 'Aliaga B', 'Chaparro C', 'Grunau C', 'Augusto RC']"
29777275,Overexpression of ABCB4 contributes to acquired doxorubicin resistance in breast cancer cells in vitro.,"PURPOSE: Doxorubicin is one of the most active agents in the first-line therapy for metastatic breast cancer, but its utility is partially limited by the frequent emergence of doxorubicin resistance. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of ATP-binding cassette sub-family B, member 4 (ABCB4) in acquired doxorubicin resistance in breast cancer cells, as well as its potential mechanism.
METHODS: In doxorubicin-sensitive and -resistant breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, the expression levels of ABCB4 were detected using real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis, the DNA methylation and histone acetylation status of ABCB4 gene were investigated by bisulfite-sequencing PCR (BSP) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, and the doxorubicin sensitivity and intracellular doxorubicin accumulation were observed using cell cytotoxicity assay and flow cytometry. In Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCKII) cells, In vitro transport assay was used to assess the ABCB4-mediated transport of doxorubicin.
RESULTS: ABCB4 was overexpressed in doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer cells compared to their doxorubicin-sensitive counterparts, which was associated with reduced DNA methylation as well as increased histone acetylation at the ABCB4 promoter. ABCB4 could actively pump doxorubicin out of the cells, and knockdown of ABCB4 increased doxorubicin sensitivity and intracellular accumulation in doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that ABCB4 is overexpressed in breast cancer cells with acquired doxorubicin resistance, which could be attributed, at least partially, to the epigenetic modifications of ABCB4 gene. ABCB4 mediates the efflux transport of doxorubicin, and contributes to the acquired resistance of doxorubicin in breast cancer cells.",Cancer Chemother.

Here we consider, as a model, the metabolically-driven dynamics of H3K4me3, a histone methylation mark that is known to encode information about active transcription, cell identity, and tumor suppression. We analyze the genome-wide changes in H3K4me3 and gene expression in response to alterations in methionine availability in both normal mouse physiology and human cancer cells. Surprisingly, we find that the location of H3K4me3 peaks is largely preserved under methionine restriction, while the response of H3K4me3 peak width encodes almost all aspects of H3K4me3 biology including changes in expression levels, and the presence of cell identity and cancer-associated genes. These findings may reveal general principles for how nutrient availability modulates specific aspects of chromatin dynamics to mediate biological function.",Nat Commun,2018,"['Dai Z', 'Mentch SJ', 'Gao X', 'Nichenametla SN', 'Locasale JW']"

To address complex multidimensional relationship and reveal epigenetic regulation of RA, we perform integrative analyses using a novel unbiased method to identify genomic regions with similar profiles. Epigenomically similar regions exist in RA cells and are associated with active enhancers and promoters and specific transcription factor binding motifs. Differentially marked genes are enriched for immunological and unexpected pathways, with ""Huntington's Disease Signaling"" identified as particularly prominent. We validate the relevance of this pathway to RA by showing that Huntingtin-interacting protein-1 regulates FLS invasion into matrix.

In this study, we found that reduction in H3K27me2/3 caused by H3.1K27M, a mutation of H3 variants found in patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), dramatically attenuated the presence of 53BP1 (also known as TP53BP1) foci and the capability of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in human dermal fibroblasts. H3.1K27M mutant cells showed increased rates of genomic insertions/deletions and copy number variations, as well as an increase in p53-dependent apoptosis. We further showed that both hypo-H3K27me2/3 and H3.1K27M interacted with FANCD2, a central player in the choice of DNA repair pathway. H3.1K27M triggered the accumulation of FANCD2 on chromatin, suggesting an interaction between H3.1K27M and FANCD2. Interestingly, knockdown of FANCD2 in H3.1K27M cells recovered the number of 53BP1-positive foci, NHEJ efficiency and apoptosis rate. Although these findings in HDF cells may differ from the endogenous regulation of the H3.1K27M mutant in the specific tumor context of DIPG, our results suggest a new model by which H3K27me2/3 facilitates NHEJ and the maintenance of genome stability.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.",J.

In metazoans, coherent regulation of gene expression programs underlies the development of functionally distinct cell lineages. The cooperation between transcription factors and the chromatin landscape enables precise control of gene expression in response to cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic signals. Many of the chemical modifications that decorate DNA and histones are adducts derived from intermediates of cellular metabolic pathways. In addition, several of the enzymes that can remove these marks use metabolites as part of their enzymatic reaction. These observations have led to the hypothesis that fluctuations in metabolite levels influence the deposition and removal of chromatin modifications. In this review, we consider the emerging evidence that cellular metabolic activity contributes to gene expression and cell fate decisions through metabolite-dependent effects on chromatin organization.",J.

29759984,"NDF, a nucleosome-destabilizing factor that facilitates transcription through nucleosomes.","Our understanding of transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is limited by our knowledge of the factors that mediate this critically important process. Here we describe the identification of NDF, a nucleosome-destabilizing factor that facilitates Pol II transcription in chromatin. NDF has a PWWP motif, interacts with nucleosomes near the dyad, destabilizes nucleosomes in an ATP-independent manner, and facilitates transcription by Pol II through nucleosomes in a purified and defined transcription system as well as in cell nuclei. Upon transcriptional induction, NDF is recruited to the transcribed regions of thousands of genes and colocalizes with a subset of H3K36me3-enriched regions. Notably, the recruitment of NDF to gene bodies is accompanied by an increase in the transcript levels of many of the NDF-enriched genes. In addition, the global loss of NDF results in a decrease in the RNA levels of many genes. In humans, NDF is present at high levels in all tested tissue types, is essential in stem cells, and is frequently overexpressed in breast cancer. These findings indicate that NDF is a nucleosome-destabilizing factor that is recruited to gene bodies during transcriptional activation and facilitates Pol II transcription through nucleosomes.",Genes Dev.,2018,"['Fei J', 'Ishii H', 'Hoeksema MA', 'Meitinger F', 'Kassavetis GA', 'Glass CK', 'Ren B', 'Kadonaga JT']"

In contrast, among IRF1 sites lacking concomitant STAT1 recruitment, only 25% underwent inducible histone acetylation, 31% exhibited constitutive histone acetylation, and 44% had no histone acetylation.

29743404,[Epigenetic aberrations in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and development of a novel EZH1/2 inhibitor].,"Histone H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) -dependent transcription regulation is a fundamental process of gene control. Although EZH2 mutation is observed in certain lymphoma types, many other cancers show global H3K27me3 accumulation irrespective of mutation. However, the underlying mechanisms of gene silencing and therapeutic efficacies of epigenetic drugs remain unclear. In this study, we showed that globally-accumulated H3K27me3 is induced by both cis-bound EZH1 and EZH2 in mature lymphocyte-derived malignancies. Mutual interference and compensatory functions of co-expressed EZH1/2 rearrange the genome-wide distribution, establishing restricted chromatin and gene expression signatures. Using novel EZH1/2 dual inhibitors, we found that both EZH1 and EZH2 are required for the maintenance and induction of H3K27me3. The synthetic lethality of targeting EZH1 and EZH2 was observed in lymphoma models and primary adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) cells harboring H3K27me3 accumulation. This heritable EZH1/2 dysfunctional state was epigenetically imprinted at the virus-infected, immortalized phase. EZH1/2 dual inhibition could eliminate infected cell populations more effectively than EZH2 inhibition. Regarding the frequent observation of H3K27me3 accumulation in advanced-stage and early-phase malignant progenitors, the emerging EZH1- and EZH2-dependent epigenetic reprograming is an incipient process of fate decision within developmental pathways of cancers.",Rinsho Ketsueki,2018,['Yamagishi M']
29743367,A Screen for Epstein-Barr Virus Proteins That Inhibit the DNA Damage Response Reveals a Novel Histone Binding Protein.,"To replicate and persist in human cells, linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), must overcome the host DNA damage response (DDR) that is triggered by the viral genomes. Since this response is necessary to maintain cellular genome integrity, its inhibition by EBV is likely an important factor in the development of cancers associated with EBV infection, including gastric carcinoma. Here we present the first extensive screen of EBV proteins that inhibit dsDNA break signaling. We identify the BKRF4 tegument protein as a DDR inhibitor that interferes with histone ubiquitylation at dsDNA breaks and recruitment of the RNF168 histone ubiquitin ligase. We further show that BKRF4 binds directly to histones through an acidic domain that targets BKRF4 to cellular chromatin and is sufficient to inhibit dsDNA break signaling. BKRF4 transcripts were detected in EBV-positive gastric carcinoma cells (AGS-EBV), and these increased in lytic infection. Silencing of BKRF4 in both latent and lytic AGS-EBV cells (but not in EBV-negative AGS cells) resulted in increased dsDNA break signaling, confirming a role for BKRF4 in DDR inhibition in the context of EBV infection and suggesting that BKRF4 is expressed in latent cells. BKRF4 was also found to be consistently expressed in EBV-positive gastric tumors in the absence of a full lytic infection. The results suggest that BKRF4 plays a role in inhibiting the cellular DDR in latent and lytic EBV infection and that the resulting accumulation of DNA damage might contribute to development of gastric carcinoma.",J.

29735693,Deubiquitinating enzyme USP3 controls CHK1 chromatin association and activation.,"Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), a Ser/Thr protein kinase, is modified by the K63-linked ubiquitin chain in response to genotoxic stress, which promotes its nuclear localization, chromatin association, and activation. Interestingly, this bulky modification is linked to a critical residue, K132, at the kinase active site. It is unclear how this modification affects the kinase activity and how it is removed to enable the release of CHK1 from chromatin. Herein, we show that the K63-linked ubiquitin chain at CHK1's K132 residue has an inhibitory effect on the kinase activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this modification can be removed by ubiquitin-specific protease 3 (USP3), a deubiquitinating enzyme that targets K63-linked ubiquitin chains. Wild-type USP3, but not the catalytically defective or nuclear localization sequence-deficient mutants, reduced CHK1 K63-linked ubiquitination. Conversely, USP3 knockdown elevated K63-linked ubiquitination of the kinase, leading to prolonged CHK1 chromatin association and phosphorylation. Paradoxically, by removing the bulky ubiquitin chain at the active site, USP3 also increased the accessibility of CHK1 to its substrates. Thus, our findings on the dual roles of USP3 (namely, one to release CHK1 from the chromatin and the other to open up the active site) provide further insights into the regulation of CHK1 following DNA damage.",Proc.

Depletion of Pygo2 arrested SKOV-3 cells at metaphase, which resulted from the failure of chromosomes to capture spindle microtubules, a critical step for chromosomal biorientation and segregation. This observation was consistent with global chromatin association findings in HeLa S3 cells, revealing the enrichment of Pygo2 and MYC at promoters of biorientation and segmentation genes, at which Pygo2 maintained histone H3K27 acetylation. Immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays demonstrated MYC and Pygo2 interacting in nuclei, corroborated in a heterologous MYC-driven prostate cancer model that was distinct from Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

Of note, C/EBPβ, an independent prognostic factor for patients with ovarian cancer, mediates an important mechanism through which epigenetic enzyme modifies groups of functionally related genes in a context-dependent manner. By recruiting the methyltransferase DOT1L, C/EBPβ can maintain an open chromatin state by H3K79 methylation of multiple drug-resistance genes, thereby augmenting the chemoresistance of tumor cells.

Here we demonstrate that HOTTIP, a lincRNA transcribed from the 5' edge of the HOXA locus, physically associates with the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) that serves as an insulator by organizing HOXA cluster into disjoint domains, to cooperatively maintain the chromatin modifications of HOXA genes and thus coordinate the transcriptional activation of distal HOXA genes in human foreskin fibroblasts. Our results reveal the functional connection of HOTTIP and CTCF, and shed light on lincRNAs in gene activation and CTCF mediated chromatin organization.",Biochem. Biophys. Res.

29697540,Ketone bodies as epigenetic modifiers.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Ketone body metabolism is a dynamic and integrated metabolic node in human physiology, whose roles include but extend beyond alternative fuel provision during carbohydrate restriction. Here we discuss the most recent observations suggesting that ketosis coordinates cellular function via epigenomic regulation.
RECENT FINDINGS: Ketosis has been linked to covalent modifications, including lysine acetylation, methylation, and hydroxybutyrylation, to key histones that serve as dynamic regulators of chromatin architecture and gene transcription. Although it remains to be fully established whether these changes to the epigenome are attributable to ketone bodies themselves or other aspects of ketotic states, the regulated genes mediate classical responses to carbohydrate restriction.
SUMMARY: Direct regulation of gene expression may occur in-vivo via through ketone body-mediated histone modifications during adherence to low-carbohydrate diets, fasting ketosis, exogenous ketone body therapy, and diabetic ketoacidosis. Additional convergent functional genomics, metabolomics, and proteomics studies are required in both animal models and in humans to identify the molecular mechanisms through which ketosis regulates nuclear signaling events in a myriad of conditions relevant to disease, and the contexts in which the benefits of ketosis might outweigh the risks.",Curr Opin Clin Nutr Metab Care,2018,"['Ruan HB', 'Crawford PA']"
29697538,The molecular signature of muscle stem cells is driven by nutrient availability and innate cell metabolism.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To discuss how innate muscle stem-cell metabolism and nutrient availability can provide temporal regulation of chromatin accessibility and transcription.
RECENT FINDINGS: Fluorescence-activated cell sorting coupled with whole transcriptome sequencing revealed for the first time that quiescent and proliferating skeletal muscle stem cells exhibit a process of metabolic reprogramming, from fatty-acid oxidation during quiescence to glycolysis during proliferation. Using a combination of immunofluorescence and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, this shift in metabolism has been linked to altered availability of key metabolites essential for histone (de)acetylation and (de)methylation, including acetyl-CoA, s-adenosylmethionine and α-ketoglutarate. Importantly, these changes in metabolite availability have been linked to muscle stem-cell function.
SUMMARY: Together, these results provide greater insight into how muscle stem cells interact with their local environment, with important implications for metabolic diseases, skeletal muscle regeneration and cell-transplantation therapies.",Curr Opin Clin Nutr Metab Care,2018,"['Ryall JG', 'Lynch GS']"
29687888,Epigenetics of Aberrant Cardiac Wound Healing.,"Remodeling of cardiac tissue architecture is essential for normal organ development and maintaining homeostasis after injury. Injurious insults to the heart, such as hypertension and myocardial infarction, promote cellular responses including stimulation of resident inflammatory cells, activation of endothelial cells and recruitment of immune cells, hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes, and activation of fibroblasts. The physiological goal of this coordinated cellular response is to repair damaged tissue while maintaining or restoring cardiac contractile function. Persistent uncontrolled inflammation, hypertrophy, and fibrosis in the heart due to hyperactive wound healing are detrimental and impair cardiac performance, facilitating the progression to heart failure. Abnormal changes in gene expression promote acquisition of aberrant cellular phenotypes that drive cardiac remodeling. DNA methylation and histone modifications are epigenetic mechanisms that critically regulate chromatin structure and gene expression, and are essential for normal physiology and development. Increasing clinical and experimental evidence suggests that these epigenetic mechanisms are involved in driving aberrant wound healing and the development of heart failure. While most of our knowledge to date is on the heart as a whole, the precise contribution of DNA methylation and histone modifications in regulating aberrant cardiac remodeling at the cellular level is less defined. Therefore, this overview aims to summarize the role of DNA methylation and histone modifications (acetylation and methylation) in heart failure and to comprehensively dissect the role these mechanisms play in regulating the function of cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and immune cells in response to injury. © 2018 American Physiological Society.

29686321,Chromatin conformation regulates the coordination between DNA replication and transcription.,"Chromatin is the template for the basic processes of replication and transcription, making the maintenance of chromosomal integrity critical for cell viability. To elucidate how dividing cells respond to alterations in chromatin structure, here we analyse the replication programme of primary cells with altered chromatin configuration caused by the genetic ablation of the HMGB1 gene, or three histone H1 genes. We find that loss of chromatin compaction in H1-depleted cells triggers the accumulation of stalled forks and DNA damage as a consequence of transcription-replication conflicts. In contrast, reductions in nucleosome occupancy due to the lack of HMGB1 cause faster fork progression without impacting the initiation landscape or fork stability. Thus, perturbations in chromatin integrity elicit a range of responses in the dynamics of DNA replication and transcription, with different consequences on replicative stress. These findings have broad implications for our understanding of how defects in chromatin structure contribute to genomic instability.",Nat Commun,2018,"['Almeida R', 'Fernández-Justel JM', 'Santa-María C', 'Cadoret JC', 'Cano-Aroca L', 'Lombraña R', 'Herranz G', 'Agresti A', 'Gómez M']"
29681499,Allosteric Activation Dictates PRC2 Activity Independent of Its Recruitment to Chromatin.,"PRC2 is a therapeutic target for several types of cancers currently undergoing clinical trials. Its activity is regulated by a positive feedback loop whereby its terminal enzymatic product, H3K27me3, is specifically recognized and bound by an aromatic cage present in its EED subunit. The ensuing allosteric activation of the complex stimulates H3K27me3 deposition on chromatin. Here we report a stepwise feedback mechanism entailing key residues within distinctive interfacing motifs of EZH2 or EED that are found to be mutated in cancers and/or Weaver syndrome. PRC2 harboring these EZH2 or EED mutants manifested little activity in vivo but, unexpectedly, exhibited similar chromatin association as wild-type PRC2, indicating an uncoupling of PRC2 activity and recruitment. With genetic and chemical tools, we demonstrated that targeting allosteric activation overrode the gain-of-function effect of EZH2",Mol.

29681498,Distinct Stimulatory Mechanisms Regulate the Catalytic Activity of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2.,"The maintenance of gene expression patterns during metazoan development is achieved, in part, by the actions of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). PRC2 catalyzes mono-, di-, and trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27), with H3K27me2/3 being strongly associated with silenced genes. We demonstrate that EZH1 and EZH2, the two mutually exclusive catalytic subunits of PRC2, are differentially activated by various mechanisms. Whereas both PRC2-EZH1 and PRC2-EZH2 are able to catalyze mono- and dimethylation, only PRC2-EZH2 is strongly activated by allosteric modulators and specific chromatin substrates to catalyze trimethylation of H3K27 in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). However, we also show that a PRC2-associated protein, AEBP2, can stimulate the activity of both complexes through a mechanism independent of and additive to allosteric activation. These results have strong implications regarding the cellular requirements for and the accompanying adjustments in PRC2 activity, given the differential expression of EZH1 and EZH2 upon cellular differentiation.",Mol.

29679095,Implication of the VRK1 chromatin kinase in the signaling responses to DNA damage: a therapeutic target?,"DNA damage causes a local distortion of chromatin that triggers the sequential processes that participate in specific DNA repair mechanisms. This initiation of the repair response requires the involvement of a protein whose activity can be regulated by histones. Kinases are candidates to regulate and coordinate the connection between a locally altered chromatin and the response initiating signals that lead to identification of the type of lesion and the sequential steps required in specific DNA damage responses (DDR). This initiating kinase must be located in chromatin, and be activated independently of the type of DNA damage. We review the contribution of the Ser-Thr vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1) chromatin kinase as a new player in the signaling of DNA damage responses, at chromatin and cellular levels, and its potential as a new therapeutic target in oncology. VRK1 is involved in the regulation of histone modifications, such as histone phosphorylation and acetylation, and in the formation of γH2AX, NBS1 and 53BP1 foci induced in DDR. Induction of DNA damage by chemotherapy or radiation is a mainstay of cancer treatment. Therefore, novel treatments can be targeted to proteins implicated in the regulation of DDR, rather than by directly causing DNA damage.",Cell. Mol. Life Sci.,2018,"['Campillo-Marcos I', 'Lazo PA']"
29672735,Parallel factor ChIP provides essential internal control for quantitative differential ChIP-seq.,"A key challenge in quantitative ChIP combined with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) is the normalization of data in the presence of genome-wide changes in occupancy. Analysis-based normalization methods were developed for transcriptomic data and these are dependent on the underlying assumption that total transcription does not change between conditions. For genome-wide changes in transcription factor (TF) binding, these assumptions do not hold true. The challenges in normalization are confounded by experimental variability during sample preparation, processing and recovery. We present a novel normalization strategy utilizing an internal standard of unchanged peaks for reference. Our method can be readily applied to monitor genome-wide changes by ChIP-seq that are otherwise lost or misrepresented through analytical normalization. We compare our approach to normalization by total read depth and two alternative methods that utilize external experimental controls to study TF binding. We successfully resolve the key challenges in quantitative ChIP-seq analysis and demonstrate its application by monitoring the loss of Estrogen Receptor-alpha (ER) binding upon fulvestrant treatment, ER binding in response to estrodiol, ER mediated change in H4K12 acetylation and profiling ER binding in patient-derived xenographs.

29667342,Middle-Down Characterization of the Cell Cycle Dependence of Histone H4 Posttranslational Modifications and Proteoforms.,"Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histones are important epigenetic regulatory mechanisms that are often dysregulated in cancer. We employ middle-down proteomics to investigate the PTMs and proteoforms of histone H4 during cell cycle progression. We use pH gradient weak cation exchange-hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (WCX-HILIC) for on-line liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis to separate and analyze the proteoforms of histone H4. This procedure provides enhanced separation of proteoforms, including positional isomers, and simplifies downstream data analysis. We use ultrahigh mass accuracy and resolution Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer to unambiguously distinguish between acetylation and tri-methylation (∆m = 0.036 Da). In total, we identify and quantify 233 proteoforms of histone H4 in two breast cancer cell lines. We observe significant increases in S1 phosphorylation during mitosis, implicating an important role in mitotic chromatin condensation. A decrease of K20 unmodified proteoforms is observed as the cell cycle progresses, corresponding to an increase of K20 mono- and di-methylation. Acetylation at K5, K8, K12, and K16 declines as cells traverse from S phase to mitosis, suggesting cell cycle-dependence and an important role during chromatin replication and condensation. These new insights into the epigenetics of the cell cycle may provide new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.",Proteomics,2018,"['Jiang T', 'Hoover ME', 'Holt MV', 'Freitas MA', 'Marshall AG', 'Young NL']"

29665865,Integrative analysis reveals functional and regulatory roles of H3K79me2 in mediating alternative splicing.,"BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence suggests alternative splicing (AS) is a co-transcriptional splicing process not only controlled by RNA-binding splicing factors, but also mediated by epigenetic regulators, such as chromatin structure, nucleosome density, and histone modification. Aberrant AS plays an important role in regulating various diseases, including cancers.
METHODS: In this study, we integrated AS events derived from RNA-seq with H3K79me2 ChIP-seq data across 34 different normal and cancer cell types and found the higher enrichment of H3K79me2 in two AS types, skipping exon (SE) and alternative 3' splice site (A3SS).
RESULTS: Interestingly, by applying self-organizing map (SOM) clustering, we unveiled two clusters mainly comprised of blood cancer cell types with a strong correlation between H3K79me2 and SE. Remarkably, the expression of transcripts associated with SE was not significantly different from that of those not associated with SE, indicating the involvement of H3K79me2 in splicing has little impact on full mRNA transcription. We further showed that the deletion of DOT1L1, the sole H3K79 methyltransferase, impeded leukemia cell proliferation as well as switched exon skipping to the inclusion isoform in two MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia cell lines. Our data demonstrate H3K79me2 was involved in mediating SE processing, which might in turn influence transformation and disease progression in leukemias.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our work for the first time reveals that H3K79me2 plays functional and regulatory roles through a co-transcriptional splicing mechanism.",Genome Med,2018,"['Li T', 'Liu Q', 'Garza N', 'Kornblau S', 'Jin VX']"
29664398,The nucleosomal acidic patch relieves auto-inhibition by the ISWI remodeler SNF2h.,"ISWI family chromatin remodeling motors use sophisticated autoinhibition mechanisms to control nucleosome sliding. Yet how the different autoinhibitory domains are regulated is not well understood. Here we show that an acidic patch formed by histones H2A and H2B of the nucleosome relieves the autoinhibition imposed by the AutoN and the NegC regions of the human ISWI remodeler SNF2h. Further, by single molecule FRET we show that the acidic patch helps control the distance travelled per translocation event. We propose a model in which the acidic patch activates SNF2h by providing a landing pad for the NegC and AutoN auto-inhibitory domains. Interestingly, the INO80 complex is also strongly dependent on the acidic patch for nucleosome sliding, indicating that this substrate feature can regulate remodeling enzymes with substantially different mechanisms. We therefore hypothesize that regulating access to the acidic patch of the nucleosome plays a key role in coordinating the activities of different remodelers in the cell.",Elife,2018,"['Gamarra N', 'Johnson SL', 'Trnka MJ', 'Burlingame AL', 'Narlikar GJ']"
29656668,"Effect of smoking on gene expression profile - overall mechanism, impact on respiratory system function, and reference to electronic cigarettes.","Cigarette smoke has a crucial impact on transcriptome alteration by its effect on chromatin remodeling and DNA methylation status. The first mechanism is associated with the histone acetylation/deacetylation balance damage as a result of increased activity of NFĸB and lipid peroxidation products, which lead to an increased activity of HATs and DNMTs and reduced HDACs. The second mechanism is connected with direct damaging of DNA by smoke components, activation of downstream repair mechanism and recruitment of DNMTs into the breakage site, 'nicotine effect' and carbon monoxide (CO) activity on gene transcription and DNA methylation reduction. Cigarette smoking activates oxidative and inflammatory response and leads to uncontrolled structural changes in airways and alters gene expression. Such changes have a characteristic similar to that for COPD patients. Therefore, smoking is determined as a key risk factor for chronic respiratory disease development. Furthermore, electronic cigarettes, an alternative of tobacco cigarettes, also affect gene expression profile, which suggests some similarities in action mechanisms for both conventional and electronic cigarettes. However, there is only a limited number of trials discussing this issue and future investigations are needed.",Toxicol. Mech. Methods,2018,"['Kopa PN', 'Pawliczak R']"
29648537,The conformation of the histone H3 tail inhibits association of the BPTF PHD finger with the nucleosome.,"Histone tails harbor a plethora of post-translational modifications that direct the function of chromatin regulators, which recognize them through effector domains. Effector domain/histone interactions have been broadly studied, but largely using peptide fragments of histone tails. Here, we extend these studies into the nucleosome context and find that the conformation adopted by the histone H3 tails is inhibitory to BPTF PHD finger binding. Using NMR spectroscopy and MD simulations, we show that the H3 tails interact robustly but dynamically with nucleosomal DNA, substantially reducing PHD finger association. Altering the electrostatics of the H3 tail via modification or mutation increases accessibility to the PHD finger, indicating that PTM crosstalk can regulate effector domain binding by altering nucleosome conformation. Together, our results demonstrate that the nucleosome context has a dramatic impact on signaling events at the histone tails, and highlights the importance of studying histone binding in the context of the nucleosome.",Elife,2018,"['Morrison EA', 'Bowerman S', 'Sylvers KL', 'Wereszczynski J', 'Musselman CA']"

Although H2BK120ub triggers several critical downstream histone modification pathways and changes in chromatin structure, less is known about the regulation of the ubiquitylation reaction itself, in particular with respect to the modification status of the chromatin substrate. Here we employ an unbiased library screening approach to profile the impact of pre-existing chromatin modifications on de novo ubiquitylation of H2BK120 by the cognate human E2:E3 ligase pair, UBE2A:RNF20/40. Deposition of H2BK120ub is found to be highly sensitive to PTMs on the N-terminal tail of histone H2A, a crosstalk that extends to the common histone variant H2A.Z. Based on a series of biochemical and cell-based studies, we propose that this crosstalk contributes to the spatial organization of H2BK120ub on gene bodies, and is thus important for transcriptional regulation.",Nat Commun,2018,"['Wojcik F', 'Dann GP', 'Beh LY', 'Debelouchina GT', 'Hofmann R', 'Muir TW']"

PREDICTD leverages an elegant model called ""tensor decomposition"" to impute many experiments simultaneously.

Nucleosomes are not randomly located on the DNA but positioned with respect to the DNA sequence, suggesting models in which critical binding sites are either exposed in the linker, resulting in activation, or buried inside a nucleosome, resulting in repression. The mechanisms determining nucleosome positioning are therefore of paramount importance for understanding gene regulation and other events that occur in chromatin, such as transcription, replication, and repair. Here, we review our current understanding of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning: DNA sequence, nonhistone DNA-binding proteins, chromatin-remodeling enzymes, and transcription.

29610279,H3K36me3-mediated mismatch repair preferentially protects actively transcribed genes from mutation.,"Histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 36 (H3K36me3) is an important histone mark involved in both transcription elongation and DNA mismatch repair (MMR). It is known that H3K36me3 recruits the mismatch-recognition protein MutSα to replicating chromatin via its physical interaction with MutSα's PWWP domain, but the exact role of H3K36me3 in transcription is undefined. Using ChIP combined with whole-genome DNA sequencing analysis, we demonstrate here that H3K36me3, together with MutSα, is involved in protecting against mutation, preferentially in actively transcribed genomic regions. We found that H3K36me3 and MutSα are much more co-enriched in exons and actively transcribed regions than in introns and nontranscribed regions. The H3K36me3-MutSα co-enrichment correlated with a much lower mutation frequency in exons and actively transcribed regions than in introns and nontranscribed regions. Correspondingly, depleting H3K36me3 or disrupting the H3K36me3-MutSα interaction elevated the spontaneous mutation frequency in actively transcribed genes, but it had little influence on the mutation frequency in nontranscribed or transcriptionally inactive regions.

However, little is known about how the catalytic activity of PRC2 is regulated to demarcate H3K27me2 and H3K27me3 domains across the genome. To address this, we mapped the endogenous interactomes of Ezh2 and Suz12 in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and we combined this with a functional screen for H3K27 methylation marks. We found that Nsd1-mediated H3K36me2 co-locates with H3K27me2, and its loss leads to genome-wide expansion of H3K27me3. These increases in H3K27me3 occurred at PRC2/PRC1 target genes and as de novo accumulation within what were previously broad H3K27me2 domains.

With an emphasis on changes in the HOXA10 gene expression of the endometrium of women with endometriosis, the aim of this study was to investigate HOXA10 gene expression and its correlation with the epigenetic characteristics of the specific promoter region of the gene in the eutopic and ectopic endometrium of women with endometriosis. Thirty-six patients and 21 healthy fertile women were recruited as participants of this study. In this study group, chromatin immunoprecipitation and real-time polymerase chain reaction technique were performed to quantify the epigenetic profile of HOXA10, parallel to its expression. During the secretory phase in eutopic tissues, reduction in HOXA10 gene expression was identified along with lower acetylation and higher methylation of H3K9 as well as higher incorporation of MeCP2 on the HOXA10 gene promoter. In contrast with control group, studies of ectopic endometriotic lesions in the secretory phase demonstrate a correlation between induction of HOXA10 gene and higher levels of H3K9ac, H3K27me3, and H3K4me3 in the promoter region of the HOXA10 gene. Further distinctions from the control group were revealed in the proliferative phase of the ectopic endometrium, where upregulation of HOXA10 coincided with lower incorporation of MeCP2 and higher levels of H3K4me3 in the promoter region. Since it is well known that aberrant expression of HOXA10 is involved in pathogenesis of the endometrium, our data emphasized the epigenetic role of this gene aberration related to clinical pathophysiology of endometriosis.",Reprod Sci,2019,"['Samadieh Y', 'Favaedi R', 'Ramezanali F', 'Afsharian P', 'Aflatoonian R', 'Shahhoseini M']"
29590617,Regulation of Cellular Senescence by Polycomb Chromatin Modifiers through Distinct DNA Damage- and Histone Methylation-Dependent Pathways.,"Polycomb group (PcG) factors maintain facultative heterochromatin and mediate many important developmental and differentiation processes. EZH2, a PcG histone H3 lysine-27 methyltransferase, is repressed in senescent cells. We show here that downregulation of EZH2 promotes senescence through two distinct mechanisms. First, depletion of EZH2 in proliferating cells rapidly initiates a DNA damage response prior to a reduction in the levels of H3K27me3 marks. Second, the eventual loss of H3K27me3 induces p16 (CDKN2A) gene expression independent of DNA damage and potently activates genes of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The progressive depletion of H3K27me3 marks can be viewed as a molecular ""timer"" to provide a window during which cells can repair DNA damage.

Most of these enzymes are essential for cell growth and survival due to their pleiotropic roles and studying their impact in vivo on organ development or tissue physiopathology is challenging. In this chapter, we describe a chemically-mediated method to induce colorectal carcinogenesis that we have used to identify in vivo the role of two chromatin modifying enzymes belonging to the same multimolecular complex, the histone acetyltransferase Tip60 and the histone variant-incorporating ATPase p400.",Methods Mol.

29576612,Protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation regulates STAT3 activation and oncogenic EZH2 activity.,"Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) member enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) trimethylates histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), alters chromatin structure and contributes to epigenetic regulation of gene expression in normal and disease processes. Phosphorylation of EZH2 augmented EZH2 oncogenic activity in cancer but observations have been limited to threonine 350 (T350) and serine 21 (S21) residues by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and protein kinase B, respectively. In addition, phosphorylation of the evolutionarily conserved T372 motif of EZH2 by p38 resulted in EZH2 interaction with Ying Yang 1 and promoted muscle stem cell differentiation. In the present study, we used epithelial ovarian cancer (OC) cells as a model to demonstrate that phosphorylation of EZH2 at T372 by protein kinase A (PKA) induced a dominant-negative EZH2 phenotype, inhibited OC cell proliferation and migration in vitro and decreased ovarian xenograft tumor growth in vivo. Phosphorylation of T372 by PKA enhanced the interaction between EZH2 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and STAT3 binding to pT372-EZH2 reduced cellular levels of pSTAT3 and downregulated interleukin 6 receptor expression in OC. Furthermore, PKA-mediated pT372-EZH2 decreased ATP levels and altered mitochondrial gene expression, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced OC cell growth. These findings demonstrate that PKA-mediated T372 phosphorylation reduces oncogenic EZH2 activity and reveal a novel role for pT372 in regulating EZH2 in OC and possibly other cancers.",Oncogene,2018,"['Özeş AR', 'Pulliam N', 'Ertosun MG', 'Yılmaz Ö', 'Tang J', 'Çopuroğlu E', 'Matei D', 'Özeş ON', 'Nephew KP']"
29576542,Histone variant H3.3 and its functions in reprogramming.,"Histones are a class of evolutionarily conserved nuclear proteins. Histone octamer wrapped by DNA sequence forms the nucleosome, the basic building blocks of eukaryotic chromatin. The nucleosomes keep the DNA in a condensed state, maintain the integrity of the genome, and ensure proper DNA replication, transcription, recombination and repair. Nucleosomes can regulate the biological processes of the cell through a number of distinct post-translational modifications (PTMs) and turnovers of histone variants. Although the histone H3 variant H3.3 differs from the canonical histone H3 by only a few amino acids, it could be incorporated into distinct chromatin regions by specific chaperones and exert diverse functions on the chromatin. Importantly, H3.3 is also an essential maternal factor, and plays a key role in cellular reprogramming during fertilization and somatic cell nuclear transfer. In this review, we summarize the structural properties and enrichment pattern of H3.3, and explore the specific chaperones involved in the H3.3-mediated cellular reprogramming. We hope to provide some insights on new means to improve the efficiency of somatic cell reprogramming and lay the foundation for its potential applications.",Yi Chuan,2018,"['Huang XW', 'Cheng XR', 'Wang N', 'Zhang YW', 'Liao C', 'Jin LH', 'Lei L']"

In higher eukaryotes, the identity of active centromeres is marked by the presence of CENP-A (centromeric protein-A), a histone H3 variant. CENP-A forms a centromere-specific nucleosome that acts as a foundation for centromere assembly and function. The posttranslational modification (PTM) of histone proteins is a major mechanism regulating the function of chromatin. While a few CENP-A site-specific modifications are shared with histone H3, the majority are specific to CENP-A-containing nucleosomes, indicating that modification of these residues contribute to centromere-specific function. CENP-A undergoes posttranslational modifications including phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, and ubiquitylation. Work from many laboratories have uncovered the importance of these CENP-A modifications in its deposition at centromeres, protein stability, and recruitment of the CCAN (constitutive centromere-associated network). Here, we discuss the PTMs of CENP-A and their biological relevance.",Chromosoma,2018,"['Srivastava S', 'Foltz DR']"

Herein, we demonstrated that treatment with luteolin resulted in a significant decrease in the viability of human leukemia cells.

Eukaryotic cells use an elegant ""epigenetic"" system to achieve this functionality. ""Epigenetics"" is referred to as heritable information beyond the DNA sequence, including histone and DNA modifications, ncRNAs and other chromatin-related components. Here, we review the mechanisms of the epigenetic inheritance of a repressive chromatin state, with an emphasis on recent progress in the field. We emphasize that (i) epigenetic information is inherited in a relatively stable but imprecise fashion; (ii) multiple cis and trans factors are involved in the maintenance of epigenetic information during mitosis; and (iii) the maintenance of a repressive epigenetic state requires both recruitment and self-reinforcement mechanisms. These mechanisms crosstalk with each other and form interconnected feedback loops to shape a stable epigenetic system while maintaining certain degrees of flexibility.",Sci China Life Sci,2018,"['Wang C', 'Zhu B', 'Xiong J']"

However, information on the regulatory mechanisms for alternative splicing is lacking, because splicing occurs over a short period via the transient interactions of proteins within functional complexes of the spliceosome. Here, we investigated in detail the molecular mechanisms connecting alternative splicing with epigenetic mechanisms. We identified interactions between histone proteins and splicing factors such as Rbfox2, Rbfox3, and splicing factor proline and glutamine rich protein (SFPQ) by in vivo crosslinking and immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, we confirmed that splicing factors were bound to specific modified residues of histone proteins. Additionally, changes in histone methylation due to histone methyltransferase inhibitor treatment notably affected alternative splicing in selected genes. Therefore, we suggested that there may be crosstalk mechanisms connecting histone modifications and RNA-binding proteins that increase the local concentration of RNA-binding proteins in alternative exon loci of nucleosomes by binding specific modified histone proteins, leading to alternative splicing. This crosstalk mechanism may play a major role in epigenetic processes such as histone modification and the regulation of alternative splicing.",Biochem. Biophys. Res.

29540829,LMTK3 confers chemo-resistance in breast cancer.,"Lemur tyrosine kinase 3 (LMTK3) is an oncogenic kinase that is involved in different types of cancer (breast, lung, gastric, colorectal) and biological processes including proliferation, invasion, migration, chromatin remodeling as well as innate and acquired endocrine resistance. However, the role of LMTK3 in response to cytotoxic chemotherapy has not been investigated thus far. Using both 2D and 3D tissue culture models, we found that overexpression of LMTK3 decreased the sensitivity of breast cancer cell lines to cytotoxic (doxorubicin) treatment. In a mouse model we showed that ectopic overexpression of LMTK3 decreases the efficacy of doxorubicin in reducing tumor growth. Interestingly, breast cancer cells overexpressing LMTK3 delayed the generation of double strand breaks (DSBs) after exposure to doxorubicin, as measured by the formation of γH2AX foci. This effect was at least partly mediated by decreased activity of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM) as indicated by its reduced phosphorylation levels. In addition, our RNA-seq analyses showed that doxorubicin differentially regulated the expression of over 700 genes depending on LMTK3 protein expression levels. Furthermore, these genes were found to promote DNA repair, cell viability and tumorigenesis processes / pathways in LMTK3-overexpressing MCF7 cells. In human cancers, immunohistochemistry staining of LMTK3 in pre- and post-chemotherapy breast tumor pairs from four separate clinical cohorts revealed a significant increase of LMTK3 following both doxorubicin and docetaxel based chemotherapy. In aggregate, our findings show for the first time a contribution of LMTK3 in cytotoxic drug resistance in breast cancer.",Oncogene,2018,"['Stebbing J', 'Shah K', 'Lit LC', 'Gagliano T', 'Ditsiou A', 'Wang T', 'Wendler F', 'Simon T', 'Szabó KS', ""O'Hanlon T"", 'Dean M', 'Roslani AC', 'Cheah SH', 'Lee SC', 'Giamas G']"

To date, three methods to change chromatin structure and regulate gene expression have been well-documented: histone modification, histone exchange, and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling. Recently, a growing body of literature has suggested that histone tail cleavage is related to various cellular processes including stem cell differentiation, osteoclast differentiation, granulocyte differentiation, mammary gland differentiation, viral infection, aging, and yeast sporulation. Although the underlying mechanisms suggesting how histone cleavage affects gene expression in view of chromatin structure are only beginning to be understood, it is clear that this process is a novel transcriptional epigenetic mechanism involving chromatin dynamics. In this review, we describe the functional properties of the known histone tail cleavage with its proteolytic enzymes, discuss how histone cleavage impacts gene expression, and present future directions for this area of study.

29535729,Epigenomic Modifications Mediating Antibody Maturation.,"Epigenetic modifications, such as histone modifications, DNA methylation status, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNA), all contribute to antibody maturation during somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class-switch recombination (CSR). Histone modifications alter the chromatin landscape and, together with DNA primary and tertiary structures, they help recruit Activation-Induced Cytidine Deaminase (AID) to the immunoglobulin (Ig) locus. AID is a potent DNA mutator, which catalyzes cytosine-to-uracil deamination on single-stranded DNA to create U:G mismatches. It has been shown that alternate chromatin modifications, in concert with ncRNAs and potentially DNA methylation, regulate AID recruitment and stabilize DNA repair factors. We, hereby, assess the combination of these distinct modifications and discuss how they contribute to initiating differential DNA repair pathways at the Ig locus, which ultimately leads to enhanced antibody-antigen binding affinity (SHM) or antibody isotype switching (CSR). We will also highlight how misregulation of epigenomic regulation during DNA repair can compromise antibody development and lead to a number of immunological syndromes and cancer.",Front Immunol,2018,"['Sheppard EC', 'Morrish RB', 'Dillon MJ', 'Leyland R', 'Chahwan R']"
29531310,NCoR/SMRT co-repressors cooperate with c-MYC to create an epigenetic barrier to somatic cell reprogramming.,"Somatic cell reprogramming by exogenous factors requires cooperation with transcriptional co-activators and co-repressors to effectively remodel the epigenetic environment. How this interplay is regulated remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that NCoR/SMRT co-repressors bind to pluripotency loci to create a barrier to reprogramming with the four Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC), and consequently, suppressing NCoR/SMRT significantly enhances reprogramming efficiency and kinetics. The core epigenetic subunit of the NCoR/SMRT complex, histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), contributes to the effects of NCoR/SMRT by inducing histone deacetylation at pluripotency loci. Among the Yamanaka factors, recruitment of NCoR/SMRT-HDAC3 to genomic loci is mostly facilitated by c-MYC. Hence, we describe how c-MYC is beneficial for the early phase of reprogramming but deleterious later. Overall, we uncover a role for NCoR/SMRT co-repressors in reprogramming and propose a dual function for c-MYC in this process.",Nat.

29529298,Human CHD1 is required for early DNA-damage signaling and is uniquely regulated by its N terminus.,"CHD1 is a conserved chromatin remodeling enzyme required for development and linked to prostate cancer in adults, yet its role in human cells is poorly understood. Here, we show that targeted disruption of the CHD1 gene in human cells leads to a defect in early double-strand break (DSB) repair via homologous recombination (HR), resulting in hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation as well as PARP and PTEN inhibition. CHD1 knockout cells show reduced H2AX phosphorylation (γH2AX) and foci formation as well as impairments in CtIP recruitment to the damaged sites. Chromatin immunoprecipitation following a single DSB shows that the reduced levels of γH2AX accumulation at DSBs in CHD1-KO cells are due to both a global reduction in H2AX incorporation and poor retention of H2AX at the DSBs. We also identified a unique N-terminal region of CHD1 that inhibits the DNA binding, ATPase, and chromatin assembly and remodeling activities of CHD1. CHD1 lacking the N terminus was more active in rescuing the defects in γH2AX formation and CtIP recruitment in CHD1-KO cells than full-length CHD1, suggesting the N terminus is a negative regulator in cells. Our data point to a role for CHD1 in the DSB repair process and identify a novel regulatory region of the protein.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2018,"['Zhou J', 'Li J', 'Serafim RB', 'Ketchum S', 'Ferreira CG', 'Liu JC', 'Coe KA', 'Price BD', 'Yusufzai T']"

Numerous interactions between specific reader protein domains and histone PTMs and their regulatory outcomes have been reported, but little is known about how reader proteins may in turn be modulated by these interactions. Tripartite motif-containing protein 24 (TRIM24) is a histone reader aberrantly expressed in multiple cancers. Here, our investigation revealed functional cross-talk between histone acetylation and TRIM24 SUMOylation. Binding of TRIM24 to chromatin via its tandem PHD-bromodomain, which recognizes unmethylated lysine 4 and acetylated lysine 23 of histone H3 (H3K4me0/K23ac), led to TRIM24 SUMOylation at lysine residues 723 and 741. Inactivation of the bromodomain, either by mutation or with a small-molecule inhibitor, IACS-9571, abolished TRIM24 SUMOylation. Conversely, inhibition of histone deacetylation markedly increased TRIM24's interaction with chromatin and its SUMOylation. Of note, gene expression profiling of MCF7 cells expressing WT ",J. Biol.

Although both clinical groups present similar phenotypes, the existence of potential common mechanisms of pathogenesis remain obscure. Here we show that mutations affecting TGF-β signaling and VSMC cytoskeleton both lead to the formation of a ternary complex comprising the histone deacetylase HDAC9, the chromatin-remodeling enzyme BRG1, and the long noncoding RNA MALAT1. The HDAC9-MALAT1-BRG1 complex binds chromatin and represses contractile protein gene expression in association with gain of histone H3-lysine 27 trimethylation modifications. Disruption of Malat1 or Hdac9 restores contractile protein expression, improves aortic mural architecture, and inhibits experimental aneurysm growth.

29515022,Inhibition of the methyltranferase EZH2 improves aortic performance in experimental thoracic aortic aneurysm.,"Loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding contractile proteins have been observed in thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA). To gain insight into the contribution of contractile protein deficiency in the pathogenesis of TAA, we examined human aneurysm samples. We found multiple contractile gene products deficient in TAA samples, and in particular, expression of SM22α was inversely correlated with aneurysm size. SM22α-deficient mice demonstrated pregnancy-induced aortic dissection, and SM22α deficiency worsened aortic aneurysm in Fbn1C1039G/+ (Marfan) mice, validating this gene product as a TAA effector. We found that repression of SM22α was enforced by increased activity of the methyltransferase EZH2. TGF-β effectors such as SMAD3 were excluded from binding SM22α-encoding chromatin (TAGLN) in TAA samples, while treatment with the EZH2 inhibitor GSK343 improved cytoskeletal architecture and restored SM22α expression. Finally, inhibition of EZH2 improved aortic performance in Fbn1C1039G/+ mice, in association with restoration of contractile protein expression (including SM22α). Together, these data inform our understanding of contractile protein deficiency in TAA and support the pursuit of chromatin modifying factors as therapeutic targets in aortic disease.",JCI Insight,2018,"['Lino Cardenas CL', 'Kessinger CW', 'MacDonald C', 'Jassar AS', 'Isselbacher EM', 'Jaffer FA', 'Lindsay ME']"
29512899,Integrating Proteomics and Targeted Metabolomics to Understand Global Changes in Histone Modifications.,"The chromatin fiber is the control panel of eukaryotic cells. Chromatin is mostly composed of DNA, which contains the genetic instruction for cell phenotype, and histone proteins, which provide the scaffold for chromatin folding and part of the epigenetic inheritance. Histone writers/erasers ""flag"" chromatin regions by catalyzing/removing covalent histone post-translational modifications (PTMs). Histone PTMs chemically contribute to chromatin relaxation or compaction and recruit histone readers to modulate DNA readout. The precursors of protein PTMs are mostly small metabolites. For instance, acetyl-CoA is used for acetylation, ATP for phosphorylation, and S-adenosylmethionine for methylation. Interestingly, PTMs such as acetylation can occur at neutral pH also without their respective enzyme when the precursor is sufficiently concentrated. Therefore, it is essential to differentially quantify the contribution of histone writers/erasers versus the effect of local concentration of metabolites to understand the primary regulation of histone PTM abundance. Aberrant phenotypes such as cancer cells have misregulated metabolism and thus the composition and the modulation of chromatin is not only driven by enzymatic tuning. In this review, the latest advances in mass spectrometry (MS) to analyze histone PTMs and the most adopted quantification methods for related metabolites, both necessary to understand PTM relative changes, are discussed.",Proteomics,2018,"['Simithy J', 'Sidoli S', 'Garcia BA']"
29511340,LncRNA CASC9 promotes esophageal squamous cell carcinoma metastasis through upregulating LAMC2 expression by interacting with the CREB-binding protein.,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the main subtype of esophageal cancer. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are thought to play a critical role in cancer development. Recently, lncRNA CASC9 was shown to be dysregulated in many cancer types, but the mechanisms whereby this occurs remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that CASC9 was significantly upregulated in ESCC tissues, with further analysis revealing that elevated CASC9 expression was associated with ESCC prognosis and metastasis. Furthermore, we found that CASC9 knockdown significantly repressed ESCC migration and invasion in vitro and metastasis in nude mice in vivo. A microarray analysis and mechanical experiments indicated that CASC9 preferentially affected gene expression linked to ECM-integrin interactions, including LAMC2, an upstream inducer of the integrin pathway. We demonstrated that LAMC2 was consistently upregulated in ESCC and promoted ESCC metastasis. LAMC2 overexpression partially compromised the decrease of cell migration and invasion capacity in CASC9 knockdowns. In addition, we found that both CASC9 and LAMC2 depletion reduced the phosphorylation of FAK, PI3K, and Akt, which are downstream effectors of the integrin pathway. Moreover, the reduction in phosphorylation caused by CASC9 depletion was rescued by LAMC2 overexpression, further confirming that CASC9 exerts a pro-metastatic role through LAMC2. Mechanistically, RNA pull-down and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay indicated that CASC9 could bind with the transcriptional coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) in the nucleus. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay additionally illustrated that CASC9 increased the enrichment of CBP and H3K27 acetylation in the LAMC2 promoter, thereby upregulating LAMC2 expression. In conclusion, we demonstrate that CASC9 upregulates LAMC2 expression by binding with CBP and modifying histone acetylation. Our research reveals the prognostic and pro-metastatic roles for CASC9 in ESCC, suggesting that CASC9 could serve as a biomarker for prognosis and a target for metastasis treatment.",Cell Death Differ.,2018,"['Liang Y', 'Chen X', 'Wu Y', 'Li J', 'Zhang S', 'Wang K', 'Guan X', 'Yang K', 'Bai Y']"
29507419,EZH2 regulates neuroblastoma cell differentiation via NTRK1 promoter epigenetic modifications.,"The polycomb repressor complex 2 molecule EZH2 is now known to play a role in essential cellular processes, namely, cell fate decisions, cell cycle regulation, senescence, cell differentiation, and cancer development/progression. EZH2 inhibitors have recently been developed; however, their effectiveness and underlying molecular mechanisms in many malignancies have not yet been elucidated in detail. Although the functional role of EZH2 in tumorigenesis in neuroblastoma (NB) has been investigated, mutations of EZH2 have not been reported. A Kaplan-Meier analysis on the event free survival and overall survival of NB patients indicated that the high expression of EZH2 correlated with an unfavorable prognosis. In order to elucidate the functional roles of EZH2 in NB tumorigenesis and its aggressiveness, we knocked down EZH2 in NB cell lines using lentivirus systems. The knockdown of EZH2 significantly induced NB cell differentiation, e.g., neurite extension, and the neuronal differentiation markers, NF68 and GAP43. EZH2 inhibitors also induced NB cell differentiation. We performed a comprehensive transcriptome analysis using Human Gene Expression Microarrays and found that NTRK1 (TrkA) is one of the EZH2-related suppression targets. The depletion of NTRK1 canceled EZH2 knockdown-induced NB cell differentiation. Our integrative methylome, transcriptome, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using NB cell lines and clinical samples clarified that the NTRK1 P1 and P2 promoter regions were regulated differently by DNA methylation and EZH2-related histone modifications. The NTRK1 transcript variants 1/2, which were regulated by EZH2-related H3K27me3 modifications at the P1 promoter region, were strongly expressed in favorable, but not unfavorable NB. The depletion and inhibition of EZH2 successfully induced NTRK1 transcripts and functional proteins. Collectively, these results indicate that EZH2 plays important roles in preventing the differentiation of NB cells and also that EZH2-related NTRK1 transcriptional regulation may be the key pathway for NB cell differentiation.",Oncogene,2018,"['Li Z', 'Takenobu H', 'Setyawati AN', 'Akita N', 'Haruta M', 'Satoh S', 'Shinno Y', 'Chikaraishi K', 'Mukae K', 'Akter J', 'Sugino RP', 'Nakazawa A', 'Nakagawara A', 'Aburatani H', 'Ohira M', 'Kamijo T']"

29506131,Comparative biochemical analysis of UHRF proteins reveals molecular mechanisms that uncouple UHRF2 from DNA methylation maintenance.,"UHRF1 is a histone- and DNA-binding E3 ubiquitin ligase that functions with DNMT1 to maintain mammalian DNA methylation. UHRF1 facilitates DNMT1 recruitment to replicating chromatin through a coordinated mechanism involving histone and DNA recognition and histone ubiquitination. UHRF2 shares structural homology with UHRF1, but surprisingly lacks functional redundancy to facilitate DNA methylation maintenance. Molecular mechanisms uncoupling UHRF2 from DNA methylation maintenance are poorly defined. Through comprehensive and comparative biochemical analysis of recombinant human UHRF1 and UHRF2 reader and writer activities, we reveal conserved modes of histone PTM recognition but divergent DNA binding properties. While UHRF1 and UHRF2 diverge in their affinities toward hemi-methylated DNA, we surprisingly show that both hemi-methylated and hemi-hydroxymethylated DNA oligonucleotides stimulate UHRF2 ubiquitin ligase activity toward histone H3 peptide substrates. This is the first example of an E3 ligase allosterically regulated by DNA hydroxymethylation. However, UHRF2 is not a productive histone E3 ligase toward purified mononucleosomes, suggesting UHRF2 has an intra-domain architecture distinct from UHRF1 that is conformationally constrained when bound to chromatin. Collectively, our studies reveal that uncoupling of UHRF2 from the DNA methylation maintenance program is linked to differences in the molecular readout of chromatin signatures that connect UHRF1 to ubiquitination of histone H3.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2018,"['Vaughan RM', 'Dickson BM', 'Cornett EM', 'Harrison JS', 'Kuhlman B', 'Rothbart SB']"
29504244,Distinct chromatin signatures of DNA hypomethylation in aging and cancer.,"Cancer is an aging-associated disease, but the underlying molecular links between these processes are still largely unknown. Gene promoters that become hypermethylated in aging and cancer share a common chromatin signature in ES cells. In addition, there is also global DNA hypomethylation in both processes. However, the similarity of the regions where this loss of DNA methylation occurs is currently not well characterized, and it is unknown if such regions also share a common chromatin signature in aging and cancer. To address this issue, we analyzed TCGA DNA methylation data from a total of 2,311 samples, including control and cancer cases from patients with breast, kidney, thyroid, skin, brain, and lung tumors and healthy blood, and integrated the results with histone, chromatin state, and transcription factor binding site data from the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE projects. We identified 98,857 CpG sites differentially methylated in aging and 286,746 in cancer. Hyper- and hypomethylated changes in both processes each had a similar genomic distribution across tissues and displayed tissue-independent alterations. The identified hypermethylated regions in aging and cancer shared a similar bivalent chromatin signature. In contrast, hypomethylated DNA sequences occurred in very different chromatin contexts. DNA hypomethylated sequences were enriched at genomic regions marked with the activating histone posttranslational modification H3K4me1 in aging, while in cancer, loss of DNA methylation was primarily associated with the repressive H3K9me3 mark.

29499155,SETD7 Drives Cardiac Lineage Commitment through Stage-Specific Transcriptional Activation.,"Cardiac development requires coordinated and large-scale rearrangements of the epigenome. The roles and precise mechanisms through which specific epigenetic modifying enzymes control cardiac lineage specification, however, remain unclear. Here we show that the H3K4 methyltransferase SETD7 controls cardiac differentiation by reading H3K36 marks independently of its enzymatic activity. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), we found that SETD7 targets distinct sets of genes to drive their stage-specific expression during cardiomyocyte differentiation. SETD7 associates with different co-factors at these stages, including SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling factors during mesodermal formation and the transcription factor NKX2.5 in cardiac progenitors to drive their differentiation.

29499098,The impact of histones linked to sperm chromatin on embryo development and ART outcome.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the proportion of sperm chromatin linked to remaining histone and assisted reproductive technology (ART) outcome. A prospective cohort study was performed on couples undergoing ART process at the Department of Reproduction Medicine (HFME, Bron, France). The histone-to-protamine ratio (HPR) was measured using the method described by Wykes & Krawetz (2003) J Biol Chem 278, 29471. The correlations with sperm DFI, blastocyst formation, pregnancy rate, and delivery rate were investigated. A total of 291 ART cycles were included (42 c-IVF and 249 ICSI procedures): 3870 oocytes were punctured and 2211 embryos were obtained, among which 507 were transferred and 336 frozen. The mean HPR was 18.9%. A significant negative correlation was found between HPR and DFI (r = -0.12, p < 0.05). Regarding the type of ART procedure (c-IVF or ICSI), the same kind of relationship between HPR and ART parameters was observed. Regardless of the type of ART procedure used, when the HPR was within the range [6%; 26%], the blastocyst formation rate was higher: 87.8% vs. 71.2% (HPR<6%; p < 0.01) and 74.6% (HPR >26%; p < 0.01). The highest delivery rate (DR; 24.5%) was obtained for HPR within the range [6%; 26%]; DR was 21.9% for HPR<6% and 18.3% for HPR>26%; however, the differences were not statistically significant. The procedure described in this study seems to be a reliable evaluation of the HPR. The HPR parameter seems to be correlated to embryonic development up to the blastocyst stage, but its involvement in clinical pregnancy/delivery could not be confirmed. HPR should be further investigated for confirming the relationship with blastocyst formation. After this, the next step will be to investigate the etiologies of HPR alterations for improving the sperm nucleus quality for increasing the chance of pregnancy.",Andrology,2018,"['Fournier C', 'Labrune E', 'Lornage J', 'Soignon G', ""Giscard d'Estaing S"", 'Guérin JF', 'Benchaib M']"
29495487,DOT1L and H3K79 Methylation in Transcription and Genomic Stability.,"The organization of eukaryotic genomes into chromatin provides challenges for the cell to accomplish basic cellular functions, such as transcription, DNA replication and repair of DNA damage. Accordingly, a range of proteins modify and/or read chromatin states to regulate access to chromosomal DNA. Yeast Dot1 and the mammalian homologue DOT1L are methyltransferases that can add up to three methyl groups to histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79). H3K79 methylation is implicated in several processes, including transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II, the DNA damage response and cell cycle checkpoint activation. DOT1L is also an important drug target for treatment of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged leukemia where aberrant transcriptional activation is promoted by DOT1L mislocalisation. This review summarizes what is currently known about the role of Dot1/DOT1L and H3K79 methylation in transcription and genomic stability.",Biomolecules,2018,"['Wood K', 'Tellier M', 'Murphy S']"
29491472,Integrative functional analysis of super enhancer SNPs for coronary artery disease.,"Clinical research in coronary artery disease (CAD) primarily focused on genetic variants located in protein-coding regions. Recently, mutations fall within non-coding regions have been suggested to be essential to the pathogenesis of human complex disease. Super enhancer is a densely spaced cluster of transcriptional enhancers located in non-coding regions, which is critical for regulating cell-type specific gene expression. However, the underlying mechanism of the super enhancer single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting the risk of CAD remains unclear. By integrating genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of CAD and cell/tissue-specific histone modification data set, we identified 366 potential CAD-associated super enhancer SNPs in 67 loci, including 94 SNPs that are involved in regulating chromatin interactive and/or affecting the transcription factors binding affinity. Interestingly, we found 7 novel functional loci (CBFA2T3, ZMIZ1, DIP2B, SCNN1D/ACAP3, TMEM105, CAMK2G, and MAPK1) that CAD-associated super enhancer SNPs were clustered into the same or neighboring super enhancers. Pathway analysis showed a significant enrichment in several well-known signaling and regulatory processes, e.g., cAMP signaling pathway and ErbB signaling pathway, which play a key role in CAD metabolism. Our results highlight the potential functional importance of CAD-associated super enhancer SNPs and provide the targets for further insights on the pathogenesis of CAD.",J. Hum.

29485113,ATR kinase regulates its attenuation via PPM1D phosphatase recruitment to chromatin during recovery from DNA replication stress signalling.,"In eukaryotes, in response to replication stress, DNA damage response kinase, ATR is activated, whose signalling abrogation leads to cell lethality due to aberrant fork remodelling and excessive origin firing. Here we report that inhibition of ATR kinase activity specifically during replication stress recovery results in persistent ATR signalling, evidenced by the presence of ATR-dependent phosphorylation marks (gamma H2AX, pChk1 and pRad17) and delayed cell cycle re-entry. Further, such disruption of ATR signalling attenuation leads to double-strand breaks, fork collapse and thereby 'replication catastrophe'. PPM1D phosphatase, a nucleolar localized protein, relocates to chromatin during replication stress and reverts back to nucleolus following stress recovery, under the control of ATR kinase action. Inhibition of ATR kinase activity, specifically during post replication stress, triggers dislodging of the chromatin-bound PPM1D from nucleus to cytoplasm followed by its degradation, thereby leading to persistence of activated ATR marks in the nuclei. Chemical inhibition of PPM1D activity or SiRNA mediated depletion of the protein during post replication stress recovery 'phenocopies' ATR kinase inhibition by failing to attenuate ATR signalling. Collectively, our observations suggest a novel role of ATR kinase in mediating its own signal attenuation via PPM1D recruitment to chromatin as an essential mechanism for restarting the stalled forks, cell-cycle re-entry and cellular recovery from replication stress.",J.

29483212,Inhibition of the Histone H3K27 Demethylase UTX Enhances Tumor Cell Radiosensitivity.,"The processes mediating the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) are critical determinants of radiosensitivity and provide a source of potential targets for tumor radiosensitization. Among the events required for efficient DSB repair are a variety of post-translational histone modifications, including methylation. Because trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3) has been associated with chromatin condensation, which can influence DSB repair, we determined the effects of radiation on H3K27me3 levels in tumor and normal cell lines. Irradiation of tumor cells resulted in a rapid loss of H3K27me3, which was prevented by the siRNA-mediated knockdown of the H3K27 demethylase UTX. Knockdown of UTX also enhanced the radiosensitivity of each tumor cell line. Treatment of tumor cells with the H3K27 demethylase inhibitor GSKJ4 immediately before irradiation prevented the radiation-induced decrease in H3K27me3 and enhanced radiosensitivity. As determined by neutral comet analysis and γH2AX expression, this GSKJ4 treatment protocol inhibited the repair of radiation-induced DSBs. Consistent with ",Mol.

29482435,H4K20me2: Orchestrating the recruitment of DNA repair factors in nucleotide excision repair.,The integrity of the genome is maintained by specific DNA repair pathways. The main pathway removing DNA lesions induced by exposure to UV light is nucleotide excision repair (NER). The DNA damage response at chromatin is accompanied by the recruitment of DNA repair factors to the lesion site and the deposition of specific histone marks. The function of these histone marks in NER stays for the most part elusive. We have recently reported that the methyltransferase MMSET catalyzes the dimethylation of histone H4 at lysine 20 (H4K20me2) at the lesion site. The deposition of H4K20me2 at DNA damage sites elicits the recruitment of the NER factor XPA providing evidence for an H4K20me2-dependent DNA repair factor recruitment mechanism during lesion recognition in the global-genomic branch of NER. Here we discuss how H4K20me2 might impact on the chromatin conformation and the DNA damage response.,Nucleus,2018,"['Chitale S', 'Richly H']"
29478809,PRDM9 Methyltransferase Activity Is Essential for Meiotic DNA Double-Strand Break Formation at Its Binding Sites.,"The programmed formation of hundreds of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is essential for proper meiosis and fertility. In mice and humans, the location of these breaks is determined by the meiosis-specific protein PRDM9, through the DNA-binding specificity of its zinc-finger domain. PRDM9 also has methyltransferase activity. Here, we show that this activity is required for H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 deposition and for DSB formation at PRDM9-binding sites. By analyzing mice that express two PRDM9 variants with distinct DNA-binding specificities, we show that each variant generates its own set of H3K4me3 marks independently from the other variant. Altogether, we reveal several basic principles of PRDM9-dependent DSB site determination, in which an excess of sites are designated through PRDM9 binding and subsequent histone methylation, from which a subset is selected for DSB formation.",Mol.

The purpose of this study was to identify any such modifications in diseased retinal tissues from a mouse model of rhodopsin mutation-associated autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP), Q344X, relative to age-matched wild-type (WT) controls.
Methods: We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) at poly(A) selected RNA to profile the transcriptional patterns in 3-week-old ADRP mouse model rhodopsin Q344X compared to WT controls. Differentially expressed genes were determined by DESeq2 using the Benjamini & Hochberg p value adjustment and an absolute log
Results: We observed significant differential expression in 2151 genes in the retina of Q344X mice compared to WT controls, including downregulation in the potassium channel gene,

29459768,Oncoprotein Tudor-SN is a key determinant providing survival advantage under DNA damaging stress.,"Herein, Tudor-SN was identified as a DNA damage response (DDR)-related protein that plays important roles in the early stage of DDR. X-ray or laser irradiation could evoke the accumulation of Tudor-SN to DNA damage sites in a poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation-dependent manner via interaction with PARP-1. Additionally, we illustrated that the SN domain of Tudor-SN mediated the association of these two proteins. The accumulated Tudor-SN further recruited SMARCA5 (ATP-dependent chromatin remodeller) and GCN5 (histone acetyltransferase) to DNA damage sites, resulting in chromatin relaxation, and consequently activating the ATM kinase and downstream DNA repair signalling pathways to promote cell survival. Consistently, the loss-of-function of Tudor-SN attenuated the enrichment of SMARCA5, GCN5 and acetylation of histone H3 (acH3) at DNA break sites and abolished chromatin relaxation; as a result, the cells exhibited DNA repair and cell survival deficiency. As Tudor-SN protein is highly expressed in different tumours, it is likely to be involved in the radioresistance of cancer treatment.",Cell Death Differ.,2018,"['Fu X', 'Zhang C', 'Meng H', 'Zhang K', 'Shi L', 'Cao C', 'Wang Y', 'Su C', 'Xin L', 'Ren Y', 'Zhang W', 'Sun X', 'Ge L', 'Silvennoinen O', 'Yao Z', 'Yang X', 'Yang J']"

RESULTS: To define alterations in epigenetic landscapes in breast cancers, we profiled the distributions of 8 key histone modifications by ChIP-Seq, as well as primary (GRO-seq) and steady state (RNA-Seq) transcriptomes, across 13 distinct cell lines that represent 5 molecular subtypes of breast cancer and immortalized human mammary epithelial cells.
DISCUSSION: Using combinatorial patterns of distinct histone modification signals, we defined subtype-specific chromatin signatures to nominate potential biomarkers. This approach identified AFAP1-AS1 as a triple negative breast cancer-specific gene associated with cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal-transition. In addition, our chromatin mapping data in basal TNBC cell lines are consistent with gene expression patterns in TCGA that indicate decreased activity of the androgen receptor pathway but increased activity of the vitamin D biosynthesis pathway.

29457784,HIV latency is reversed by ACSS2-driven histone crotonylation.,"Eradication of HIV-1 (HIV) is hindered by stable viral reservoirs. Viral latency is epigenetically regulated. While the effects of histone acetylation and methylation at the HIV long-terminal repeat (LTR) have been described, our knowledge of the proviral epigenetic landscape is incomplete. We report that a previously unrecognized epigenetic modification of the HIV LTR, histone crotonylation, is a regulator of HIV latency. Reactivation of latent HIV was achieved following the induction of histone crotonylation through increased expression of the crotonyl-CoA-producing enzyme acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2 (ACSS2). This reprogrammed the local chromatin at the HIV LTR through increased histone acetylation and reduced histone methylation. Pharmacologic inhibition or siRNA knockdown of ACSS2 diminished histone crotonylation-induced HIV replication and reactivation. ACSS2 induction was highly synergistic in combination with either a protein kinase C agonist (PEP005) or a histone deacetylase inhibitor (vorinostat) in reactivating latent HIV. In the SIV-infected nonhuman primate model of AIDS, the expression of ACSS2 was significantly induced in intestinal mucosa in vivo, which correlated with altered fatty acid metabolism. Our study links the HIV/SIV infection-induced fatty acid enzyme ACSS2 to HIV latency and identifies histone lysine crotonylation as a novel epigenetic regulator for HIV transcription that can be targeted for HIV eradication.",J.

Also, histones are harmful when they enter the intercellular space; their administration to animals results in systemic inflammatory and toxic responses. Autoantibodies having enzymatic activities (abzymes) are the specific feature of several autoimmune and viral diseases. Electrophoretically homogeneous IgGs containing no canonical proteases were purified from sera of HIV-infected patients by using several affinity chromatographies. In contrast to known canonical proteases, Abs from HIV-infected patients hydrolyzed exclusively only histones but no other control globular proteins. The H3 and H4 histone cleavage sites by antihistone IgGs were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry for the first time. Two clusters of H3 hydrolysis contain major (↕) and minor (*) cleavage sites: 18-K*Q*LA↕TK*A↕AR*KS↕A*P-30 and 34-G*VK*KPHR*YRPGTVA*L*R-50. H4 histone has only 1 cluster of cleavage sites containing additionally moderate (↓) cleavage sites: 15-A↕KR↕HR↕KVLR↓D*NIQ↓GIT*K-31. Sites of these histones cleavage correspond mainly to their known epitopes. It was surprising that most of the cleavage sites of histones are involved in the interaction with DNA of nucleosome core. Because histones act as damage-associated molecules, abzymes against H3 and H4 can play important role in pathogenesis of AIDs and probably other viral and immune diseases.",J. Mol.

APPROACH AND RESULTS: Observing that Cre/Lox-induced conditional mutations of endothelial Notch modulated inflammation in murine contact hypersensitivity, we found that IL (interleukin)-1β stimulation induced rapid recruitment of RELA (v-rel avian reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A) to genomic sites occupied by NOTCH1-RBPJ (recombination signal-binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region) and that NOTCH1 knockdown reduced histone H3K27 acetylation at a subset of NF-κB-directed inflammatory enhancers.

29432129,Identification of Two Distinct Classes of the Human INO80 Complex Genome-Wide.,"Chromatin remodeling and histone modifying enzymes play a critical role in shaping the regulatory output of a cell. Although much is known about these classes of proteins, identifying the mechanisms by which they coordinate gene expression programs remains an exciting topic of investigation. One factor that may contribute to the targeting and activity of chromatin regulators is local chromatin landscape. We leveraged genomic approaches and publically-available datasets to characterize the chromatin landscape at targets of the human INO80 chromatin remodeling complex (INO80-C). Our data revealed two classes of INO80-C targets with distinct chromatin signatures. The predominant INO80-C class was enriched for open chromatin, H3K27ac, and representative subunits from each of the three INO80-C modules (RUVBL1, RUVBL2, MCRS1, YY1). We named this class Canonical INO80. Notably, we identified an unexpected class of INO80-C targets that contained only the INO80 ATPase and harbored a repressive chromatin signature characterized by inaccessible chromatin, H3K27me3, and the methyltransferase EZH2. We named this class Non-Canonical INO80 (NC-INO80). Biochemical approaches indicated that INO80-C and the H3K27 acetyltransferase P300 physically interact, suggesting INO80-C and P300 may jointly coordinate chromatin accessibility at Canonical INO80 sites. No interaction was detected between INO80-C and EZH2, indicating INO80-C and EZH2 may engage in a separate form of regulatory crosstalk at NC-INO80 targets. Our data indicate that INO80-C is more compositionally heterogenous at its genomic targets than anticipated. Moreover, our data suggest there is an important link between INO80-C and histone modifying enzymes that may have consequences in developmental and pathological contexts.",G3 (Bethesda),2018,"['Runge JS', 'Raab JR', 'Magnuson T']"

29429572,Mutations in the BAF-Complex Subunit DPF2 Are Associated with Coffin-Siris Syndrome.,"Variants affecting the function of different subunits of the BAF chromatin-remodelling complex lead to various neurodevelopmental syndromes, including Coffin-Siris syndrome. Furthermore, variants in proteins containing PHD fingers, motifs recognizing specific histone tail modifications, have been associated with several neurological and developmental-delay disorders. Here, we report eight heterozygous de novo variants (one frameshift, two splice site, and five missense) in the gene encoding the BAF complex subunit double plant homeodomain finger 2 (DPF2). Affected individuals share common clinical features described in individuals with Coffin-Siris syndrome, including coarse facial features, global developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech impairment, and hypoplasia of fingernails and toenails. All variants occur within the highly conserved PHD1 and PHD2 motifs. Moreover, missense variants are situated close to zinc binding sites and are predicted to disrupt these sites. Pull-down assays of recombinant proteins and histone peptides revealed that a subset of the identified missense variants abolish or impaire DPF2 binding to unmodified and modified H3 histone tails. These results suggest an impairment of PHD finger structural integrity and cohesion and most likely an aberrant recognition of histone modifications. Furthermore, the overexpression of these variants in HEK293 and COS7 cell lines was associated with the formation of nuclear aggregates and the recruitment of both wild-type DPF2 and BRG1 to these aggregates. Expression analysis of truncating variants found in the affected individuals indicated that the aberrant transcripts escape nonsense-mediated decay.

We demonstrated that PcTF activates genes at methyl-histone-enriched loci in cancer-derived cell lines.

Nucleosolic P-TEFb activity is inhibited by its interaction with the ribonuclear protein complex built around the 7SK small nuclear RNA (7SK snRNP). MePCE is the RNA methyltransferase that methylates and stabilizes 7SK in the nucleosol. Here, we report that MePCE also binds chromatin through the histone H4 tail to serve as a P-TEFb activator at specific genes important for cellular identity. Notably, this histone binding abolishes MePCE's RNA methyltransferase activity toward 7SK, which explains why MePCE-bound P-TEFb on chromatin may not be associated with the full 7SK snRNP and is competent for RNAP II activation. Overall, our results suggest that crosstalk between the histone-binding and RNA methylation activities of MePCE regulates P-TEFb activation on chromatin in a 7SK- and Brd4-independent manner.",Cell Rep,2018,"['Shelton SB', 'Shah NM', 'Abell NS', 'Devanathan SK', 'Mercado M', 'Xhemalçe B']"

Many coactivator proteins possess intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity that catalyzes the acetylation of specific lysine residues in histone tails and loosens the histone-DNA interaction, thereby facilitating access of transcriptional factors to the regulatory sequences of the DNA. Tat interactive protein 60 (TIP60), a member of the Mof-Ybf2-Sas2-TIP60 family of HAT protein, is a multifunctional coregulator that controls a number of physiological processes including apoptosis, DNA damage repair, and transcriptional regulation. Over the last two decades or so, TIP60 has been extensively studied for its role as NR coregulator, controlling various aspect of steroid receptor functions. The aim of this review is to summarize the findings on the role of TIP60 as a coregulator for different classes of NRs and its overall functional implications. We also discuss the latest studies linking TIP60 to NR-associated metabolic disorders and cancers for its potential use as a therapeutic drug target in future.",Endocrinology,2018,"['Jaiswal B', 'Gupta A']"

This has major clinical consequences, for alcoholic and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH and NASH) account for the majority of liver disease in industrialized countries and both lack therapy. Requirements for sustained sterile inflammation include increased oxidative stress and activation of the HIF-1α signaling pathway. We demonstrate the ability of digoxin, a cardiac glycoside, to protect from liver inflammation and damage in ASH and NASH. Digoxin was effective in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis and suppressing HIF-1α pathway activation. A proteomic screen revealed that digoxin binds pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), and independently of PKM2 kinase activity results in chromatin remodeling and downregulation of HIF-1α transactivation. These data identify PKM2 as a mediator and therapeutic target for regulating liver sterile inflammation, and demonstrate a novel role for digoxin that can effectively protect the liver from ASH and NASH.",Cell Metab.,2018,"['Ouyang X', 'Han SN', 'Zhang JY', 'Dioletis E', 'Nemeth BT', 'Pacher P', 'Feng D', 'Bataller R', 'Cabezas J', 'Stärkel P', 'Caballeria J', 'Pongratz RL', 'Cai SY', 'Schnabl B', 'Hoque R', 'Chen Y', 'Yang WH', 'Garcia-Martinez I', 'Wang FS', 'Gao B', 'Torok NJ', 'Kibbey RG', 'Mehal WZ']"
29413288,Complex DNA Damage Induced by High Linear Energy Transfer Alpha-Particles and Protons Triggers a Specific Cellular DNA Damage Response.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the precise mechanism of recognition and processing of ionizing radiation (IR)-induced complex DNA damage (CDD), where two or more DNA lesions are in close proximity, in cellular DNA which is packaged with histones to form chromatin.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: HeLa and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (UMSCC74A and UMSCC6) cells were irradiated with high linear energy transfer (LET) α-particles or protons, versus low-LET protons and X rays. At various time points after irradiation, site-specific histone post-translational modifications were analyzed by quantitative Western blotting; DNA damage and repair were measured by different versions of the comet assay; and cell survival was determined using clonogenic assays.
RESULTS: Site-specific histone post-translational modifications after low- and high-LET radiation, particularly proton irradiation, were screened, aiming to identify those responsive to CDD. We demonstrate that histone H2B ubiquitylated on lysine 120 (H2B

29409480,Contrasting roles of H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 in regulation of apoptosis and gemcitabine resistance in human pancreatic cancer cells.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreas ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has the most dismal prognosis among all human cancers since it is highly resistant to chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy. The anticipated consequence of all therapies is induction of tumor apoptosis. The highly resistance nature of PDACs to all therapies suggests that the intrinsic tumor cell factors, likely the deregulated apoptosis pathway, are key mechanisms underlying PDAC non-response to these therapies, rather than the therapeutic agents themselves. The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that epigenetic dysregulation of apoptosis mediators underlies PDAC resistance to gemcitabine, the standard chemotherapy for human PDAC.
METHODS: PDAC cells were analyzed for apoptosis sensitivity in the presence of a selective epigenetic inhibitor. The epigenetic regulation of apoptosis regulators was determined by Western Blotting and quantitative PCR. The specific epigenetic modification of apoptosis regulator promoter chromatin was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation in PDAC cells.
RESULTS: Inhibition of histone methyltransferase (HMTase) by a selective HMTase inhibitor, verticillin A, significantly increased human PDAC cell sensitivity to gemcitabine-induced growth suppression. Verticillin A treatment decreased FLIP, Mcl-1, Bcl-x and increased Bak, Bax and Bim protein level in the tumor cells, resulting in activation of caspases, elevated cytochrome C release and increased apoptosis as determined by upregulated PARP cleavage in tumor cells. Analysis of human PDAC specimens indicated that the expression levels of anti-apoptotic mediators Bcl-x, Mcl-1, and FLIP were significantly higher, whereas the expression levels of pro-apoptotic mediators Bim, Bak and Bax were dramatically lower in human PDAC tissues as compared to normal pancreas. Verticillin A downregulated H3K4me3 levels at the BCL2L1, CFLAR and MCL-1 promoter to decrease Bcl-x, FLIP and Mcl-1 expression level, and inhibited H3K9me3 levels at the BAK1, BAX and BCL2L11 promoter to upregulate Bak, Bax and Bim expression level.
CONCLUSION: We determined that PDAC cells use H3K4me3 to activate Bcl-x, FLIP and Mcl-1, and H3K9me3 to silence Bak, Bax and Bim to acquire an apoptosis-resistant phenotype. Therefore, selective inhibition of H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 is potentially an effective approach to overcome PDAC cells resistance to gemcitabine.",BMC Cancer,2018,"['Lu C', 'Yang D', 'Sabbatini ME', 'Colby AH', 'Grinstaff MW', 'Oberlies NH', 'Pearce C', 'Liu K']"

29395786,An Intramolecular Interaction of UHRF1 Reveals Dual Control for Its Histone Association.,"UHRF1 (ubiquitin-like, containing PHD and RING finger domains, 1) is one of the essential components of mammalian DNA methylation machinery. Chromatin association of UHRF1 is controlled via an interplay between its intramolecular interaction and dual recognition of histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 9 (H3K9me3) and hemimethylated DNA. Here, we report the crystal structure of the N-terminal tandem Tudor domain (TTD) of UHRF1 in complex with the C-terminal polybasic region (PBR). Structural analysis reveals that PBR binding leads to displacement of the TTD-plant homeodomain (PHD) linker, as well as blockage of the H3K9me3-engaging cage, both of which contribute to a chromatin-occluded UHRF1 conformation. Disruption of the TTD-PBR interaction, which is facilitated by the binding of UHRF1 to hemimethylated DNA or regulatory protein USP7, shifts the UHRF1 conformation toward an open state, allowing for efficient H3K9me3 binding. Together, this study provides structural basis for the allosteric regulation of UHRF1.",Structure,2018,"['Gao L', 'Tan XF', 'Zhang S', 'Wu T', 'Zhang ZM', 'Ai HW', 'Song J']"

29371247,IL-35 (Interleukin-35) Suppresses Endothelial Cell Activation by Inhibiting Mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species-Mediated Site-Specific Acetylation of H3K14 (Histone 3 Lysine 14).,"OBJECTIVE: IL-35 (interleukin-35) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine, which inhibits immune responses by inducing regulatory T cells and regulatory B cells and suppressing effector T cells and macrophages. It remains unknown whether atherogenic stimuli induce IL-35 and whether IL-35 inhibits atherogenic lipid-induced endothelial cell (EC) activation and atherosclerosis. EC activation induced by hyperlipidemia stimuli, including lysophosphatidylcholine is considered as an initiation step for monocyte recruitment and atherosclerosis. In this study, we examined the expression of IL-35 during early atherosclerosis and the roles and mechanisms of IL-35 in suppressing lysophosphatidylcholine-induced EC activation.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: Using microarray and ELISA, we found that IL-35 and its receptor are significantly induced during early atherosclerosis in the aortas and plasma of ApoE (apolipoprotein E) knockout mice-an atherosclerotic mouse model-and in the plasma of hypercholesterolemic patients. In addition, we found that IL-35 suppresses lysophosphatidylcholine-induced monocyte adhesion to human aortic ECs. Furthermore, our RNA-sequencing analysis shows that IL-35 selectively inhibits lysophosphatidylcholine-induced EC activation-related genes, such as ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1). Mechanistically, using flow cytometry, mass spectrometry, electron spin resonance analyses, and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing analyses, we found that IL-35 blocks lysophosphatidylcholine-induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, which are required for the induction of site-specific H3K14 (histone 3 lysine 14) acetylation, increased binding of proinflammatory transcription factor AP-1 in the promoter of ICAM-1, and induction of ICAM-1 transcription in human aortic EC. Finally, IL-35 cytokine therapy suppresses atherosclerotic lesion development in ApoE knockout mice.

29370823,Identification of protein lysine methylation readers with a yeast three-hybrid approach.,"BACKGROUND: Protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs) occur broadly in the human proteome, and their biological outcome is often mediated indirectly by reader proteins that specifically bind to modified proteins and trigger downstream effects. Particularly, many lysine methylation sites among histone and nonhistone proteins have been characterized; however, the list of readers associated with them is incomplete.
RESULTS: This study introduces a modified yeast three-hybrid system (Y3H) to screen for methyllysine readers. A lysine methyltransferase is expressed together with its target protein or protein domain functioning as bait, and a human cDNA library serves as prey. Proof of principle was established using H3K9me3 as a bait and known H3K9me3 readers like the chromodomains of CBX1 or MPP8 as prey. We next conducted an unbiased screen using a library composed of human-specific open reading frames. It led to the identification of already known lysine methylation-dependent readers and of novel methyllysine reader candidates, which were further confirmed by co-localization with H3K9me3 in human cell nuclei.
CONCLUSIONS: Our approach introduces a cost-effective method for screening reading domains binding to histone and nonhistone proteins which is not limited by expression levels of the candidate reading proteins. Identification of already known and novel H3K9me3 readers proofs the power of the Y3H assay which will allow for proteome-wide screens of PTM readers.",Epigenetics Chromatin,2018,"['Rawłuszko-Wieczorek AA', 'Knodel F', 'Tamas R', 'Dhayalan A', 'Jeltsch A']"
29369528,Chromatin modifications in metabolic disease: Potential mediators of long-term disease risk.,"Metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes are complex diseases resulting from multiple genetic and environmental factors, such as diet and activity levels. These factors are well known contributors to the development of metabolic diseases. One manner by which environmental factors can influence metabolic disease progression is through modifications to chromatin. These modifications can lead to altered gene regulatory programs, which alters disease risk. Furthermore, there is evidence that parents exposed to environmental factors can influence the metabolic health of offspring, especially if exposures are during intrauterine growth periods. In this review, we outline the evidence that chromatin modifications are associated with metabolic diseases, including diabetes and obesity. We also consider evidence that these chromatin modifications can lead to long-term disease risk and contribute to disease risk for future generations.

29365171,Epigenomics in 3D: importance of long-range spreading and specific interactions in epigenomic maintenance.,"Recent progresses of genome-wide chromatin conformation capture techniques have shown that the genome is segmented into hierarchically organized spatial compartments. However, whether this non-random 3D organization only reflects or indeed contributes-and how-to the regulation of genome function remain to be elucidated. The observation in many species that 3D domains correlate strongly with the 1D epigenomic information along the genome suggests a dynamic coupling between chromatin organization and epigenetic regulation. Here, we posit that chromosome folding may contribute to the maintenance of a robust epigenomic identity via the formation of spatial compartments like topologically-associating domains. Using a novel theoretical framework, the living chromatin model, we show that 3D compartmentalization leads to the spatial colocalization of epigenome regulators, thus increasing their local concentration and enhancing their ability to spread an epigenomic signal at long-range. Interestingly, we find that the presence of 1D insulator elements, like CTCF, may contribute greatly to the stable maintenance of adjacent antagonistic epigenomic domains. We discuss the generic implications of our findings in the light of various biological contexts from yeast to human. Our approach provides a modular framework to improve our understanding and to investigate in details the coupling between the structure and function of chromatin.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2018,"['Jost D', 'Vaillant C']"

Inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity is a hallmark of GBM, with epigenetically distinct cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) at the apex. Targeting GSCs remains a challenging task because of their unique biology, resemblance to normal neural stem/progenitor cells, and resistance to standard cytotoxic therapy. Here, we find that the chromatin regulator, JmjC domain histone H3K36me2/me1 demethylase KDM2B, is highly expressed in glioblastoma surgical specimens compared to normal brain. Targeting KDM2B function genetically or pharmacologically impaired the survival of patient-derived primary glioblastoma cells through the induction of DNA damage and apoptosis, sensitizing them to chemotherapy. KDM2B loss decreased the GSC pool, which was potentiated by coadministration of chemotherapy. Collectively, our results demonstrate KDM2B is crucial for glioblastoma maintenance, with inhibition causing loss of GSC survival, genomic stability, and chemoresistance.",Mol Oncol,2018,"['Staberg M', 'Rasmussen RD', 'Michaelsen SR', 'Pedersen H', 'Jensen KE', 'Villingshøj M', 'Skjoth-Rasmussen J', 'Brennum J', 'Vitting-Seerup K', 'Poulsen HS', 'Hamerlik P']"

29357065,Chromatin Replication and Histone Dynamics.,"Inheritance of the DNA sequence and its proper organization into chromatin is fundamental for genome stability and function. Therefore, how specific chromatin structures are restored on newly synthesized DNA and transmitted through cell division remains a central question to understand cell fate choices and self-renewal. Propagation of genetic information and chromatin-based information in cycling cells entails genome-wide disruption and restoration of chromatin, coupled with faithful replication of DNA. In this chapter, we describe how cells duplicate the genome while maintaining its proper organization into chromatin. We reveal how specialized replication-coupled mechanisms rapidly assemble newly synthesized DNA into nucleosomes, while the complete restoration of chromatin organization including histone marks is a continuous process taking place throughout the cell cycle. Because failure to reassemble nucleosomes at replication forks blocks DNA replication progression in higher eukaryotes and leads to genomic instability, we further underline the importance of the mechanistic link between DNA replication and chromatin duplication.",Adv.

29357053,Molecular Mechanism for Chromatin Regulation During MCM Loading in Mammalian Cells.,"DNA replication is a fundamental process required for the accurate and timely duplication of chromosomes. During late mitosis to G1 phase, the MCM2-7 complex is loaded onto chromatin in a manner dependent on ORC, CDC6, and Cdt1, and chromatin becomes licensed for replication. Although every eukaryotic organism shares common features in replication control, there are also some differences among species. For example, in higher eukaryotic cells including human cells, no strict sequence specificity has been observed for replication origins, unlike budding yeast or bacterial replication origins. Therefore, elements other than beyond DNA sequences are important for regulating replication. For example, the stability and precise positioning of nucleosomes affects replication control. However, little is known about how nucleosome structure is regulated when replication licensing occurs. During the last decade, histone acetylation enzyme HBO1, chromatin remodeler SNF2H, and histone chaperone GRWD1 have been identified as chromatin-handling factors involved in the promotion of replication licensing. In this review, we discuss how the rearrangement of nucleosome formation by these factors affects replication licensing.",Adv. Exp. Med. Biol.,2017,"['Sugimoto N', 'Fujita M']"
29350772,Arsenite-induced histone H3 modification and its effects on EGR1 and FOS expression in HeLa cells.,"It is evident that trivalent arsenicals do not have mutagenicity, but they are human carcinogens. Recently, epigenetic modification has been considered as one of the important causes of arsenical carcinogenicity. Here we examined global histone H3 modification by trivalent inorganic arsenite (iAs(III)) and its contribution to gene expression in HeLa cells. iAs(III) induced histone H3K9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) and trimethylation (H3K9me3), histone H3S10 phosphorylation (H3S10p), histone H3T11 phosphorylation (H3T11p) and histone H3K9S10 trimethyl-phosphorylation (H3K9me3S10p). Among these modifications, H3S10p, H3T11p and H3K9me3S10p were observed as a punctate signal in interphase cells, which seems to associate with remodeling of the chromatin structure at the specific locus. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed to examine histone H3 modifications around the FOS, EGR1 and IL8 promoters, as previous studies revealed some relation between histone H3 modification and induction of these genes. iAs(III) increased H3S10p and H3K9me3S10p in the FOS promoter around the SRE/ELK1 binding site (-400 to -200) and CRE-binding site (-50). In contrast, histone H3 around the EGR1 promoter of SRE/CRE-binding site (-200 to -50) was modified to H3S10p and H3K9me3S10p by iAs(III). Reporter gene assays with deletion mutants of the FOS and EGR1 promoters revealed that the around SRE/ELK1 site is important for iAs(III)-mediated FOS induction, and SRE/CRE site for EGR1 induction. Collectively, these results demonstrate that iAs(III) induces histone H3 modifications around the transcription factor binding sites of the FOS and EGR1 promoter, and these modifications seem to be important in transcriptional activation of these genes.",J Appl Toxicol,2018,"['Suzuki T', 'Watanabe H', 'Kita K', 'Honma T', 'Ochi T']"

Pharmacological inhibition of BRD4 by BET inhibitors (BETi) has indicated antitumor activity against multiple cancer types. We show that BRD4 is essential for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and mediates the formation of oncogenic gene rearrangements by engaging the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. Mechanistically, genome-wide DNA breaks are associated with enhanced acetylation of histone H4, leading to BRD4 recruitment, and stable establishment of the DNA repair complex. In support of this, we also show that, in clinical tumor samples, BRD4 protein levels are negatively associated with outcome after prostate cancer (PCa) radiation therapy. Thus, in addition to regulating gene expression, BRD4 is also a central player in the repair of DNA DSBs, with significant implications for cancer therapy.",Cell Rep,2018,"['Li X', 'Baek G', 'Ramanand SG', 'Sharp A', 'Gao Y', 'Yuan W', 'Welti J', 'Rodrigues DN', 'Dolling D', 'Figueiredo I', 'Sumanasuriya S', 'Crespo M', 'Aslam A', 'Li R', 'Yin Y', 'Mukherjee B', 'Kanchwala M', 'Hughes AM', 'Halsey WS', 'Chiang CM', 'Xing C', 'Raj GV', 'Burma S', 'de Bono J', 'Mani RS']"
29343552,Constitutive centromere-associated network contacts confer differential stability on CENP-A nucleosomes in vitro and in the cell.,"Eukaryotic centromeres are defined by the presence of nucleosomes containing the histone H3 variant, centromere protein A (CENP-A). Once incorporated at centromeres, CENP-A nucleosomes are remarkably stable, exhibiting no detectable loss or exchange over many cell cycles. It is currently unclear whether this stability is an intrinsic property of CENP-A containing chromatin or whether it arises from proteins that specifically associate with CENP-A chromatin. Two proteins, CENP-C and CENP-N, are known to bind CENP-A human nucleosomes directly. Here we test the hypothesis that CENP-C or CENP-N stabilize CENP-A nucleosomes in vitro and in living cells. We show that CENP-N stabilizes CENP-A nucleosomes alone and additively with CENP-C in vitro. However, removal of CENP-C and CENP-N from cells, or mutating CENP-A so that it no longer interacts with CENP-C or CENP-N, had no effect on centromeric CENP-A stability in vivo. Thus, the stability of CENP-A nucleosomes in chromatin does not arise solely from its interactions with CENP-C or CENP-N.",Mol. Biol.

29340707,VRK1 and AURKB form a complex that cross inhibit their kinase activity and the phosphorylation of histone H3 in the progression of mitosis.,"Regulation of cell division requires the integration of signals implicated in chromatin reorganization and coordination of its sequential changes in mitosis. Vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1) and Aurora B (AURKB) are two nuclear kinases involved in different steps of cell division. We have studied whether there is any functional connection between these two nuclear kinases, which phosphorylate histone H3 in Thr3 and Ser10, respectively. VRK1 and AURKB are able to form a stable protein complex, which represents only a minor subpopulation of each kinase within the cell and is detected following nocodazole release. Each kinase is able to inhibit the kinase activity of the other kinase, as well as inhibit their specific phosphorylation of histone H3. In locations where the two kinases interact, there is a different pattern of histone modifications, indicating that there is a local difference in chromatin during mitosis because of the local complexes formed by these kinases and their asymmetric intracellular distribution. Depletion of VRK1 downregulates the gene expression of BIRC5 (survivin) that recognizes H3-T3ph, both are dependent on the activity of VRK1, and is recovered with kinase active murine VRK1, but not with a kinase-dead protein. The H3-Thr3ph-survivin complex is required for AURB recruitment, and their loss prevents the localization of ACA and AURKB in centromeres. The cross inhibition of the kinases at the end of mitosis might facilitate the formation of daughter cells. A sequential role for VRK1, AURKB, and haspin in the progression of mitosis is proposed.",Cell. Mol. Life Sci.,2018,"['Moura DS', 'Campillo-Marcos I', 'Vázquez-Cedeira M', 'Lazo PA']"

However, the functional involvement of regulatory long non-coding RNAs in these processes is not well defined. Here, we show that the long non-coding antisense transcript of GATA6 (GATA6-AS) interacts with the epigenetic regulator LOXL2 to regulate endothelial gene expression via changes in histone methylation. Using RNA deep sequencing, we find that GATA6-AS is upregulated in endothelial cells during hypoxia. Silencing of GATA6-AS diminishes TGF-β2-induced endothelial-mesenchymal transition in vitro and promotes formation of blood vessels in mice. We identify LOXL2, known to remove activating H3K4me3 chromatin marks, as a GATA6-AS-associated protein, and reveal a set of angiogenesis-related genes that are inversely regulated by LOXL2 and GATA6-AS silencing. As GATA6-AS silencing reduces H3K4me3 methylation of two of these genes, periostin and cyclooxygenase-2, we conclude that GATA6-AS acts as negative regulator of nuclear LOXL2 function.",Nat Commun,2018,"['Neumann P', 'Jaé N', 'Knau A', 'Glaser SF', 'Fouani Y', 'Rossbach O', 'Krüger M', 'John D', 'Bindereif A', 'Grote P', 'Boon RA', 'Dimmeler S']"

Yeast Dot1p lacks a SET domain and does not methylate free histones and thus may have different actions with respect to other histone methyltransferases. Here we show that Dot1p displays histone chaperone activity and regulates nucleosome dynamics via histone exchange in yeast. We show that a methylation-independent function of Dot1p is required for the cryptic transcription within transcribed regions seen following disruption of the Set2-Rpd3S pathway. Dot1p can assemble core histones to nucleosomes and facilitate ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling activity through its nucleosome-binding domain, in vitro. Global analysis indicates that Dot1p appears to be particularly important for histone exchange and chromatin accessibility on the transcribed regions of long-length genes. Our findings collectively suggest that Dot1p-mediated histone chaperone activity controls nucleosome dynamics in transcribed regions.",Nat Commun,2018,"['Lee S', 'Oh S', 'Jeong K', 'Jo H', 'Choi Y', 'Seo HD', 'Kim M', 'Choe J', 'Kwon CS', 'Lee D']"
29339544,Role of Chromatin Damage and Chromatin Trapping of FACT in Mediating the Anticancer Cytotoxicity of DNA-Binding Small-Molecule Drugs.,"Precisely how DNA-targeting chemotherapeutic drugs trigger cancer cell death remains unclear, as it is difficult to separate direct DNA damage from other effects in cells. Recent work on curaxins, a class of small-molecule drugs with broad anticancer activity, shows that they interfere with histone-DNA interactions and destabilize nucleosomes without causing detectable DNA damage. Chromatin damage caused by curaxins is sensed by the histone chaperone FACT, which binds unfolded nucleosomes becoming trapped in chromatin. In this study, we investigated whether classical DNA-targeting chemotherapeutic drugs also similarly disturbed chromatin to cause chromatin trapping of FACT (c-trapping). Drugs that directly bound DNA induced both chromatin damage and c-trapping. However, chromatin damage occurred irrespective of direct DNA damage and was dependent on how a drug bound DNA, specifically, in the way it bound chromatinized DNA in cells. FACT was sensitive to a plethora of nucleosome perturbations induced by DNA-binding small molecules, including displacement of the linker histone, eviction of core histones, and accumulation of negative supercoiling. Strikingly, we found that the cytotoxicity of DNA-binding small molecules correlated with their ability to cause chromatin damage, not DNA damage.

29338752,Structural alteration of DNA induced by viral protein R of HIV-1 triggers the DNA damage response.,"BACKGROUND: Viral protein R (Vpr) is an accessory protein of HIV-1, which is potentially involved in the infection of macrophages and the induction of the ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR)-mediated DNA damage response (DDR). It was recently proposed that the SLX4 complex of structure-specific endonuclease is involved in Vpr-induced DDR, which implies that aberrant DNA structures are responsible for this phenomenon. However, the mechanism by which Vpr alters the DNA structures remains unclear.
RESULTS: We found that Vpr unwinds double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and invokes the loading of RPA70, which is a single-stranded DNA-binding subunit of RPA that activates the ATR-dependent DDR. We demonstrated that Vpr influenced RPA70 to accumulate in the corresponding region utilizing the LacO/LacR system, in which Vpr can be tethered to the LacO locus. Interestingly, RPA70 recruitment required chromatin remodelling via Vpr-mediated ubiquitination of histone H2B. On the contrary, Q65R mutant of Vpr, which lacks ubiquitination activity, was deficient in both chromatin remodelling and RPA70 loading on to the chromatin. Moreover, Vpr-induced unwinding of dsDNA coincidently resulted in the accumulation of negatively supercoiled DNA and covalent complexes of topoisomerase 1 and DNA, which caused DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and DSB-directed integration of proviral DNA. Lastly, we noted the dependence of Vpr-promoted HIV-1 infection in resting macrophages on topoisomerase 1.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicate that Vpr-induced structural alteration of DNA is a primary event that triggers both DDR and DSB, which ultimately contributes to HIV-1 infection.",Retrovirology,2018,"['Iijima K', 'Kobayashi J', 'Ishizaka Y']"
29337181,A Non-canonical BCOR-PRC1.1 Complex Represses Differentiation Programs in Human ESCs.,"Polycomb group proteins regulate self-renewal and differentiation in many stem cell systems. When assembled into two canonical complexes, PRC1 and PRC2, they sequentially deposit H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub histone marks and establish repressive chromatin, referred to as Polycomb domains. Non-canonical PRC1 complexes retain RING1/RNF2 E3-ubiquitin ligases but have unique sets of accessory subunits. How these non-canonical complexes recognize and regulate their gene targets remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the BCL6 co-repressor (BCOR), a member of the PRC1.1 complex, is critical for maintaining primed pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells (ESCs). BCOR depletion leads to the erosion of Polycomb domains at key developmental loci and the initiation of differentiation along endoderm and mesoderm lineages. The C terminus of BCOR regulates the assembly and targeting of the PRC1.1 complex, while the N terminus contributes to BCOR-PRC1.1 repressor function.

29336876,Structural Basis of Heterochromatin Formation by Human HP1.,"Heterochromatin plays important roles in transcriptional silencing and genome maintenance by the formation of condensed chromatin structures, which determine the epigenetic status of eukaryotic cells. The trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3), a target of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), is a hallmark of heterochromatin formation. However, the mechanism by which HP1 folds chromatin-containing H3K9me3 into a higher-order structure has not been elucidated. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of the H3K9me3-containing dinucleosomes complexed with human HP1α, HP1β, and HP1γ, determined by cryogenic electron microscopy with a Volta phase plate. In the structures, two H3K9me3 nucleosomes are bridged by a symmetric HP1 dimer. Surprisingly, the linker DNA between the nucleosomes does not directly interact with HP1, thus allowing nucleosome remodeling by the ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor (ACF). The structure depicts the fundamental architecture of heterochromatin.",Mol. Cell,2018,"['Machida S', 'Takizawa Y', 'Ishimaru M', 'Sugita Y', 'Sekine S', 'Nakayama JI', 'Wolf M', 'Kurumizaka H']"
29335415,USP48 restrains resection by site-specific cleavage of the BRCA1 ubiquitin mark from H2A.,"BRCA1-BARD1-catalyzed ubiquitination of histone H2A is an important regulator of the DNA damage response, priming chromatin for repair by homologous recombination. However, no specific deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are known to antagonize this function. Here we identify ubiquitin specific protease-48 (USP48) as a H2A DUB, specific for the C-terminal BRCA1 ubiquitination site. Detailed biochemical analysis shows that an auxiliary ubiquitin, an additional ubiquitin that itself does not get cleaved, modulates USP48 activity, which has possible implications for its regulation in vivo. In cells we reveal that USP48 antagonizes BRCA1 E3 ligase function and in BRCA1-proficient cells loss of USP48 results in positioning 53BP1 further from the break site and in extended resection lengths. USP48 repression confers a survival benefit to cells treated with camptothecin and its activity acts to restrain gene conversion and mutagenic single-strand annealing. We propose that USP48 promotes genome stability by antagonizing BRCA1 E3 ligase function.",Nat Commun,2018,"['Uckelmann M', 'Densham RM', 'Baas R', 'Winterwerp HHK', 'Fish A', 'Sixma TK', 'Morris JR']"
29335368,In medio stat virtus: unanticipated consequences of telomere dysequilibrium.,"The integrity of chromosome ends, or telomeres, depends on myriad processes that must balance the need to compact and protect the telomeric, G-rich DNA from detection as a double-stranded DNA break, and yet still permit access to enzymes that process, replicate and maintain a sufficient reserve of telomeric DNA. When unable to maintain this equilibrium, erosion of telomeres leads to perturbations at or near the telomeres themselves, including loss of binding by the telomere protective complex, shelterin, and alterations in transcription and post-translational modifications of histones. Although the catastrophic consequences of full telomere de-protection are well described, recent evidence points to other, less obvious perturbations that arise when telomere length equilibrium is altered. For example, critically short telomeres also perturb DNA methylation and histone post-translational modifications at distal sites throughout the genome.

Chromatin remodelers, among others the INO80 complex, help organize chromatin by repositioning, reshaping, or evicting nucleosomes. We report on INO80 nucleosome remodeling, assayed by single-molecule Foerster resonance energy transfer on canonical nucleosomes as well as nucleosomes assembled from tailless histones. Nucleosome repositioning by INO80 is a processively catalyzed reaction. During the initiation of remodeling, probed by the INO80 bound state, the nucleosome reveals structurally heterogeneous states for tailless nucleosomes (in contrast to wild-type nucleosomes). We, therefore, propose an altered energy landscape for the INO80-mediated nucleosome sliding reaction in the absence of histone tails.",FEBS Lett.,2018,"['Schwarz M', 'Schall K', 'Kallis E', 'Eustermann S', 'Guariento M', 'Moldt M', 'Hopfner KP', 'Michaelis J']"
29329550,Systematic quantitative analysis of H2A and H2B variants by targeted proteomics.,"BACKGROUND: Histones organize DNA into chromatin through a variety of processes. Among them, a vast diversity of histone variants can be incorporated into chromatin and finely modulate its organization and functionality. Classically, the study of histone variants has largely relied on antibody-based assays. However, antibodies have a limited efficiency to discriminate between highly similar histone variants.
RESULTS: In this study, we established a mass spectrometry-based analysis to address this challenge. We developed a targeted proteomics method, using selected reaction monitoring or parallel reaction monitoring, to quantify a maximum number of histone variants in a single multiplexed assay, even when histones are present in a crude extract. This strategy was developed on H2A and H2B variants, using 55 peptides corresponding to 25 different histone sequences, among which a few differ by a single amino acid. The methodology was then applied to mouse testis extracts in which almost all histone variants are expressed. It confirmed the abundance profiles of several testis-specific histones during successive stages of spermatogenesis and the existence of predicted H2A.L.1 isoforms. This methodology was also used to explore the over-expression pattern of H2A.L.1 isoforms in a mouse model of male infertility.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that targeted proteomics is a powerful method to quantify highly similar histone variants and isoforms.

29326042,Keratin 13 gene is epigenetically suppressed during transforming growth factor-β1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in a human keratinocyte cell line.,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a biological event in which epithelial cells lose their polarity and cell-cell adhesions and concomitantly acquire mesenchymal traits, and is thought to play an important role in pathological processes such as wound healing and cancer progression. In this study, we evaluated transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1-treated human keratinocyte HaCaT cells as an in vitro model of EMT. HaCaT cells were changed into an elongated fibroblast-like morphology, which is indicative of EMT in response to TGF-β1. Phalloidin staining demonstrated the formation of actin stress fibers in TGF-β1-treated cells. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that TGF-β1 increased the mRNA levels of EMT transcription factors (SNAI2, TWIST1, and ZEB1) and mesenchymal markers (CDH2, VIM, and FN1), while it decreased the transcripts of epithelial phenotypic genes (CLDN1, OCLN, KRT5, KRT15, KRT13, and TGM1). Furthermore, we found that KRT13 was drastically suppressed through the reduction of RNA polymerase II occupancy of its promoter, which was accompanied by a decrease in active histone marks (H3K4me3 and H3K27ac) and an increase in a repressive mark (H3K27me3) during EMT. These findings indicate that the TGF-β1-induced EMT program regulates a subset of epithelial and mesenchymal marker genes, and that KRT13 is transcriptionally suppressed through the modulation of the chromatin state at the KRT13 promoter in HaCaT cells.",Biochem.

Our recent genome-wide small interfering RNA screen using recombinant HBV demonstrated that TIP60 inhibited HBV infection. Here, we show that TIP60 complex contributes to anti-HBV defense. The TIP60 complex bound to the HBV promoter and suppressed HBV transcription driven by the precore/core promoter. The silencing of EP400, TRRAP, BAF53a, RUVBL1, and RUVBL2, which form the TIP60 complex, also resulted in increased HBV transcription.

Its regulation and tissue-specific functions are poorly understood. We characterize histone crotonylation in intestinal epithelia and find that histone H3 crotonylation at lysine 18 is a surprisingly abundant modification in the small intestine crypt and colon, and is linked to gene regulation. We show that this modification is highly dynamic and regulated during the cell cycle. We identify class I histone deacetylases, HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3, as major executors of histone decrotonylation. We show that known HDAC inhibitors, including the gut microbiota-derived butyrate, affect histone decrotonylation. Consistent with this, we find that depletion of the gut microbiota leads to a global change in histone crotonylation in the colon. Our results suggest that histone crotonylation connects chromatin to the gut microbiota, at least in part, via short-chain fatty acids and HDACs.",Nat Commun,2018,"['Fellows R', 'Denizot J', 'Stellato C', 'Cuomo A', 'Jain P', 'Stoyanova E', 'Balázsi S', 'Hajnády Z', 'Liebert A', 'Kazakevych J', 'Blackburn H', 'Corrêa RO', 'Fachi JL', 'Sato FT', 'Ribeiro WR', 'Ferreira CM', 'Perée H', 'Spagnuolo M', 'Mattiuz R', 'Matolcsi C', 'Guedes J', 'Clark J', 'Veldhoen M', 'Bonaldi T', 'Vinolo MAR', 'Varga-Weisz P']"
29316949,EZH2 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma progression through modulating miR-22/galectin-9 axis.,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-induced galectin-9 expression in Kupffer cells plays an essential role in modulatingthe microenvironment of hepatitis-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, whether or not IFN-γ induces galectin-9 expression in HCC cells, its biological role and regulatory mechanism in HCC development and progression are poorly defined.
METHODS: Quantitative PCR and western blotting analysis were used to detect galectin-9 and EZH2 levels in HCC cell lines stimulated with IFN-γ. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay were utilized to confirmthe binding ofmiR-22 to the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of galectin-9. The methylation status of miR-22 promoter was analyzed by MSP (Methylation specific PCR) and BSP (bisulfite sequencing PCR), while chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay identify the occupation status of EZH2 and H3K27me3 at the promoter. Furthermore, the effect of ectopic expression of galectin-9 and miR-22 on cell proliferation, migration, invasion and cell apoptosis was assessed by using CCK-8, transwell assays and flow cytometric analysis, respectively.
RESULTS: IFN-γ induces up-regulation of galectin-9 and EZH2 in HCC cell lines. Galectin-9 is a target of miR-22 and EZH2 facilitates galectin-9 expression by tri-methylation of H3K27 on miR-22 promoter but not hyper-methylation status of DNA. MiR-22 overexpression suppressed HCC cell growth, invasion, and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, galectin-9 also exhibited antitumor effects, and restoring galectin-9 expression in miR-22 overexpressing cells strengthened its antitumor effects.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicated that EZH2 facilitates galectin-9 expression by epigenetically repressing miR-22 and that galectin-9, which is known as an immunosuppressant, also functions as a tumor suppressor in HCC.",J.

29311580,LSD1 activation promotes inducible EMT programs and modulates the tumour microenvironment in breast cancer.,"Complex regulatory networks control epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) but the underlying epigenetic control is poorly understood. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is a key histone demethylase that alters the epigenetic landscape. Here we explored the role of LSD1 in global epigenetic regulation of EMT, cancer stem cells (CSCs), the tumour microenvironment, and therapeutic resistance in breast cancer. LSD1 induced pan-genomic gene expression in networks implicated in EMT and selectively elicits gene expression programs in CSCs whilst repressing non-CSC programs. LSD1 phosphorylation at serine-111 (LSD1-s111p) by chromatin anchored protein kinase C-theta (PKC-θ), is critical for its demethylase and EMT promoting activity and LSD1-s111p is enriched in chemoresistant cells in vivo. LSD1 couples to PKC-θ on the mesenchymal gene epigenetic template promotes LSD1-mediated gene induction. In vivo, chemotherapy reduced tumour volume, and when combined with an LSD1 inhibitor, abrogated the mesenchymal signature and promoted an innate, M1 macrophage-like tumouricidal immune response. Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) from metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients were enriched with LSD1 and pharmacological blockade of LSD1 suppressed the mesenchymal and stem-like signature in these patient-derived CTCs.

29310890,The Latest Twists in Chromatin Remodeling.,"In its most restrictive interpretation, the notion of chromatin remodeling refers to the action of chromatin-remodeling enzymes on nucleosomes with the aim of displacing and removing them from the chromatin fiber (the effective polymer formed by a DNA molecule and proteins). This local modification of the fiber structure can have consequences for the initiation and repression of the transcription process, and when the remodeling process spreads along the fiber, it also results in long-range effects essential for fiber condensation. There are three regulatory levels of relevance that can be distinguished for this process: the intrinsic sequence preference of the histone octamer, which rules the positioning of the nucleosome along the DNA, notably in relation to the genetic information coded in DNA; the recognition or selection of nucleosomal substrates by remodeling complexes; and, finally, the motor action on the nucleosome exerted by the chromatin remodeler. Recent work has been able to provide crucial insights at each of these three levels that add new twists to this exciting and unfinished story, which we highlight in this perspective.",Biophys.

29301938,The linker histone H1.2 is a novel component of the nucleolar organizer regions.,"The nucleoli accumulate rRNA genes and are the sites of rRNA synthesis and rRNA assembly into ribosomes. During mitosis, nucleoli dissociate, but nucleolar remnants remain on the rRNA gene loci, forming distinct nucleolar organizer regions (NORs). Little is known about the composition and structure of NORs, but upstream binding factor (UBF) has been established as its master organizer. In this study, we sought to establish new proteins in NORs. Using UBF-Sepharose to isolate UBF-binding proteins, we identified histone H1.2 as a candidate partner but were puzzled by this observation, given that UBF is known to be located predominantly in nucleoli, whereas H1.2 distributed broadly among the chromatins in interphase nuclei. We then examined cells undergoing mitosis and saw that both H1.2 and UBF were recruited into NORs in this state, reconciling the results of our UBF pulldowns. Inhibiting rRNA synthesis in interphase nuclei also induced NOR-like structures containing both UBF and H1.2. When chromosomes were isolated and spread on coverslips, NORs appeared separated from the chromosomes containing both UBF and H1.2. After chromosomes were fragmented by homogenization, intact NORs remained visible. Results collectively suggest that NORs are independent structures and that the linker histone H1.2 is a novel component of this structure.",J. Biol.

Histone H2A.z, a variant of histone H2A, plays critical roles in chromatin structure and epigenetic regulation, but its function and mechanism in brain development remain largely unknown. Here, we find that the deletion of H2A.z results in enhanced proliferation of neural progenitors but reduced neuronal differentiation. In addition, neurons in H2A.z knockout mice exhibit abnormal dendrites during brain development. Furthermore, H2A.zcKO mice exhibit serial behavioral deficits, such as decreased exploratory activity and impaired learning and memory. Mechanistically, H2A.z regulates embryonic neurogenesis by targeting Nkx2-4 through interaction with Setd2, thereby promoting H3K36me3 modification to activate the transcription of Nkx2-4. Furthermore, enforced expression of Nkx2-4 can rescue the defective neurogenesis in the H2A.z-knockdown embryonic brain. Together, our findings implicate the epigenetic regulation by H2A.z in embryonic neurogenesis and provide a framework for understanding how disruption in the H2A.z gene may contribute to neurological disorders.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2018,"['Shen T', 'Ji F', 'Wang Y', 'Lei X', 'Zhang D', 'Jiao J']"

Here, we show that the APC/CCDC20 complex regulates Set2 protein abundance during the cell cycle. Significantly, absence of Set2-mediated H3K36me causes a loss of cell cycle control and pronounced defects in the transcriptional fidelity of cell cycle regulatory genes, a class of genes that are generally long, hence highly dependent on Set2/H3K36me for their transcriptional fidelity. Because APC/C also controls human SETD2, and SETD2 likewise regulates cell cycle progression, our data imply an evolutionarily conserved cell cycle function for Set2/SETD2 that may explain why recurrent mutations of SETD2 contribute to human disease.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2018,"['Dronamraju R', 'Jha DK', 'Eser U', 'Adams AT', 'Dominguez D', 'Choudhury R', 'Chiang YC', 'Rathmell WK', 'Emanuele MJ', 'Churchman LS', 'Strahl BD']"

29284524,Bidirectional transcription initiation marks accessible chromatin and is not specific to enhancers.,"BACKGROUND: Enhancers are modular regulatory elements that are central to the spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression. Bidirectional transcription initiating at enhancers has been proposed to mark active enhancers and as such has been utilized to experimentally identify active enhancers de novo.
RESULTS: Here, we show that bidirectional transcription initiation is a pervasive feature of accessible chromatin, including at enhancers, promoters, and other DNase hypersensitive regions not marked with canonical histone modification profiles. Transcription is less predictive for enhancer activity than epigenetic modifications such as H3K4me1 or the accessibility of DNA when measured both in enhancer assays and at endogenous loci. The stability of enhancer initiated transcripts does not influence measures of enhancer activity and we cannot detect evidence of purifying selection on the resulting enhancer RNAs within the human population.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that bidirectional transcription initiation from accessible chromatin is not sufficient for, nor specific to, enhancer activity. Transcription initiating at enhancers may be a frequent by-product of promiscuous RNA polymerase initiation at accessible chromatin and is unlikely to generally play a functional role in enhancer activity.",Genome Biol.,2017,"['Young RS', 'Kumar Y', 'Bickmore WA', 'Taylor MS']"
29280310,Osteogenic Stimulation of Human Adipose-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Using a Fungal Metabolite That Suppresses the Polycomb Group Protein EZH2.,"Strategies for musculoskeletal tissue regeneration apply adult mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) that can be sourced from bone marrow- and lipo-aspirates. Adipose tissue-derived MSCs are more easily harvested in the large quantities required for skeletal tissue-engineering approaches, but are generally considered to be less osteogenic than bone marrow MSCs. Therefore, we tested a new molecular strategy to improve their osteogenic lineage-differentiation potential using the fungal metabolite cytochalasin D (CytoD). We show that CytoD, which may function by redistributing the intracellular location of β-actin (ACTB), is a potent osteogenic stimulant as reflected by significant increases in alkaline phosphatase activity, extracellular matrix mineralization, and osteoblast-related gene expression (e.g., RUNX2, ALPL, SPARC, and TGFB3). RNA sequencing analyses of MSCs revealed that acute CytoD treatment (24 hours) stimulates a broad program of osteogenic biomarkers and epigenetic regulators. CytoD decreases mRNA and protein levels of the Polycomb chromatin regulator Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2), which controls heterochromatin formation by mediating trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3). Reduced EZH2 expression decreases cellular H3K27me3 marks indicating a global reduction in heterochromatin. We conclude that CytoD is an effective osteogenic stimulant that mechanistically functions by blocking both cytoplasmic actin polymerization and gene-suppressive epigenetic mechanisms required for the acquisition of the osteogenic phenotype in adipose tissue-derived MSCs. This finding supports the use of CytoD in advancing the osteogenic potential of MSCs in skeletal regenerative strategies.

The expression of histone methyltransferases (EHMT1 and EHZ2) and level of global histone trimethylation (H3K9 and H3K27) have been assessed and observed to be increased significantly after fluoride exposure (8 mg/L). EpiTect chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) qPCR Array (Human TGFβ/BMP signaling pathway) was performed to assess the H3K9 trimethylation at promoter regions of pathway-specific genes. H3K9 ChIP PCR array analysis identified hyper H3K9 trimethylation in promoter regions of TGFBR2 and SMAD3. qPCR and STRING analysis was carried out to determine the repressive epigenetic effect of H3K9 trimethylation on expression pattern and functional association of identified genes. Identified genes (TGFBR2 and SMAD3) showed down-regulation which confirms the repressive epigenetic effect of promoter H3K9 hyper trimethylation. Expression of two other vital genes COL1A1 and MMP13 involved in TGFBR2-SMAD signaling pathway was also found to be down-regulated with a decrease in expression of TGFBR2 and SMAD3. STRING analysis revealed functional association and involvement of identified genes TGFBR2, SMAD3, COL1A1 and MMP13 in the collagen and cartilage development/morphogenesis, connective tissue formation, bio-mineral tissue development, endochondral bone formation, bone and skeletal morphogenesis. In conclusion, present investigation is a first attempt to link fluoride induced hyper H3K9 tri-methylation mediated repression of TGFBR2 and SMAD3 with the development of skeletal fluorosis.",Environ.

29275200,Long non-coding RNA CCAL promotes hepatocellular carcinoma progression by regulating AP-2α and Wnt/β-catenin pathway.,"OBJECTIVE: Long non-coding RNAs are emerging as key molecules in cancer progression. LncRNA-CCAL has shown to be highly expressed and important in regulating CRC and osteosarcoma development. Nevertheless, the expression and mechanism of CCAL in HCC is still not well understood.
METHODS: qRT-PCR and ISH were used to evaluate CCAL expression in HCC tissues and cell lines. Histone H3 methylation and acetylation levels across CCAL promoter region were examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Transfection of Lv-CCAL-shRNAs into HCC cell lines was used to evaluate cellular invasion and proliferation. The influence of CCAL depletion on AP-2α expression and Wnt/β-catenin pathway was analyzed by qRT-PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence.
RESULTS: Higher expression of CCAL was found in HCC tumor tissues compared with normal tissues, and was associated with tumor metastasis and TNM stage. Furthermore, the decreased histone H3 methylation and increased histone H3 acetylation across CCAL promoter region contributed to the upregulation of CCAL in HCC. Moreover, the depletion of CCAL inhibited HCC cellular invasion and proliferation, and promoted cell apoptosis. In addition, CCAL depletion up-regulated AP-2α expression and inhibited Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation.
CONCLUSIONS: CCAL has an important role in hepatic carcinogenesis and may serve as a new target for HCC diagnosis and treatment.",Int. J. Biol. Macromol.,2018,"['Liu Y', 'Yang Y', 'Wang T', 'Wang L', 'Wang X', 'Li T', 'Shi Y', 'Wang Y']"
29272703,Genomic and Proteomic Resolution of Heterochromatin and Its Restriction of Alternate Fate Genes.,"Heterochromatin is integral to cell identity maintenance by impeding the activation of genes for alternate cell fates. Heterochromatic regions are associated with histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) or H3K27me3, but these modifications are also found in euchromatic regions that permit transcription. We discovered that resistance to sonication is a reliable indicator of the heterochromatin state, and we developed a biophysical method (gradient-seq) to discriminate subtypes of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 domains in sonication-resistant heterochromatin (srHC) versus euchromatin. These classifications are more accurate than the histone marks alone in predicting transcriptional silence and resistance of alternate fate genes to activation during direct cell conversion. Our proteomics of H3K9me3-marked srHC and functional screens revealed diverse proteins, including RBMX and RBMXL1, that impede gene induction during cellular reprogramming. Isolation of srHC with gradient-seq provides a genome-wide map of chromatin structure, elucidating subtypes of repressed domains that are uniquely predictive of diverse other chromatin properties.",Mol.

29269482,Nup98 recruits the Wdr82-Set1A/COMPASS complex to promoters to regulate H3K4 trimethylation in hematopoietic progenitor cells.,"Recent studies have shown that a subset of nucleoporins (Nups) can detach from the nuclear pore complex and move into the nuclear interior to regulate transcription. One such dynamic Nup, called Nup98, has been implicated in gene activation in healthy cells and has been shown to drive leukemogenesis when mutated in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here we show that in hematopoietic cells, Nup98 binds predominantly to transcription start sites to recruit the Wdr82-Set1A/COMPASS (complex of proteins associated with Set1) complex, which is required for deposition of the histone 3 Lys4 trimethyl (H3K4me3)-activating mark. Depletion of Nup98 or Wdr82 abolishes Set1A recruitment to chromatin and subsequently ablates H3K4me3 at adjacent promoters. Furthermore, expression of a Nup98 fusion protein implicated in aggressive AML causes mislocalization of H3K4me3 at abnormal regions and up-regulation of associated genes. Our findings establish a function of Nup98 in hematopoietic gene activation and provide mechanistic insight into which Nup98 leukemic fusion proteins promote AML.",Genes Dev.,2017,"['Franks TM', 'McCloskey A', 'Shokirev MN', 'Benner C', 'Rathore A', 'Hetzer MW']"
29268958,DNA methylation dynamics in aging: how far are we from understanding the mechanisms?,"DNA methylation is currently the most promising molecular marker for monitoring aging and predicting life expectancy. However, the mechanisms underlying age-related DNA methylation changes remain mostly undiscovered. Here we discuss the current knowledge of the dynamic nature of DNA epigenome landscape in mammals, and propose putative molecular mechanisms for aging-associated DNA epigenetic changes. Specifically, we describe age-related variations of methylcytosine and its oxidative derivatives in relation to the dynamics of chromatin structure, histone post-translational modifications and their modulators. Finally, we are proposing a conceptual framework that could explain the complex nature of the effects of age on DNA methylation patterns. This combines the accumulation of DNA methylation noise and also all of the predictable, site-specific DNA methylation changes. Gathering information in this area would pave the way for future investigation aimed at establishing a possible causative role of epigenetic mechanisms in aging.",Mech.

29262320,The Arginine Methyltransferase PRMT6 Regulates DNA Methylation and Contributes to Global DNA Hypomethylation in Cancer.,"DNA methylation plays crucial roles in chromatin structure and gene expression. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns, including global hypomethylation and regional hypermethylation, are associated with cancer and implicated in oncogenic events. How DNA methylation is regulated in developmental and cellular processes and dysregulated in cancer is poorly understood. Here, we show that PRMT6, a protein arginine methyltransferase responsible for asymmetric dimethylation of histone H3 arginine 2 (H3R2me2a), negatively regulates DNA methylation and that PRMT6 upregulation contributes to global DNA hypomethylation in cancer. Mechanistically, PRMT6 overexpression impairs chromatin association of UHRF1, an accessory factor of DNMT1, resulting in passive DNA demethylation. The effect is likely due to elevated H3R2me2a, which inhibits the interaction between UHRF1 and histone H3. Our work identifies a mechanistic link between protein arginine methylation and DNA methylation, which is disrupted in cancer.",Cell Rep,2017,"['Veland N', 'Hardikar S', 'Zhong Y', 'Gayatri S', 'Dan J', 'Strahl BD', 'Rothbart SB', 'Bedford MT', 'Chen T']"
29261844,Crosstalk Between Histone and DNA Methylation in Regulation of Retinal Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 in Diabetes.,"Purpose: Diabetes activates matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and MMP-9 via damaging retinal mitochondria, activates capillary cell apoptosis. MMP-9 promoter has binding sites for many transcription factors, and in diabetes its promoter undergoes epigenetic modifications, including histone modifications and DNA methylation. Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2), which catalyzes dimethylation/trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me2 and me3), is also associated with DNA methylation. Our aim was to investigate link(s) between histone and DNA modifications in the regulation of MMP-9.
Methods: Using human retinal endothelial cells, and also retinal microvessels from diabetic rats, effect of hyperglycemia on H3K27me3, and recruitment of Ezh2 at the MMP-9 promoter were quantified by chromatin-immunoprecipitation technique. Role of H3K27 trimethylation in regulating DNA methylation-transcription of MMP-9 was determined by regulating Ezh2 by its specific siRNA and also a pharmacologic inhibitor.
Results: Hyperglycemia elevated H3K27me3 levels and the recruitment of Ezh2 at the MMP-9 promoter, and increased the enzyme activity of Ezh2. Inhibition of Ezh2 attenuated recruitment of both DNA methylating (Dnmt1) and hydroxymethylating (Tet2) enzymes and 5 hydroxymethyl cytosine at the same region of the MMP-9 promoter, and prevented increase in MMP-9 transcription and mitochondrial damage.
Conclusions: Activation of Ezh2 in diabetes, via trimethylation of H3K27, facilitates recruitment of the enzymes responsible for regulation of DNA methylation of the MMP-9 promoter, resulting in its transcriptional activation. Thus, a close crosstalk between H3K27 trimethylation and DNA methylation in diabetes plays a critical role in the maintenance of cellular epigenetic integrity of MMP-9.",Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

29255264,Identification of H3K4me1-associated proteins at mammalian enhancers.,"Enhancers act to regulate cell-type-specific gene expression by facilitating the transcription of target genes. In mammalian cells, active or primed enhancers are commonly marked by monomethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1) in a cell-type-specific manner. Whether and how this histone modification regulates enhancer-dependent transcription programs in mammals is unclear. In this study, we conducted SILAC mass spectrometry experiments with mononucleosomes and identified multiple H3K4me1-associated proteins, including many involved in chromatin remodeling. We demonstrate that H3K4me1 augments association of the chromatin-remodeling complex BAF to enhancers in vivo and that, in vitro, H3K4me1-marked nucleosomes are more efficiently remodeled by the BAF complex. Crystal structures of the BAF component BAF45C indicate that monomethylation, but not trimethylation, is accommodated by BAF45C's H3K4-binding site. Our results suggest that H3K4me1 has an active role at enhancers by facilitating binding of the BAF complex and possibly other chromatin regulators.",Nat.

29249693,Site-Specific Installation of Succinyl Lysine Analog into Histones Reveals the Effect of H2BK34 Succinylation on Nucleosome Dynamics.,"Posttranslational modifications of histones play key roles in the dynamic regulation of chromatin structure. Lysine succinylation is a new type of histone modification, but its biological significance in chromatin structure and dynamics remains unknown. Here we develop a chemical approach to site-specifically install a succinyl lysine analog into histones. This analog serves as an ideal structural and functional mimic to natural succinyl lysine. The incorporation of this succinylation mimic into histone H2B at lysine 34, a succinylation site at the nucleosomal DNA-histone interface, leads to significant decrease in nucleosome stability in vitro, which is consistent with the defects in chromatin structure of a budding yeast strain containing a lysine-to-glutamate mutation at the corresponding residue of yeast histone H2B. This study provides a simple method for the rapid generation of histones with site-specific succinylation mimics, and reveals novel regulatory mechanisms of histone succinylation in the dynamic organization of chromatin.",Cell Chem Biol,2018,"['Jing Y', 'Liu Z', 'Tian G', 'Bao X', 'Ishibashi T', 'Li XD']"
29248548,Epigenetic regulation of mammalian sex determination.,"Regulation of gene expression without changing the DNA sequence is governed by epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic regulation is important for changing chromatin structure in response to environmental cues as well as maintaining chromatin structure after cell division. The epigenetic machinery can reversibly change chromatin function, allowing a wide variety of biological processes in multicellular organisms to be controlled. Epigenetic regulation ensures spatial and temporal accuracy of the expression of developmentally regulated genes. So far, few studies have focused on the relationship between epigenetic regulation and mammalian sex development, despite this being an interesting area of research. Sex development consists of three sequential stages: the undifferentiated stage, gonadal differentiation into testes or ovaries, and differentiation of internal and external genitalia. Some genetic studies have revealed that epigenetic regulation is required for proper gonadal differentiation in mice. Particularly, the epigenetic machinery plays an integral part in sex determination, which is the first step of gonadal differentiation. Mammalian sex determination is triggered by activation of the mammalian sex-determining gene, Sry, in a spatially and temporally accurate manner. Several studies have demonstrated that expression of Sry is controlled not only by specific transcription factors but also by the epigenetic machinery. Here, we focus on the epigenetic regulation of Sry expression.",Mol. Cell. Endocrinol.,2018,"['Kuroki S', 'Tachibana M']"

29244186,Independence between pre-mRNA splicing and DNA methylation in an isogenic minigene resource.,"Actively transcribed genes adopt a unique chromatin environment with characteristic patterns of enrichment. Within gene bodies, H3K36me3 and cytosine DNA methylation are elevated at exons of spliced genes and have been implicated in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing. H3K36me3 is further responsive to splicing, wherein splicing inhibition led to a redistribution and general reduction over gene bodies. In contrast, little is known of the mechanisms supporting elevated DNA methylation at actively spliced genic locations. Recent evidence associating the de novo DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3b with H3K36me3-rich chromatin raises the possibility that genic DNA methylation is influenced by splicing-associated H3K36me3. Here, we report the generation of an isogenic resource to test the direct impact of splicing on chromatin. A panel of minigenes of varying splicing potential were integrated into a single FRT site for inducible expression. Profiling of H3K36me3 confirmed the established relationship to splicing, wherein levels were directly correlated with splicing efficiency. In contrast, DNA methylation was equivalently detected across the minigene panel, irrespective of splicing and H3K36me3 status. In addition to revealing a degree of independence between genic H3K36me3 and DNA methylation, these findings highlight the generated minigene panel as a flexible platform for the query of splicing-dependent chromatin modifications.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2017,"['Nanan KK', 'Ocheltree C', 'Sturgill D', 'Mandler MD', 'Prigge M', 'Varma G', 'Oberdoerffer S']"

The major DNA repair pathway removing DNA lesions caused by exposure to UV light is nucleotide excision repair (NER). We have previously demonstrated that the endoribonuclease DICER facilitates chromatin decondensation during lesion recognition in the global-genomic branch of NER. Here, we report that DICER mediates the recruitment of the methyltransferase MMSET to the DNA damage site. We show that MMSET is required for efficient NER and that it catalyzes the dimethylation of histone H4 at lysine 20 (H4K20me2). H4K20me2 at DNA damage sites facilitates the recruitment of the NER factor XPA. Our work thus provides evidence for an H4K20me2-dependent mechanism of XPA recruitment during lesion recognition in the global-genomic branch of NER.",J. Cell Biol.,2018,"['Chitale S', 'Richly H']"

Here, we set out to determine the extent to which dynamic changes to histones affect the differentiated phenotype of ordinarily quiescent adult glomerular podocytes. To do this, we examined the consequences of shifting the balance of the repressive histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) mark in podocytes. Adriamycin nephrotoxicity and subtotal nephrectomy (SNx) studies indicated that deletion of the histone methylating enzyme EZH2 from podocytes decreased H3K27me3 levels and sensitized mice to glomerular disease. H3K27me3 was enriched at the promoter region of the Notch ligand Jag1 in podocytes, and derepression of Jag1 by EZH2 inhibition or knockdown facilitated podocyte dedifferentiation. Conversely, inhibition of the Jumonji C domain-containing demethylases Jmjd3 and UTX increased the H3K27me3 content of podocytes and attenuated glomerular disease in adriamycin nephrotoxicity, SNx, and diabetes. Podocytes in glomeruli from humans with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis or diabetic nephropathy exhibited diminished H3K27me3 and heightened UTX content. Analogous to human disease, inhibition of Jmjd3 and UTX abated nephropathy progression in mice with established glomerular injury and reduced H3K27me3 levels. Together, these findings indicate that ostensibly stable chromatin modifications can be dynamically regulated in quiescent cells and that epigenetic reprogramming can improve outcomes in glomerular disease by repressing the reactivation of developmental pathways.",J.

29224413,Low HOX gene expression in PML-RARα-positive leukemia results from suppressed histone demethylation.,"Homeobox (HOX) genes are frequently dysregulated in leukemia. Previous studies have shown that aberrant HOX gene expression accompanies leukemogenesis and affects disease progression and leukemia patient survival. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) bearing PML-RARα fusion gene have distinct HOX gene signature in comparison to other subtypes of AML patients, although the mechanism of transcription regulation is not completely understood. We previously found an association between the mRNA levels of HOX genes and those of the histone demethylases JMJD3 and UTX in PML-RARα- positive leukemia patients. Here, we demonstrate that the release of the PML-RARα-mediated block in PML-RARα-positive myeloid leukemia cells increased both JMJD3 and HOX gene expression, while inhibition of JMJD3 using the specific inhibitor GSK-J4 reversed the effect. This effect was driven specifically through PML-RARα fusion protein since expression changes did not occur in cells with mutated RARα and was independent of differentiation. We confirmed that gene expression levels were inversely correlated with alterations in H3K27me3 histone marks localized at HOX gene promoters. Furthermore, data from chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing broaden a list of clustered HOX genes regulated by JMJD3 in PML-RARα-positive leukemic cells. Interestingly, the combination of GSK-J4 and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) significantly increased PML-RARα-positive cell apoptosis compared with ATRA treatment alone. This effect was also observed in ATRA-resistant NB4 clones, which may provide a new therapeutic opportunity for patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) resistant to current treatment.

29211711,KAT2A coupled with the α-KGDH complex acts as a histone H3 succinyltransferase.,"Histone modifications, such as the frequently occurring lysine succinylation, are central to the regulation of chromatin-based processes. However, the mechanism and functional consequences of histone succinylation are unknown. Here we show that the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (α-KGDH) complex is localized in the nucleus in human cell lines and binds to lysine acetyltransferase 2A (KAT2A, also known as GCN5) in the promoter regions of genes. We show that succinyl-coenzyme A (succinyl-CoA) binds to KAT2A. The crystal structure of the catalytic domain of KAT2A in complex with succinyl-CoA at 2.3 Å resolution shows that succinyl-CoA binds to a deep cleft of KAT2A with the succinyl moiety pointing towards the end of a flexible loop 3, which adopts different structural conformations in succinyl-CoA-bound and acetyl-CoA-bound forms. Site-directed mutagenesis indicates that tyrosine 645 in this loop has an important role in the selective binding of succinyl-CoA over acetyl-CoA. KAT2A acts as a succinyltransferase and succinylates histone H3 on lysine 79, with a maximum frequency around the transcription start sites of genes. Preventing the α-KGDH complex from entering the nucleus, or expression of KAT2A(Tyr645Ala), reduces gene expression and inhibits tumour cell proliferation and tumour growth. These findings reveal an important mechanism of histone modification and demonstrate that local generation of succinyl-CoA by the nuclear α-KGDH complex coupled with the succinyltransferase activity of KAT2A is instrumental in histone succinylation, tumour cell proliferation, and tumour development.",Nature,2017,"['Wang Y', 'Guo YR', 'Liu K', 'Yin Z', 'Liu R', 'Xia Y', 'Tan L', 'Yang P', 'Lee JH', 'Li XJ', 'Hawke D', 'Zheng Y', 'Qian X', 'Lyu J', 'He J', 'Xing D', 'Tao YJ', 'Lu Z']"
29203242,An actin-based nucleoskeleton involved in gene regulation and genome organization.,"In eukaryotic cells gene regulation is dependent on global genome organization. This is achieved, in response to favorable environmental conditions, through spatial redistribution of chromatin and changes in global epigenetic levels. This eventually drives movement of gene-rich chromatin loops and formation of DNA loops, consolidating neighborhoods of gene expression and silencing. One of the challenges for future work is to examine how these neighborhoods are formed and whether they host genes involved in the same cellular functions for sustained expression or silencing over time. In the present review, we summarize evidence that actin and actin-associated proteins regulate gene activity. Furthermore we discuss how these specific nuclear tasks in which actin is engaged are important to organize and consolidate the mammalian genome, ensuring gene activation and repression of gene programs important to establish cellular identity.

29203199,Overexpression of OCT4 induced by modulation of histone marks plays crucial role in breast cancer progression.,"OCT4 is known as the gatekeeper of pluripotent embryonic state as it is responsible for maintenance of pluripotency via self-renewal of embryonic stem cells and acquisition of induced pluripotency via somatic cell reprogramming. OCT4 is responsible for oncogenic transformation by disrupting pre-scheduled differentiation programs and in general, favoring evolution of cancer cells into a more aggressive cancer stem cell phenotype. In this study, we have investigated in details, the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms responsible for over-expression and subsequent aberrant function of OCT4 in breast cancer. Expression of OCT4 in breast cancer tissues and cell lines was determined by qRT-PCR, Western blot, immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry followed by investigation of pro-tumorigenic properties such as cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis by gene knockdown and treatment with epigenetic modulators. Ectopic treatment of epigenetic modulators was done followed by MS-PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation. OCT4 is over-expressed in both of the breast cancer cell lines; MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 and its inhibition resulted in drastic decrease in rate of cell proliferation, metastatic ability and induced apoptosis. After treatment with epigenetic modulators, general increase in expression of OCT4 was observed at both gene and protein levels; however, changes of promoter DNA methylation was not found to be significant during OCT4 over-expression. Active histone marks especially H3K4me3 and H3K9acS10p were enriched in the promoter region with very low levels of repressive marks H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 indicating that active histone modifications are the deciding factor in inducing over-expression of OCT4 during breast carcinogenesis.

We reveal that humanized nucleosomes are positioned according to endogenous yeast DNA sequence and chromatin-remodeling network, as judged by a yeast-like nucleosome repeat length. However, human nucleosomes have higher DNA occupancy, globally reduce RNA content, and slow adaptation to new conditions by delaying chromatin remodeling.

In recent years, many researchers have found that a variety of malignancy, inflammatory and other diseases occurrences and developments are associated with BRD4 expression disorders or dysfunction. Meanwhile, many inhibitors of the extra-terminal (BET) family have been reported in many papers.
OBJECTIVE: This review summarized those newly found BET inhibitors, their mechanism of action and bioactivity. Secondly, those compounds were mainly classified based on their structures and their structure-activity relationship information was discussed. Beyond that, every compound's design strategy was pointed out.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Herein, the recent advances reported were reviewed for discovering more excellent small molecule inhibitors. Currently, in addition to compound 4, compounds 7, 22 and 90, have also been into the clinical trial stage. In the view of the outstanding performance of BET inhibitors in anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory and anti-drug resistance, we believe that more and more BET inhibitors will become the new epigenetic therapy for cancer, inflammation and autoimmune disease in clinical practice in the near future.",Curr Drug Targets,2018,"['Zhang F', 'Ma S']"
29180510,mRNA Processing Factor CstF-50 and Ubiquitin Escort Factor p97 Are BRCA1/BARD1 Cofactors Involved in Chromatin Remodeling during the DNA Damage Response.,"The cellular response to DNA damage is an intricate mechanism that involves the interplay among several pathways. In this study, we provide evidence of the roles of the polyadenylation factor cleavage stimulation factor 50 (CstF-50) and the ubiquitin (Ub) escort factor p97 as cofactors of BRCA1/BARD1 E3 Ub ligase, facilitating chromatin remodeling during the DNA damage response (DDR). CstF-50 and p97 formed complexes with BRCA1/BARD1, Ub, and some BRCA1/BARD1 substrates, such as RNA polymerase (RNAP) II and histones. Furthermore, CstF-50 and p97 had an additive effect on the activation of the ubiquitination of these BRCA1/BARD1 substrates during DDR. Importantly, as a result of these functional interactions, BRCA1/BARD1/CstF-50/p97 had a specific effect on the chromatin structure of genes that were differentially expressed. This study provides new insights into the roles of RNA processing, BRCA1/BARD1, the Ub pathway, and chromatin structure during DDR.",Mol. Cell.

29179726,Modulation of the functional association between the HIV-1 intasome and the nucleosome by histone amino-terminal tails.,"BACKGROUND: Stable insertion of the retroviral DNA genome into host chromatin requires the functional association between the intasome (integrase·viral DNA complex) and the nucleosome. The data from the literature suggest that direct protein-protein contacts between integrase and histones may be involved in anchoring the intasome to the nucleosome. Since histone tails are candidates for interactions with the incoming intasomes we have investigated whether they could participate in modulating the nucleosomal integration process.
RESULTS: We show here that histone tails are required for an optimal association between HIV-1 integrase (IN) and the nucleosome for efficient integration. We also demonstrate direct interactions between IN and the amino-terminal tail of human histone H4 in vitro. Structure/function studies enabled us to identify amino acids in the carboxy-terminal domain of IN that are important for this interaction. Analysis of the nucleosome-binding properties of catalytically active mutated INs confirmed that their ability to engage the nucleosome for integration in vitro was affected. Pseudovirus particles bearing mutations that affect the IN/H4 association also showed impaired replication capacity due to altered integration and re-targeting of their insertion sites toward dynamic regions of the chromatin with lower nucleosome occupancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data support a functional association between HIV-1 IN and histone tails that promotes anchoring of the intasome to nucleosomes and optimal integration into chromatin.",Retrovirology,2017,"['Benleulmi MS', 'Matysiak J', 'Robert X', 'Miskey C', 'Mauro E', 'Lapaillerie D', 'Lesbats P', 'Chaignepain S', 'Henriquez DR', 'Calmels C', 'Oladosu O', 'Thierry E', 'Leon O', 'Lavigne M', 'Andreola ML', 'Delelis O', 'Ivics Z', 'Ruff M', 'Gouet P', 'Parissi V']"
29178831,Software for rapid time dependent ChIP-sequencing analysis (TDCA).,"BACKGROUND: Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) and associated methods are widely used to define the genome wide distribution of chromatin associated proteins, post-translational epigenetic marks, and modifications found on DNA bases. An area of emerging interest is to study time dependent changes in the distribution of such proteins and marks by using serial ChIP-seq experiments performed in a time resolved manner. Despite such time resolved studies becoming increasingly common, software to facilitate analysis of such data in a robust automated manner is limited.
RESULTS: We have designed software called Time-Dependent ChIP-Sequencing Analyser (TDCA), which is the first program to automate analysis of time-dependent ChIP-seq data by fitting to sigmoidal curves. We provide users with guidance for experimental design of TDCA for modeling of time course (TC) ChIP-seq data using two simulated data sets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this fitting strategy is widely applicable by showing that automated analysis of three previously published TC data sets accurately recapitulates key findings reported in these studies. Using each of these data sets, we highlight how biologically relevant findings can be readily obtained by exploiting TDCA to yield intuitive parameters that describe behavior at either a single locus or sets of loci. TDCA enables customizable analysis of user input aligned DNA sequencing data, coupled with graphical outputs in the form of publication-ready figures that describe behavior at either individual loci or sets of loci sharing common traits defined by the user. TDCA accepts sequencing data as standard binary alignment map (BAM) files and loci of interest in browser extensible data (BED) file format.
CONCLUSIONS: TDCA accurately models the number of sequencing reads, or coverage, at loci from TC ChIP-seq studies or conceptually related TC sequencing experiments. TC experiments are reduced to intuitive parametric values that facilitate biologically relevant data analysis, and the uncovering of variations in the time-dependent behavior of chromatin. TDCA automates the analysis of TC ChIP-seq experiments, permitting researchers to easily obtain raw and modeled data for specific loci or groups of loci with similar behavior while also enhancing consistency of data analysis of TC data within the genomics field.",BMC Bioinformatics,2017,"['Myschyshyn M', 'Farren-Dai M', 'Chuang TJ', 'Vocadlo D']"
29174541,Engineered Multivalent Sensors to Detect Coexisting Histone Modifications in Living Stem Cells.,"The regulation of fundamental processes such as gene expression or cell differentiation involves chromatin states, demarcated by combinatorial histone post-translational modification (PTM) patterns. The subnuclear organization and dynamics of chromatin states is not well understood, as tools for their detection and modulation in live cells are lacking. Here, we report the development of genetically encoded chromatin-sensing multivalent probes, cMAPs, selective for bivalent chromatin, a PTM pattern associated with pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). cMAPs were engineered from a set of PTM-binding (reader) proteins and optimized using synthetic nucleosomes carrying defined PTMs. Applied in live ESCs, cMAPs formed discrete subnuclear foci, revealing the organization of bivalent chromatin into local clusters. Moreover, cMAPs enabled direct monitoring of the loss of bivalency upon treatment with small-molecule epigenetic modulators. cMAPs thus provide a versatile platform to monitor chromatin state dynamics in live cells.",Cell Chem Biol,2018,"['Delachat AM', 'Guidotti N', 'Bachmann AL', 'Meireles-Filho ACA', 'Pick H', 'Lechner CC', 'Deluz C', 'Deplancke B', 'Suter DM', 'Fierz B']"
29165574,Histone variants: essential actors in male genome programming.,"Prior to its transmission to the offspring, the male genome has to be tightly compacted. A genome-scale histone eviction and the subsequent repackaging of DNA by protamines (Prms) direct this essential genome condensation step. The requirement for male germ cells to undergo such a dramatic and unique genome reorganization explains why these cells express the largest number of histone variants, including many testis-specific ones. Indeed, an open chromatin, nucleosome instability and a facilitated process of histone disassembly are direct consequences of the presence of these histone variants in the chromatin of male germ cells. These histone-induced changes in chromatin first control a stage-specific gene expression program and then directly mediate the histone-to-Prm transition process. This review aims at summarizing and discussing a series of recent functional studies of male germ cell histone variants with a focus on their impact on the process of histone eviction and male genome compaction.",J.

29161414,Structural diversity of the nucleosome.,"In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is compacted in chromatin, which generally suppresses transcription, replication, repair, and recombination. The fundamental unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, whose structure was first determined at atomic resolution in 1997. However, recent findings have revealed that the nucleosome is not a structurally homogenous entity. Nucleosomes containing histone variants often have subtle but clear differences in their structural and functional characteristics, as compared to the canonical nucleosome. In addition to the conventional nucleosome structure, the structure of the overlapping dinucleosome, a new structural unit of chromatin, has been determined. Although archaeal chromatin adopts a unique polymer architecture, its structural unit is very similar to that of the eukaryotic nucleosome, suggesting that the archaeal histone-like protein is orthologous to the eukaryotic histones. In this article, we review the diversity of the nucleosome structures, which plays key roles in their specific functions in the epigenetic regulation of chromatin.",J.

29160738,H4K20me2 distinguishes pre-replicative from post-replicative chromatin to appropriately direct DNA repair pathway choice by 53BP1-RIF1-MAD2L2.,"The main pathways for the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination directed repair (HDR). These operate mutually exclusive and are activated by 53BP1 and BRCA1, respectively. As HDR can only succeed in the presence of an intact copy of replicated DNA, cells employ several mechanisms to inactivate HDR in the G1 phase of cell cycle. As cells enter S-phase, these inhibitory mechanisms are released and HDR becomes active. However, during DNA replication, NHEJ and HDR pathways are both functional and non-replicated and replicated DNA regions co-exist, with the risk of aberrant HDR activity at DSBs in non-replicated DNA. It has become clear that DNA repair pathway choice depends on inhibition of DNA end-resection by 53BP1 and its downstream factors RIF1 and MAD2L2. However, it is unknown how MAD2L2 accumulates at DSBs to participate in DNA repair pathway control and how the NHEJ and HDR repair pathways are appropriately activated at DSBs with respect to the replication status of the DNA, such that NHEJ acts at DSBs in pre-replicative DNA and HDR acts on DSBs in post-replicative DNA. Here we show that MAD2L2 is recruited to DSBs in H4K20 dimethylated chromatin by forming a protein complex with 53BP1 and RIF1 and that MAD2L2, similar to 53BP1 and RIF1, suppresses DSB accumulation of BRCA1. Furthermore, we show that the replication status of the DNA locally ensures the engagement of the correct DNA repair pathway, through epigenetics. In non-replicated DNA, saturating levels of the 53BP1 binding site, di-methylated lysine 20 of histone 4 (H4K20me2), lead to robust 53BP1-RIF1-MAD2L2 recruitment at DSBs, with consequent exclusion of BRCA1. Conversely, replication-associated 2-fold dilution of H4K20me2 promotes the release of the 53BP1-RIF1-MAD2L2 complex and favours the access of BRCA1. Thus, the differential H4K20 methylation status between pre-replicative and post-replicative DNA represents an intrinsic mechanism that locally ensures appropriate recruitment of the 53BP1-RIF1-MAD2L2 complex at DNA DSBs, to engage the correct DNA repair pathway.",Cell Cycle,2018,"['Simonetta M', 'de Krijger I', 'Serrat J', 'Moatti N', 'Fortunato D', 'Hoekman L', 'Bleijerveld OB', 'Altelaar AFM', 'Jacobs JJL']"
29158494,Mrg15 stimulates Ash1 H3K36 methyltransferase activity and facilitates Ash1 Trithorax group protein function in Drosophila.,"Ash1 is a Trithorax group protein that possesses H3K36-specific histone methyltransferase activity, which antagonizes Polycomb silencing. Here we report the identification of two Ash1 complex subunits, Mrg15 and Nurf55. In vitro, Mrg15 stimulates the enzymatic activity of Ash1. In vivo, Mrg15 is recruited by Ash1 to their common targets, and Mrg15 reinforces Ash1 chromatin association and facilitates the proper deposition of H3K36me2. To dissect the functional role of Mrg15 in the context of the Ash1 complex, we identify an Ash1 point mutation (Ash1-R1288A) that displays a greatly attenuated interaction with Mrg15. Knock-in flies bearing this mutation display multiple homeotic transformation phenotypes, and these phenotypes are partially rescued by overexpressing the Mrg15-Nurf55 fusion protein, which stabilizes the association of Mrg15 with Ash1. In summary, Mrg15 is a subunit of the Ash1 complex, a stimulator of Ash1 enzymatic activity and a critical regulator of the TrxG protein function of Ash1 in Drosophila.",Nat Commun,2017,"['Huang C', 'Yang F', 'Zhang Z', 'Zhang J', 'Cai G', 'Li L', 'Zheng Y', 'Chen S', 'Xi R', 'Zhu B']"
29158493,Structural and spatial chromatin features at developmental gene loci in human pluripotent stem cells.,"Higher-order chromatin organization controls transcriptional programs that govern cell properties and functions. In order for pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to appropriately respond to differentiation signals, developmental gene loci should be structurally and spatially regulated to be readily available for immediate transcription, even though these genes are hardly expressed in PSCs. Here, we show that both chromatin interaction profiles and nuclear positions at developmental gene loci differ between human somatic cells and hPSCs, and that changes in the chromatin interactions are closely related to the nuclear repositioning. Moreover, we also demonstrate that developmental gene loci, which have bivalent histone modifications, tend to colocalize in PSCs. Furthermore, this colocalization requires PRC1, PRC2, and TrxG complexes, which are essential regulatory factors for the maintenance of transcriptionally poised developmental genes. Our results indicate that higher-order chromatin regulation may be an integral part of the differentiation capacity that defines pluripotency.",Nat Commun,2017,"['Ikeda H', 'Sone M', 'Yamanaka S', 'Yamamoto T']"

Here we propose in situ Hi-C method named Bridge Linker-Hi-C (BL-Hi-C) for capturing structural and regulatory chromatin interactions by restriction enzyme targeting and two-step proximity ligation.

One attractive hypothesis stipulates that certain combinations of these histone modifications may function, alone or together, as a part of a predictive histone code to provide ground rules for chromatin folding. We consider four features that relate histone modifications to chromatin folding: charge neutralisation, molecular specificity, robustness and evolvability. Next, we present evidence for the association among different histone modifications at various levels of chromatin organisation and show how these relationships relate to function such as transcription, replication and cell division. Finally, we propose a model where the histone code can set critical checkpoints for chromatin to fold reversibly between different orders of the organisation in response to a biological stimulus.",BioSystems,2018,"['Prakash K', 'Fournier D']"
29150847,Chronic sun exposure is associated with distinct histone acetylation changes in human skin.,"BACKGROUND: Photoageing is attributed to continuous sunlight or artificial ultraviolet exposure and manifests as clinical and histological changes in skin. Epigenetic changes have been found to be involved in the pathogenesis of photoageing. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To analyse histone modification patterns in sun-exposed and nonexposed skin, and to identify the abnormally histone-modified genes related to photoageing.
METHODS: Skin biopsies were collected from both the outer forearm (sun-exposed area) and the buttock (sun-protected area) in 20 healthy middle-aged female volunteers. Global histone H3/H4 acetylation and H3K4/H3K9 methylation statuses were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression levels of histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases were measured by reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot. Chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with DNA microarray (ChIP-chip) assay with anti-acetyl-histone H3 antibody in a sun-exposed pool (combining six sun-exposed skin samples) and a nonexposed pool (combining six nonexposed skin samples) was conducted to explore the abnormally acetylated histone H3 genes related to photoageing; ChIP-qPCR was then used to verify the results of ChIP-chip.
RESULTS: We observed higher global histone H3 acetylation levels increased EP300 and decreased HDAC1 and SIRT1 expression in sun-exposed skin compared with matched nonexposed skin. Furthermore, the ChIP-chip assay showed that 227 genes displayed significant hyperacetylation of histone H3, and 81 genes displayed significant hypoacetylation of histone H3 between the two groups. Histone H3 acetylation levels on the promoters of PDCD5, ITIH5, MMP1 and AHR were positively correlated with the mRNA expression of the corresponding gene.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic sun exposure-induced histone H3 hyperacetylation may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of skin photoageing.",Br. J. Dermatol.,2018,"['Ding S', 'Chen J', 'Zeng Q', 'Lu J', 'Tan L', 'Guo A', 'Kang J', 'Yang S', 'Xiang Y', 'Zuo C', 'Huang J']"
29146919,Nucleosome acidic patch-targeting binuclear ruthenium compounds induce aberrant chromatin condensation.,"The 'acidic patch' is a highly electronegative cleft on the histone H2A-H2B dimer in the nucleosome. It is a fundamental motif for protein binding and chromatin dynamics, but the cellular impact of targeting this potentially therapeutic site with exogenous molecules remains unclear. Here, we characterize a family of binuclear ruthenium compounds that selectively target the nucleosome acidic patch, generating intra-nucleosomal H2A-H2B cross-links as well as inter-nucleosomal cross-links. In contrast to cisplatin or the progenitor RAPTA-C anticancer drugs, the binuclear agents neither arrest specific cell cycle phases nor elicit DNA damage response, but rather induce an irreversible, anomalous state of condensed chromatin that ultimately results in apoptosis. In vitro, the compounds induce misfolding of chromatin fibre and block the binding of the regulator of chromatin condensation 1 (RCC1) acidic patch-binding protein.

The unimolecular compaction, induced by divalent Mg2+ or tetravalent spermine4+ cations, studied by single-molecule fluorescence microscopy (FM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques, resulted in the formation of 250-400 nm chromatin condensates. The compaction on this scale of DNA size is comparable to that of chromatin topologically associated domains (TAD) in vivo. Variation of HO loading revealed a number of unique features related to the efficiency of chromatin compaction by multivalent cations, the mechanism of compaction, and the character of partly compact chromatin structures. The observations may be relevant for how DNA accessibility in chromatin is maintained. Compaction of saturated chromatin, in turn, is accompanied by an intra-chain segregation at the level of single chromatin molecules, suggesting an intriguing scenario of selective activation/deactivation of DNA as a result of chromatin fiber heterogeneity due to the nucleosome positioning. We suggest that this chromatin, reconstituted on megabase-long DNA because of its large size, is a useful model of eukaryotic chromatin.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2018,"['Zinchenko A', 'Berezhnoy NV', 'Wang S', 'Rosencrans WM', 'Korolev N', 'van der Maarel JRC', 'Nordenskiöld L']"
29142071,Chromatin histone modifications and rigidity affect nuclear morphology independent of lamins.,"Nuclear shape and architecture influence gene localization, mechanotransduction, transcription, and cell function. Abnormal nuclear morphology and protrusions termed ""blebs"" are diagnostic markers for many human afflictions including heart disease, aging, progeria, and cancer. Nuclear blebs are associated with both lamin and chromatin alterations. A number of prior studies suggest that lamins dictate nuclear morphology, but the contributions of altered chromatin compaction remain unclear. We show that chromatin histone modification state dictates nuclear rigidity, and modulating it is sufficient to both induce and suppress nuclear blebs. Treatment of mammalian cells with histone deacetylase inhibitors to increase euchromatin or histone methyltransferase inhibitors to decrease heterochromatin results in a softer nucleus and nuclear blebbing, without perturbing lamins. Conversely, treatment with histone demethylase inhibitors increases heterochromatin and chromatin nuclear rigidity, which results in reduced nuclear blebbing in lamin B1 null nuclei. Notably, increased heterochromatin also rescues nuclear morphology in a model cell line for the accelerated aging disease Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome caused by mutant lamin A, as well as cells from patients with the disease. Thus, chromatin histone modification state is a major determinant of nuclear blebbing and morphology via its contribution to nuclear rigidity.",Mol. Biol.

However, how multipotent progenitors (MPP) switch into common lymphoid progenitors (CLP) or common myeloid progenitors (CMP) during this process remains elusive. Here we show that PCI domain-containing protein 2 (Pcid2) is highly expressed in MPPs. Pcid2 deletion in the haematopoietic system causes skewed lymphoid lineage specification. In MPPs, Pcid2 interacts with the Zinc finger HIT-type containing 1 (ZNHIT1) to block Snf2-related CREBBP activator protein (SRCAP) activity and prevents the deposition of histone variant H2A.Z and transcription factor PU.1 to key lymphoid fate regulator genes. Furthermore, Znhit1 deletion also abrogates H2A/H2A.Z exchange in MPPs. Thus Pcid2 controls lymphoid lineage commitment through the regulation of SRCAP remodelling activity.",Nat Commun,2017,"['Ye B', 'Liu B', 'Yang L', 'Huang G', 'Hao L', 'Xia P', 'Wang S', 'Du Y', 'Qin X', 'Zhu P', 'Wu J', 'Sakaguchi N', 'Zhang J', 'Fan Z']"

A pair of readers, the PHD fingers of the protein CHD4, has been shown to bivalently recognize histone H3 tails. Here we describe a mechanism by which these linked but independent readers bind to the intact nucleosome core particle (NCP). Comprehensive NMR, chemical reactivity, molecular dynamics, and fluorescence analyses point to the critical roles of intra-nucleosomal histone-DNA interactions that reduce the accessibility of H3 tails in NCP, the nucleosomal DNA, and the linker between readers in modulating nucleosome- and/or histone-binding activities of the readers. We show that the second PHD finger of CHD4 initiates recruitment to the nucleosome, however both PHDs are required to alter the NCP dynamics.

29129908,TRIM24 is an oncogenic transcriptional co-activator of STAT3 in glioblastoma.,"Aberrant amplification and mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are the most common oncogenic events in glioblastoma (GBM), but the mechanisms by which they promote aggressive pathogenesis are not well understood. Here, we determine that non-canonical histone signature acetylated H3 lysine 23 (H3K23ac)-binding protein tripartite motif-containing 24 (TRIM24) is upregulated in clinical GBM specimens and required for EGFR-driven tumorigenesis. In multiple glioma cell lines and patient-derived glioma stem cells (GSCs), EGFR signaling promotes H3K23 acetylation and association with TRIM24. Consequently, TRIM24 functions as a transcriptional co-activator and recruits STAT3, leading to stabilized STAT3-chromatin interactions and subsequent activation of STAT3 downstream signaling, thereby enhancing EGFR-driven tumorigenesis. Our findings uncover a pathway in which TRIM24 functions as a signal relay for oncogenic EGFR signaling and suggest TRIM24 as a potential therapeutic target for GBM that are associated with EGFR activation.",Nat Commun,2017,"['Lv D', 'Li Y', 'Zhang W', 'Alvarez AA', 'Song L', 'Tang J', 'Gao WQ', 'Hu B', 'Cheng SY', 'Feng H']"

Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is currently the most widely adopted strategy for high-throughput quantification of hundreds of histone PTMs. Samples such as primary tissues, complex model systems, and biofluids are hard to retrieve in large quantities. Because of this, it is critical to know whether the amount of sample available would lead to an exhaustive analysis if subjected to MS. In this work, we assessed the reproducibility in quantification of histone PTMs using a wide range of starting material, that is, from 5 000 000 to 50 000 cells. We performed the experiment using four different cell lines, that is, HeLa, 293T, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and myoblasts, and we quantified a list of 205 histone peptides using ion trap MS and our in-house software. Results highlighted that the relative abundance of some histone PTMs deviated as little as just 4% when comparing high starting material with histone samples extracted from 50 000 cells, for example, H3K9me2 (40% average abundance). Low abundance PTMs such as H3K4me2 (<3% average abundance) showed higher variability, but still ∼34%. This indicates that most PTMs, and especially abundant ones, are quantified with high precision starting from low cell counts. This study will help scientists to decide whether specific experiments are feasible and to plan how much sample should be reserved for histone analysis using MS.",J.

Here we show that H2A.Zac containing nucleosomes are commonly redistributed to neo-enhancers in cancer resulting in a concomitant gain of chromatin accessibility and ectopic gene expression. Notably incorporation of acetylated H2A.Z nucleosomes is a pre-requisite for activation of Androgen receptor (AR) associated enhancers. H2A.Zac nucleosome occupancy is rapidly remodeled to flank the AR sites to initiate the formation of nucleosome-free regions and the production of AR-enhancer RNAs upon androgen treatment. Remarkably higher levels of global H2A.Zac correlate with poorer prognosis.

29109511,ASH1L histone methyltransferase regulates the handoff between damage recognition factors in global-genome nucleotide excision repair.,"Global-genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) prevents ultraviolet (UV) light-induced skin cancer by removing mutagenic cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs). These lesions are formed abundantly on DNA wrapped around histone octamers in nucleosomes, but a specialized damage sensor known as DDB2 ensures that they are accessed by the XPC initiator of GG-NER activity. We report that DDB2 promotes CPD excision by recruiting the histone methyltransferase ASH1L, which methylates lysine 4 of histone H3. In turn, methylated H3 facilitates the docking of the XPC complex to nucleosomal histone octamers. Consequently, DDB2, ASH1L and XPC proteins co-localize transiently on histone H3-methylated nucleosomes of UV-exposed cells. In the absence of ASH1L, the chromatin binding of XPC is impaired and its ability to recruit downstream GG-NER effectors diminished. Also, ASH1L depletion suppresses CPD excision and confers UV hypersensitivity. These findings show that ASH1L configures chromatin for the effective handoff between damage recognition factors during GG-NER activity.",Nat Commun,2017,"['Balbo Pogliano C', 'Gatti M', 'Rüthemann P', 'Garajovà Z', 'Penengo L', 'Naegeli H']"
29109278,Coordinated regulation of heterochromatin inheritance by Dpb3-Dpb4 complex.,"During DNA replication, chromatin is disrupted ahead of the replication fork, and epigenetic information must be restored behind the fork. How epigenetic marks are inherited through DNA replication remains poorly understood. Histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation and histone hypoacetylation are conserved hallmarks of heterochromatin. We previously showed that the inheritance of H3K9 methylation during DNA replication depends on the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase epsilon, Cdc20. Here we show that the histone-fold subunit of Pol epsilon, Dpb4, interacts an uncharacterized small histone-fold protein, SPCC16C4.22, to form a heterodimer in fission yeast. We demonstrate that SPCC16C4.22 is nonessential for viability and corresponds to the true ortholog of Dpb3. We further show that the Dpb3-Dpb4 dimer associates with histone deacetylases, chromatin remodelers, and histones and plays a crucial role in the inheritance of histone hypoacetylation in heterochromatin. We solve the 1.9-Å crystal structure of Dpb3-Dpb4 and reveal that they form the H2A-H2B-like dimer. Disruption of Dpb3-Dpb4 dimerization results in loss of heterochromatin silencing. Our findings reveal a link between histone deacetylation and H3K9 methylation and suggest a mechanism for how two processes are coordinated during replication. We propose that the Dpb3-Dpb4 heterodimer together with Cdc20 serves as a platform for the recruitment of chromatin modifiers and remodelers that mediate heterochromatin assembly during DNA replication, and ensure the faithful inheritance of epigenetic marks in heterochromatin.",Proc.

Here we find fewer somatic mutations in exons than expected from their sequence content and demonstrate that this is not due to purifying selection. Instead, we show that it is caused by higher mismatch-repair activity in exonic than in intronic regions. Our findings have important implications for understanding of mutational and DNA repair processes and knowledge of the evolution of eukaryotic genes, and they have practical ramifications for the study of evolution of both tumors and species.",Nat.

29104064,A Chemical Proteomics Approach to Reveal Direct Protein-Protein Interactions in Living Cells.,"Protein-protein interactions mediate essential cellular processes, however the detection of native interactions is challenging since they are often low affinity and context dependent. Here, we develop a chemical proteomics approach in vivo CLASPI [iCLASPI] (in vivo crosslinking-assisted and stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture [SILAC]-based protein identification) relying upon photo-crosslinking, amber suppression, and SILAC-based quantitative proteomics to profile context-dependent protein-protein interactions in living cells. First, we use iCLASPI to profile in vivo binding partners of the N-terminal tails of soluble histone H3 or H4. We identify known histone chaperones and modifying proteins, thereby validating our approach, and find an interaction between soluble histone H3 and UBR7, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, mediated by UBR7's PHD domain. Furthermore, we apply iCLASPI to profile the context-dependent protein-protein interactions of chromatin-associated histone H3 at different cell-cycle stages, and identify ANP32A as a mitosis-specific interactor. Our results demonstrate that the iCLASPI approach can provide a general strategy for identifying native, context-dependent direct protein-protein interactions using photo-crosslinking and quantitative proteomics.",Cell Chem Biol,2018,"['Kleiner RE', 'Hang LE', 'Molloy KR', 'Chait BT', 'Kapoor TM']"
29100699,Glucose starvation impairs DNA repair in tumour cells selectively by blocking histone acetylation.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Tumour cells are characterized by aerobic glycolysis and thus have high glucose consumption. Because repairing radiation-induced DNA damage is an energy-demanding process, we hypothesized that glucose starvation combined with radiotherapy could be an effective strategy to selectively target tumour cells.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We glucose-starved tumour cells (A549, FaDu) in vitro and analysed their radiation-induced cell responses compared to normal fibroblasts (HSF7).
RESULTS: Irradiation depleted intracellular ATP levels preferentially in cancer cells. Consequently, glucose starvation impaired DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and radiosensitized confluent tumour cells but not normal fibroblasts. In proliferating tumour cells glucose starvation resulted in a reduction of proliferation, but failed to radiosensitize cells. Glucose supply was indispensable during the late DSB repair in confluent tumour cells starting approximately 13 h after irradiation, and glucose starvation inhibited radiation-induced histone acetylation, which is essential for chromatin relaxation. Sirtinol - an inhibitor of histone deacetylases - reverted the effects of glucose depletion on histone acetylation and DNA DSB repair in tumour cells. Furthermore, a glucose concentration of 2.8 mmol/L was sufficient to impair DSB repair in tumour cells and reduced their clonogenic survival under a fractionated irradiation regimen.
CONCLUSIONS: In resting tumour cells, glucose starvation combined with irradiation resulted in the impairment of late DSB repair and the reduction of clonogenic survival, which was associated with disrupted radiation-induced histone acetylation. However, in normal cells, DNA repair and radiosensitivity were not affected by glucose depletion.",Radiother Oncol,2018,"['Ampferl R', 'Rodemann HP', 'Mayer C', 'Höfling TTA', 'Dittmann K']"
29098627,Exercise Training and Epigenetic Regulation: Multilevel Modification and Regulation of Gene Expression.,"Exercise training elicits acute and adaptive long term changes in human physiology that mediate the improvement of performance and health state. The responses are integrative and orchestrated by several mechanisms, as gene expression. Gene expression is essential to construct the adaptation of the biological system to exercise training, since there are molecular processes mediating oxidative and non-oxidative metabolism, angiogenesis, cardiac and skeletal myofiber hypertrophy, and other processes that leads to a greater physiological status. Epigenetic is the field that studies about gene expression changes heritable by meiosis and mitosis, by changes in chromatin and DNA conformation, but not in DNA sequence, that studies the regulation on gene expression that is independent of genotype. The field approaches mechanisms of DNA and chromatin conformational changes that inhibit or increase gene expression and determine tissue specific pattern. The three major studied epigenetic mechanisms are DNA methylation, Histone modification, and regulation of noncoding RNA-associated genes. This review elucidates these mechanisms, focusing on the relationship between them and their relationship with exercise training, physical performance and the enhancement of health status. On this chapter, we clarified the relationship of epigenetic modulations and their intimal relationship with acute and chronic effect of exercise training, concentrating our effort on skeletal muscle, heart and vascular responses, that are the most responsive systems against to exercise training and play crucial role on physical performance and improvement of health state.",Adv.

29095668,SUMO modification system facilitates the exchange of histone variant H2A.Z-2 at DNA damage sites.,"Histone exchange and histone post-translational modifications play important roles in the regulation of DNA metabolism, by re-organizing the chromatin configuration. We previously demonstrated that the histone variant H2A.Z-2 is rapidly exchanged at damaged sites after DNA double strand break induction in human cells. In yeast, the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modification of H2A.Z is involved in the DNA damage response. However, whether the SUMO modification regulates the exchange of human H2A.Z-2 at DNA damage sites remains unclear. Here, we show that H2A.Z-2 is SUMOylated in a damage-dependent manner, and the SUMOylation of H2A.Z-2 is suppressed by the depletion of the SUMO E3 ligase, PIAS4. Moreover, PIAS4 depletion represses the incorporation and eviction of H2A.Z-2 at damaged sites. These findings demonstrate that the PIAS4-mediated SUMOylation regulates the exchange of H2A.Z-2 at DNA damage sites.",Nucleus,2018,"['Fukuto A', 'Ikura M', 'Ikura T', 'Sun J', 'Horikoshi Y', 'Shima H', 'Igarashi K', 'Kusakabe M', 'Harata M', 'Horikoshi N', 'Kurumizaka H', 'Kiuchi Y', 'Tashiro S']"

29091772,Inheritance of Histones H3 and H4 during DNA Replication In Vitro.,"Nucleosomes are believed to carry epigenetic information through the cell cycle, including through DNA replication. It has been known for decades that parental histones are reassembled on newly replicated chromatin, but the mechanisms underlying histone inheritance and dispersal during DNA replication are not fully understood. We monitored the fate of histones H3 or H4 from a single nucleosome through DNA replication in two in vitro systems. In the SV40 system, histones assembled on a single nucleosome positioning sequence can be inherited by their own daughter DNA but are dispersed from their original location. In Xenopus laevis extracts, histones are dynamic, and nucleosomes are repositioned independent of and prior to DNA replication. Nevertheless, a high fraction of histones H3 and H4 that are inherited through DNA replication remains near its starting location. Thus, inheritance of histone proteins and their dispersal can be mechanistically uncoupled.",Cell Rep,2017,"['Madamba EV', 'Berthet EB', 'Francis NJ']"
29089515,Chromatin interaction networks revealed unique connectivity patterns of broad H3K4me3 domains and super enhancers in 3D chromatin.,"Broad domain promoters and super enhancers are regulatory elements that govern cell-specific functions and harbor disease-associated sequence variants. These elements are characterized by distinct epigenomic profiles, such as expanded deposition of histone marks H3K27ac for super enhancers and H3K4me3 for broad domains, however little is known about how they interact with each other and the rest of the genome in three-dimensional chromatin space. Using network theory methods, we studied chromatin interactions between broad domains and super enhancers in three ENCODE cell lines (K562, MCF7, GM12878) obtained via ChIA-PET, Hi-C, and Hi-CHIP assays. In these networks, broad domains and super enhancers interact more frequently with each other compared to their typical counterparts. Network measures and graphlets revealed distinct connectivity patterns associated with these regulatory elements that are robust across cell types and alternative assays. Machine learning models showed that these connectivity patterns could effectively discriminate broad domains from typical promoters and super enhancers from typical enhancers. Finally, targets of broad domains in these networks were enriched in disease-causing SNPs of cognate cell types. Taken together these results suggest a robust and unique organization of the chromatin around broad domains and super enhancers: loci critical for pathologies and cell-specific functions.",Sci Rep,2017,"['Thibodeau A', 'Márquez EJ', 'Shin DG', 'Vera-Licona P', 'Ucar D']"

However, how the chromatin-based epigenetic information beyond DNA sequence is stably transmitted along with the disruption and re-establishment of chromatin structure within a cell cycle remains largely unexplored. Through comprehensive analysis DNA methylation and nucleosome positioning patterns of HepG2 cells in G0/G1, early S, late S and G2/M phases, we found that DNA methylation may act as the prime element for epigenetic inheritance after replication, as DNA methylation was extremely stable in each cell cycle phase, while nucleosome occupancy showed notable phase dependent fluctuation. Nucleosome-Secured Regions (NSRs) occupied by polycomb-repressed chromatin played a role in repressing the irrelevant cell type-specific genes and were essential for preventing irrelevant transcription factors binding, while the well-defined Nucleosome-Depleted Regions (NDRs) marked the genes crucial for cell identity maintenance. Chromatin structure at NSRs and NDRs was well maintained throughout the cell cycle, which played crucial roles in steadily preserving the transcriptional identity of the cell to fulfill cell identity maintenance. Collectively, our results demonstrated that while chromatin architecture underwent dynamic changes during cell cycle progression, DNA methylation together with NSRs and NDRs were stable epigenetic elements that were required for faithful transmission to the daughter cell to accurately maintain cell identity during the cell cycle.",Hum.

Epigenetic mechanisms regulate transcription mediating effects of various stimuli on gene expression. These mechanisms are involved in transcriptional control in various physiological and pathological conditions including neuropsychiatric disorders and behavioral abnormalities such as depression. In rodents, exposure to chronic social stress was shown to induce behavioral impairments and memory/learning deficits that resemble depressive-like phenotype in humans. The rodent models of chronic stress were widely used to study molecular mechanisms of depression. In these models, early exposure to chronic stress such as prenatal or postnatal stress induces long-term hyperactive stress responses, behavioral abnormalities, and functional impairments in brain function that persist in adulthood. Furthermore, these alterations can be transmitted to offspring of chronically stressed animals across several generations. Molecular studies in animal models showed that chronic stress induces stable epigenetic changes in specific brain regions, primarily in the limbic system. These changes lead to long-lasting abnormalities in behavior that persist in adulthood and can be transmitted to offspring. Treatment with epigenetically active antidepressants disrupts the abnormal stress-induced epigenetic programming and provides epigenetic patterns that resemble epigenetic background of stress resilient individuals.",Curr.

Here, we present a high-resolution x-ray crystal structure of an interaction surface between ATRX and DAXX. We use single amino acid substitutions in DAXX that abrogate formation of the complex to explore ATRX-dependent and ATRX-independent functions of DAXX. We find that the repression of specific murine endogenous retroviruses is dependent on DAXX, but not on ATRX. In support, we reveal the existence of two biochemically distinct DAXX-containing complexes: the ATRX-DAXX complex involved in gene repression and telomere chromatin structure, and a DAXX-SETDB1-KAP1-HDAC1 complex that represses endogenous retroviruses independently of ATRX and H3.3 incorporation into chromatin. We find that histone H3.3 stabilizes DAXX protein levels and can affect DAXX-regulated gene expression without incorporation into nucleosomes.

29082591,The involvement of histone methylation in osteoblastic differentiation of human periosteum-derived cells cultured in vitro under hypoxic conditions.,"Although oxygen concentrations affect the growth and function of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), the impact of hypoxia on osteoblastic differentiation is not understood. Likewise, the effect of hypoxia-induced epigenetic changes on osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs is unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the in vitro hypoxic response of human periosteum-derived cells (hPDCs). Hypoxia resulted in greater proliferation of hPDCs as compared with those cultured in normoxia. Further, hypoxic conditions yielded decreased expression of apoptosis- and senescence-associated genes by hPDCs. Osteoblast phenotypes of hPDCS were suppressed by hypoxia, as suggested by alkaline phosphatase activity, alizarin red-S-positive mineralization, and mRNA expression of osteoblast-related genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed an increased presence of H3K27me3, trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3, on the promoter region of bone morphogenetic protein-2. In addition, mRNA expression of histone lysine demethylase 6B (KDM6B) by hPDCs was significantly decreased in hypoxic conditions. Our results suggest that an increased level of H3K27me3 on the promoter region of bone morphogenetic protein-2, in combination with downregulation of KDM6B activity, is involved in the suppression of osteogenic phenotypes of hPDCs cultured in hypoxic conditions. Although oxygen tension plays an important role in the viability and maintenance of MSCs in an undifferentiated state, the effect of hypoxia on osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs remains controversial. In addition, evidence regarding the importance of epigenetics in regulating MSCs has been limited. This study was to examine the role hypoxia on osteoblastic differentiation of hPDCs, and we examined whether histone methylation is involved in the observed effect of hypoxia on osteogenic differentiation of hPDCs.",Cell Biochem.

29075360,Turnover of histones and histone variants in postnatal rat brain: effects of alcohol exposure.,"BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is a significant public health problem and can result in a continuum of adverse outcomes to the fetus known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Subjects with FASD show significant neurological deficits, ranging from microencephaly, neurobehavioral, and mental health problems to poor social adjustment and stress tolerance. Neurons are particularly sensitive to alcohol exposure. The neurotoxic action of alcohol, i.e., through ROS production, induces DNA damage and neuronal cell death by apoptosis. In addition, epigenetics, including DNA methylation, histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs), and non-coding RNA, play an important role in the neuropathology of FASD. However, little is known about the temporal dynamics and kinetics of histones and their PTMs in FASD.
RESULTS: We examined the effects of postnatal alcohol exposure (PAE), an animal model of human third-trimester equivalent, on the kinetics of various histone proteins in two distinct brain regions, the frontal cortex, and the hypothalamus, using in vivo

29074626,Human THO-Sin3A interaction reveals new mechanisms to prevent R-loops that cause genome instability.,"R-loops, formed by co-transcriptional DNA-RNA hybrids and a displaced DNA single strand (ssDNA), fulfill certain positive regulatory roles but are also a source of genomic instability. One key cellular mechanism to prevent R-loop accumulation centers on the conserved THO/TREX complex, an RNA-binding factor involved in transcription elongation and RNA export that contributes to messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) assembly, but whose precise function is still unclear. To understand how THO restrains harmful R-loops, we searched for new THO-interacting factors. We found that human THO interacts with the Sin3A histone deacetylase complex to suppress co-transcriptional R-loops, DNA damage, and replication impairment. Functional analyses show that histone hypo-acetylation prevents accumulation of harmful R-loops and RNA-mediated genomic instability. Diminished histone deacetylase activity in THO- and Sin3A-depleted cell lines correlates with increased R-loop formation, genomic instability, and replication fork stalling. Our study thus uncovers physical and functional crosstalk between RNA-binding factors and chromatin modifiers with a major role in preventing R-loop formation and RNA-mediated genome instability.",EMBO J.,2017,"['Salas-Armenteros I', 'Pérez-Calero C', 'Bayona-Feliu A', 'Tumini E', 'Luna R', 'Aguilera A']"

Recent studies indicate that interdomain interactions critically influence UHRF1's chromatin-binding properties, including allosteric regulation of its histone binding. Here, using an integrative approach that combines small angle X-ray scattering, NMR spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations, we characterized the dynamics of the tandem tudor domain-plant homeodomain (TTD-PHD) histone reader module, including its 20-residue interdomain linker. We found that the apo TTD-PHD module in solution comprises a dynamic ensemble of conformers, approximately half of which are compact conformations, with the linker lying in the TTD peptide-binding groove. These compact conformations are amenable to cooperative, high-affinity histone binding. In the remaining conformations, the linker position was in flux, and the reader adopted both extended and compact states. Using a small-molecule fragment screening approach, we identified a compound, 4-benzylpiperidine-1-carboximidamide, that binds to the TTD groove, competes with linker binding, and promotes open TTD-PHD conformations that are less efficient at H3K9me3 binding. Our work reveals a mechanism by which the dynamic TTD-PHD module can be allosterically targeted with small molecules to modulate its histone reader function for therapeutic or experimental purposes.",J.

Although it has long been suspected that chromatin-based mechanisms play a role in this process, no master regulator that can specifically regulate EMT has been identified to date. Here, we show that H2A.Z can coordinate EMT by serving as either an activator or repressor of epithelial or mesenchymal gene expression, respectively. Following induction of EMT by TGF-β, we observed an unexpected loss of H2A.Z across both downregulated epithelial and upregulated mesenchymal promoters. Strikingly, the repression of epithelial gene expression was associated with reduction of H2A.Z upstream of the transcription start site (TSS), while the activation of mesenchymal gene expression was dependent on removal of H2A.Z downstream of the TSS. Therefore, the ability of H2A.Z to regulate EMT is dependent on its position, either upstream or downstream of the TSS.",Cell Rep,2017,"['Domaschenz R', 'Kurscheid S', 'Nekrasov M', 'Han S', 'Tremethick DJ']"
29061846,"A transcriptional coregulator, SPIN·DOC, attenuates the coactivator activity of Spindlin1.","Spindlin1 (SPIN1) is a transcriptional coactivator with critical functions in embryonic development and emerging roles in cancer. SPIN1 harbors three Tudor domains, two of which engage the tail of histone H3 by reading the H3-Lys-4 trimethylation and H3-Arg-8 asymmetric dimethylation marks. To gain mechanistic insight into how SPIN1 functions as a transcriptional coactivator, here we purified its interacting proteins. We identified an uncharacterized protein (C11orf84), which we renamed SPIN1 docking protein (SPIN·DOC), that directly binds SPIN1 and strongly disrupts its histone methylation reading ability, causing it to disassociate from chromatin. The Spindlin family of coactivators has five related members (SPIN1, 2A, 2B, 3, and 4), and we found that all of them bind SPIN·DOC. It has been reported previously that SPIN1 regulates gene expression in the Wnt signaling pathway by directly interacting with transcription factor 4 (TCF4). We observed here that SPIN·DOC associates with TCF4 in a SPIN1-dependent manner and dampens SPIN1 coactivator activity in TOPflash reporter assays. Furthermore, knockdown and overexpression experiments indicated that SPIN·DOC represses the expression of a number of SPIN1-regulated genes, including those encoding ribosomal RNA and the cytokine IL1B. In conclusion, we have identified SPIN·DOC as a transcriptional repressor that binds SPIN1 and masks its ability to engage the H3-Lys-4 trimethylation activation mark.",J. Biol.

E2F-responsive promoters display dynamic changes in H3K4 methylation during the course of cell cycle progression. However, how and when these marks are reset, is not known. Here we show that the retinoblastoma binding protein RBP2/KDM5A, capable of removing tri-methylation marks on H3K4, associates with the E2F4 transcription factor via the pocket protein-p130-in a cell-cycle-stage specific manner. The association of RBP2 with p130 is LxCxE motif dependent. RNAi experiments reveal that p130 recruits RBP2 to E2F-responsive promoters in early G1 phase to bring about H3K4 demethylation and gene repression. A point mutation in LxCxE motif of RBP2 renders it incapable of p130-interaction and hence, repression of E2F-regulated gene promoters. We also examine how RBP2 may be recruited to non-E2F responsive promoters. Our studies provide insight into how the chromatin landscape needs to be adjusted rapidly and periodically during cell-cycle progression, concomitantly with temporal transcription, to bring about expression/repression of specific gene sets.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2018,"['Zargar ZU', 'Kimidi MR', 'Tyagi S']"
29058710,DNA binding by PHF1 prolongs PRC2 residence time on chromatin and thereby promotes H3K27 methylation.,"Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) trimethylates histone H3 at lysine 27 to mark genes for repression. We measured the dynamics of PRC2 binding on recombinant chromatin and free DNA at the single-molecule level using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. PRC2 preferentially binds free DNA with multisecond residence time and midnanomolar affinity. PHF1, a PRC2 accessory protein of the Polycomblike family, extends PRC2 residence time on DNA and chromatin. Crystallographic and functional studies reveal that Polycomblike proteins contain a winged-helix domain that binds DNA in a sequence-nonspecific fashion. DNA binding by this winged-helix domain accounts for the prolonged residence time of PHF1-PRC2 on chromatin and makes it a more efficient H3K27 methyltranferase than PRC2 alone. Together, these studies establish that interactions with DNA provide the predominant binding affinity of PRC2 for chromatin. Moreover, they reveal the molecular basis for how Polycomblike proteins stabilize PRC2 on chromatin and stimulate its activity.",Nat. Struct. Mol.

29058709,Molecular analysis of PRC2 recruitment to DNA in chromatin and its inhibition by RNA.,"Many studies have revealed pathways of epigenetic gene silencing by Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in vivo, but understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms requires biochemistry. Here we analyze interactions of reconstituted human PRC2 with nucleosome complexes. Histone modifications, the H3K27M cancer mutation, and inclusion of JARID2 or EZH1 in the PRC2 complex have unexpectedly minor effects on PRC2-nucleosome binding. Instead, protein-free linker DNA dominates the PRC2-nucleosome interaction. Specificity for CG-rich sequences is consistent with PRC2 occupying CG-rich DNA in vivo. PRC2 preferentially binds methylated DNA regulated by its AEBP2 subunit, suggesting how DNA and histone methylation collaborate to repress chromatin. We find that RNA, known to inhibit PRC2 activity, is not a methyltransferase inhibitor per se. Instead, RNA sequesters PRC2 from nucleosome substrates, because PRC2 binding requires linker DNA, and RNA and DNA binding are mutually exclusive. Together, we provide a model for PRC2 recruitment and an explanation for how actively transcribed genomic regions bind PRC2 but escape silencing.",Nat. Struct. Mol.

In particular, it is unclear how histone marks are coupled to cellular metabolism and how this coupling affects chromatin architecture. We identified histone H3 Lys14 (H3K14) as a site of propionylation and butyrylation in vivo and carried out the first systematic characterization of histone propionylation. We found that H3K14pr and H3K14bu are deposited by histone acetyltransferases, are preferentially enriched at promoters of active genes and are recognized by acylation-state-specific reader proteins. In agreement with these findings, propionyl-CoA was able to stimulate transcription in an in vitro transcription system. Notably, genome-wide H3 acylation profiles were redefined following changes to the metabolic state, and deletion of the metabolic enzyme propionyl-CoA carboxylase altered global histone propionylation levels. We propose that histone propionylation, acetylation and butyrylation may act in combination to promote high transcriptional output and to couple cellular metabolism with chromatin structure and function.",Nat.

29057918,YEATS2 links histone acetylation to tumorigenesis of non-small cell lung cancer.,"Recognition of modified histones by ""reader"" proteins constitutes a key mechanism regulating diverse chromatin-associated processes important for normal and neoplastic development. We recently identified the YEATS domain as a novel acetyllysine-binding module; however, the functional importance of YEATS domain-containing proteins in human cancer remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the YEATS2 gene is highly amplified in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is required for cancer cell growth and survival. YEATS2 binds to acetylated histone H3 via its YEATS domain. The YEATS2-containing ATAC complex co-localizes with H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) on the promoters of actively transcribed genes. Depletion of YEATS2 or disruption of the interaction between its YEATS domain and acetylated histones reduces the ATAC complex-dependent promoter H3K9ac levels and deactivates the expression of essential genes. Taken together, our study identifies YEATS2 as a histone H3K27ac reader that regulates a transcriptional program essential for NSCLC tumorigenesis.",Nat Commun,2017,"['Mi W', 'Guan H', 'Lyu J', 'Zhao D', 'Xi Y', 'Jiang S', 'Andrews FH', 'Wang X', 'Gagea M', 'Wen H', 'Tora L', 'Dent SYR', 'Kutateladze TG', 'Li W', 'Li H', 'Shi X']"
29047414,Histone isoform H2A1H promotes attainment of distinct physiological states by altering chromatin dynamics.,"BACKGROUND: The distinct functional effects of the replication-dependent histone H2A isoforms have been demonstrated; however, the mechanistic basis of the non-redundancy remains unclear. Here, we have investigated the specific functional contribution of the histone H2A isoform H2A1H, which differs from another isoform H2A2A3 in the identity of only three amino acids.
RESULTS: H2A1H exhibits varied expression levels in different normal tissues and human cancer cell lines (H2A1C in humans). It also promotes cell proliferation in a context-dependent manner when exogenously overexpressed. To uncover the molecular basis of the non-redundancy, equilibrium unfolding of recombinant H2A1H-H2B dimer was performed. We found that the M51L alteration at the H2A-H2B dimer interface decreases the temperature of melting of H2A1H-H2B by ~ 3 °C as compared to the H2A2A3-H2B dimer. This difference in the dimer stability is also reflected in the chromatin dynamics as H2A1H-containing nucleosomes are more stable owing to M51L and K99R substitutions. Molecular dynamic simulations suggest that these substitutions increase the number of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions of H2A1H, enabling it to form more stable nucleosomes.
CONCLUSION: We show that the M51L and K99R substitutions, besides altering the stability of histone-histone and histone-DNA complexes, have the most prominent effect on cell proliferation, suggesting that the nucleosome stability is intimately linked with the physiological effects observed.

29045501,Scaffold dependent histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor induced re-equilibration of the subcellular localization and post-translational modification state of class I HDACs.,"The mechanism of action of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) is mainly attributed to the inhibition of the deacetylase catalytic activity for their histone substrates. In this study, we analyzed the abundance of class I HDACs in the cytosolic, nuclear soluble and chromatin bound cellular fractions in breast cancer cells after HDACi treatment. We found that potent N-hydroxy propenamide-based HDACi induced a concentration dependent decrease in the HDAC1 associated with chromatin and a lasting concomitant increase in cytoplasmic HDAC1 while maintaining total protein expression. No such change occurred with HDAC2 or 8, however, an increase in cytoplasmic non-phosphorylated HDAC3 was also observed. The subcellular re-equilibration of HDAC1 was subsequent to the accumulation of acetylated histones and might be cell cycle dependent. This study suggests that the biological activity of a subset of N-hydroxy propenamide-based HDACi may stem from direct competition with histone substrates of HDACs as well as from spatial separation from their substrates in the nucleus and/or change in post-translational modification status of HDACs.",PLoS ONE,2017,"['Hanigan TW', 'Taha TY', 'Aboukhatwa SM', 'Frasor J', 'Petukhov PA']"
29044188,The histone variant H3.3 G34W substitution in giant cell tumor of the bone link chromatin and RNA processing.,"While transcription as regulated by histones and their post-translational modifications has been well described, the function of histone variants in this process remains poorly characterized. Potentially important insight into this process pertain to the frequently occurring mutations of H3.3, leading to G34 substitutions in childhood glioblastoma and giant cell tumor of the bone (GCTB). In this study, we have established primary cell lines from GCTB patients and used them to uncover the influence of H3.3 G34W substitutions on cellular growth behavior, gene expression, and chromatin compaction. Primary cell lines with H3.3 G34W showed increased colony formation, infiltration and proliferation, known hallmarks of tumor development. Isogenic cell lines with H3.3 G34W recapitulated the increased proliferation observed in primary cells. Transcriptomic analysis of primary cells and tumor biopsies revealed slightly more downregulated gene expression, perhaps by increased chromatin compaction. We identified components related to splicing, most prominently hnRNPs, by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry that specifically interact with H3.3 G34W in the isogenic cell lines. RNA-sequencing analysis and hybridization-based validations further enforced splicing aberrations. Our data uncover a role for H3.3 in RNA processing and chromatin modulation that is blocked by the G34W substitution, potentially driving the tumorigenic process in GCTB.",Sci Rep,2017,"['Lim J', 'Park JH', 'Baude A', 'Yoo Y', 'Lee YK', 'Schmidt CR', 'Park JB', 'Fellenberg J', 'Zustin J', 'Haller F', 'Krücken I', 'Kang HG', 'Park YJ', 'Plass C', 'Lindroth AM']"

29040764,Rif1 promotes a repressive chromatin state to safeguard against endogenous retrovirus activation.,"Transposable elements, including endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), constitute a large fraction of the mammalian genome. They are transcriptionally silenced during early development to protect genome integrity and aberrant transcription. However, the mechanisms that control their repression are not fully understood. To systematically study ERV repression, we carried out an RNAi screen in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and identified a list of novel regulators. Among them, Rif1 displays the strongest effect. Rif1 depletion by RNAi or gene deletion led to increased transcription and increased chromatin accessibility at ERV regions and their neighboring genes. This transcriptional de-repression becomes more severe when DNA methylation is lost. On the mechanistic level, Rif1 directly occupies ERVs and is required for repressive histone mark H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 assembly and DNA methylation. It interacts with histone methyltransferases and facilitates their recruitment to ERV regions. Importantly, Rif1 represses ERVs in human ESCs as well, and the evolutionally-conserved HEAT-like domain is essential for its function. Finally, Rif1 acts as a barrier during somatic cell reprogramming, and its depletion significantly enhances reprogramming efficiency. Together, our study uncovered many previously uncharacterized repressors of ERVs, and defined an essential role of Rif1 in the epigenetic defense against ERV activation.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2017,"['Li P', 'Wang L', 'Bennett BD', 'Wang J', 'Li J', 'Qin Y', 'Takaku M', 'Wade PA', 'Wong J', 'Hu G']"

29030827,Genome-Wide Identification of Transcription Factor-Binding Sites in Quiescent Adult Neural Stem Cells.,"Transcription factors bind to specific DNA sequences and control the transcription rate of nearby genes in the genome. This activation or repression of gene expression is further potentiated by epigenetic modifications of histones with active and silent marks, respectively. Resident adult stem cells in the hematopoietic system, skin, and brain exist in a non-proliferative quiescent resting state. When quiescent stem cells become activated and transition to dividing progenitors and distinct cell types, they can replenish and repair tissue. Thus, determination of the position of transcription factor binding and histone epigenetic modification on the chromatin is an essential step toward understanding the gene regulation of quiescent and proliferative adult stem cells for potential applications in regenerative medicine. Genome-wide transcription factor occupancy and histone modifications on the genome can be obtained by assessing DNA-protein interaction through next-generation chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing technology (ChIP-seq). This chapter outlines the protocol to perform, analyze, and validate ChIP-seq experiments that can be used to identify protein-DNA interactions and histone marks on the chromatin.

29030587,NatD promotes lung cancer progression by preventing histone H4 serine phosphorylation to activate Slug expression.,"N-α-acetyltransferase D (NatD) mediates N-α-terminal acetylation (Nt-acetylation) of histone H4 known to be involved in cell growth. Here we report that NatD promotes the migratory and invasive capabilities of lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Depletion of NatD suppresses the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of lung cancer cells by directly repressing the expression of transcription factor Slug, a key regulator of EMT. We found that Nt-acetylation of histone H4 antagonizes histone H4 serine 1 phosphorylation (H4S1ph), and that downregulation of Nt-acetylation of histone H4 facilitates CK2α binding to histone H4 in lung cancer cells, resulting in increased H4S1ph and epigenetic reprogramming to suppress Slug transcription to inhibit EMT. Importantly, NatD is commonly upregulated in primary human lung cancer tissues where its expression level correlates with Slug expression, enhanced invasiveness, and poor clinical outcomes. These findings indicate that NatD is a crucial epigenetic modulator of cell invasion during lung cancer progression.NatD is an acetyltransferase responsible for N-α-terminal acetylation of the histone H4 and H2A and has been linked to cell growth. Here the authors show that NatD-mediated acetylation of histone H4 serine 1 competes with the phosphorylation by CK2α at the same residue thus leading to the upregulation of Slug and tumor progression.",Nat Commun,2017,"['Ju J', 'Chen A', 'Deng Y', 'Liu M', 'Wang Y', 'Wang Y', 'Nie M', 'Wang C', 'Ding H', 'Yao B', 'Gui T', 'Li X', 'Xu Z', 'Ma C', 'Song Y', 'Kvansakul M', 'Zen K', 'Zhang CY', 'Luo C', 'Fang M', 'Huang DCS', 'Allis CD', 'Tan R', 'Zeng CK', 'Wei J', 'Zhao Q']"

The tandem PHD fingers of CHD3 bind histone H3 tails and posttranslational modifications that increase hydrophobicity of H3K9-methylation or acetylation (H3K9me3 or H3K9ac)-enhance this interaction.

H1 binds to the nucleosome to form the next structural unit of metazoan chromatin, the chromatosome, which may help chromatin to fold into higher-order structures. Despite their important roles in regulating the structure and function of chromatin, linker histones have not been studied as extensively as core histones. Nevertheless, substantial progress has been made recently. The first near-atomic resolution crystal structure of a chromatosome core particle and an 11 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy-derived structure of the 30 nm nucleosome array have been determined, revealing unprecedented details about how linker histones interact with the nucleosome and organize higher-order chromatin structures. Moreover, several new functions of linker histones have been discovered, including their roles in epigenetic regulation and the regulation of DNA replication, DNA repair and genome stability.

29018219,Spatially restricted loading of BRD2 at DNA double-strand breaks protects H4 acetylation domains and promotes DNA repair.,"The n-terminal tail of histone H4 recruits repair proteins, including 53BP1, to DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) and undergoes dynamic acetylation during DSB repair. However, how H4 acetylation (H4Ac) recruits repair proteins and reorganizes chromatin during DNA repair is unclear. Here, we show that the bromodomain protein BRD2 is recruited to DSBs. This recruitment requires binding of BRD2's tandem bromodomains to H4Ac, which is generated at DSBs by the Tip60/KAT5 acetyltransferase. Binding of BRD2 to H4Ac protects the underlying acetylated chromatin from attack by histone deacetylases and allows acetylation to spread along the flanking chromatin. However, BRD2 recruitment is spatially restricted to a chromatin domain extending only 2 kb either side of the DSB, and BRD2 does not spread into the chromatin domains flanking the break. Instead, BRD2 facilitates recruitment of a second bromodomain protein, ZMYND8, which spreads along the flanking chromatin, but is excluded from the DSB region. This creates a spatially restricted H4Ac/BRD2 domain which reorganizes chromatin at DSBs, limits binding of the L3MBTL1 repressor and promotes 53BP1 binding, while limiting end-resection of DSBs. BRD2 therefore creates a restricted chromatin environment surrounding DSBs which facilitates DSB repair and which is framed by extensive ZMYND8 domains on the flanking chromatin.",Sci Rep,2017,"['Gursoy-Yuzugullu O', 'Carman C', 'Price BD']"
28991226,LSD1 promotes S-phase entry and tumorigenesis via chromatin co-occupation with E2F1 and selective H3K9 demethylation.,"Histone H3 lysine-9 (H3K9) methylation is essential for retinoblastoma protein (RB)-mediated heterochromatin formation, epigenetic silencing of S-phase genes and permanent cell cycle arrest or cellular senescence. Besides as an H3K4 demethylase, lysine-specific demethylase-1 (LSD1) has been shown to promote H3K9 demethylation. However, it is unexplored whether LSD1 has a causal role in regulating cell cycle entry and senescence. Here we demonstrate that genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition of LSD1 triggers G1 arrest and cellular senescence. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing analysis reveals that LSD1 binding sites overlap significantly with those bound by the S-phase gene transcription factor E2F1. Gene ontology analysis demonstrates that a large portion of E2F1 and LSD1 cotargeted genes are involved in cell cycle and proliferation. Further analyses show that depletion of LSD1 increases the level of H3K9me2 and thereby represses expression of the LSD1-E2F1 cotarget genes, but has no effects on H3K4me2 level in those loci. In contrast, knockdown of the H3K4me2 reader PHF8 decreases the H3K4me2 level at the LSD1-E2F1 cotargeted loci, but this effect is rescued by codepletion of LSD1. Furthermore, the enzymatic activity of LSD1 is essential for H3K9me2 demethylation at cell cycle gene loci. Notably, cotreatment of chemotherapeutic agent camptothecin enhanced LSD1 inhibitor-induced senescence and growth inhibition of cancer cells in vitro and in mice. Our data reveal LSD1 as a molecular rheostat selectively regulating H3K9 demethylation at cell cycle gene loci, thereby representing a key player in oncogenesis and a viable target for cancer therapy.",Oncogene,2018,"['He Y', 'Zhao Y', 'Wang L', 'Bohrer LR', 'Pan Y', 'Wang L', 'Huang H']"

Due to the complex interactions involved, it is currently not understood how effectors dynamically sample the chromatin landscape. Here, we dissect the dynamic chromatin interactions of a family of multivalent effectors, heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) proteins, using single-molecule fluorescence imaging and computational modeling. We show that the three human HP1 isoforms are recruited and retained on chromatin by a dynamic exchange between histone PTM and DNA bound states. These interactions depend on local chromatin structure, the HP1 isoforms as well as on PTMs on HP1 itself. Of the HP1 isoforms, HP1α exhibits the longest residence times and fastest binding rates due to DNA interactions in addition to PTM binding. HP1α phosphorylation further increases chromatin retention through strengthening of multivalency while reducing DNA binding. As DNA binding in combination with specific PTM recognition is found in many chromatin effectors, we propose a general dynamic capture mechanism for effector recruitment. Multiple weak protein and DNA interactions result in a multivalent interaction network that targets effectors to a specific chromatin modification state, where their activity is required.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2017,"['Bryan LC', 'Weilandt DR', 'Bachmann AL', 'Kilic S', 'Lechner CC', 'Odermatt PD', 'Fantner GE', 'Georgeon S', 'Hantschel O', 'Hatzimanikatis V', 'Fierz B']"

28981850,Histone chaperone HIRA deposits histone H3.3 onto foreign viral DNA and contributes to anti-viral intrinsic immunity.,"The HIRA histone chaperone complex deposits histone H3.3 into nucleosomes in a DNA replication- and sequence-independent manner. As herpesvirus genomes enter the nucleus as naked DNA, we asked whether the HIRA chaperone complex affects herpesvirus infection. After infection of primary cells with HSV or CMV, or transient transfection with naked plasmid DNA, HIRA re-localizes to PML bodies, sites of cellular anti-viral activity. HIRA co-localizes with viral genomes, binds to incoming viral and plasmid DNAs and deposits histone H3.3 onto these. Anti-viral interferons (IFN) specifically induce HIRA/PML co-localization at PML nuclear bodies and HIRA recruitment to IFN target genes, although HIRA is not required for IFN-inducible expression of these genes. HIRA is, however, required for suppression of viral gene expression, virus replication and lytic infection and restricts murine CMV replication in vivo. We propose that the HIRA chaperone complex represses incoming naked viral DNAs through chromatinization as part of intrinsic cellular immunity.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2017,"['Rai TS', 'Glass M', 'Cole JJ', 'Rather MI', 'Marsden M', 'Neilson M', 'Brock C', 'Humphreys IR', 'Everett RD', 'Adams PD']"

This feature makes DMS-seq simple in practice and removes the potential risk of protein re-localization during nuclear isolation. DMS-seq successfully detects transcription factors bound to cis-regulatory elements and non-canonical chromatin particles in nucleosome-free regions. Furthermore, an unexpected preference of DMS confers on DMS-seq a unique potential to directly detect nucleosome centers without using genetic manipulation.

28977641,PP32 and SET/TAF-Iβ proteins regulate the acetylation of newly synthesized histone H4.,"Newly synthesized histones H3 and H4 undergo a cascade of maturation steps to achieve proper folding and to establish post-translational modifications prior to chromatin deposition. Acetylation of H4 on lysines 5 and 12 by the HAT1 acetyltransferase is observed late in the histone maturation cascade. A key question is to understand how to establish and regulate the distinct timing of sequential modifications and their biological significance. Here, we perform proteomic analysis of the newly synthesized histone H4 complex at the earliest time point in the cascade. In addition to known binding partners Hsp90 and Hsp70, we also identify for the first time two subunits of the histone acetyltransferase inhibitor complex (INHAT): PP32 and SET/TAF-Iβ. We show that both proteins function to prevent HAT1-mediated H4 acetylation in vitro. When PP32 and SET/TAF-Iβ protein levels are down-regulated in vivo, we detect hyperacetylation on lysines 5 and 12 and other H4 lysine residues. Notably, aberrantly acetylated H4 is less stable and this reduces the interaction with Hsp90. As a consequence, PP32 and SET/TAF-Iβ depleted cells show an S-phase arrest. Our data demonstrate a novel function of PP32 and SET/TAF-Iβ and provide new insight into the mechanisms regulating acetylation of newly synthesized histone H4.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2017,"['Saavedra F', 'Rivera C', 'Rivas E', 'Merino P', 'Garrido D', 'Hernández S', 'Forné I', 'Vassias I', 'Gurard-Levin ZA', 'Alfaro IE', 'Imhof A', 'Almouzni G', 'Loyola A']"
28977591,Novel Function of a Transcription Factor WT1 in Regulating Decidualization in Human Endometrial Stromal Cells and Its Molecular Mechanism.,"The Wilms tumor suppressor gene (WT1) encodes an essential transcription factor regulating mammalian urogenital development. However, the function of WT1 in human endometrium is still unclear. The current study examined the involvement of WT1 in the regulation of IGF-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) and prolactin (PRL), which are specific markers of decidualization, in human endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) undergoing decidualization. ESCs isolated from proliferative-phase endometrium were incubated with cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) to induce decidualization. cAMP increased WT1 expression with the induction of IGFBP-1 and PRL. Knockdown of WT1 by small interfering RNA inhibited cAMP-induced expression of IGFBP-1 and PRL. cAMP also induced the recruitment of WT1 to the IGFBP-1 and PRL promoters. To investigate the mechanism by which WT1 is upregulated by cAMP, we focused on C/EBPβ, a gene that regulates the expression of many genes during decidualization. Knockdown of C/EBPβ decreased cAMP-increased WT1 expression. cAMP increased the recruitment of C/EBPβ to the WT1 enhancer that is located approximately 14,000 bp downstream from the transcription start site. To test the endogenous function of the WT1 enhancer region on WT1 expression, the endogenous WT1 enhancer region was deleted by CRISPR/Cas9 system in HEK293 cells. The increase of WT1 expression by cAMP was not observed in the enhancer-deleted clones. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that this enhancer region has high levels of H3K27ac and H3K4me1, which are active enhancer marks. These results show the role of WT1 in regulating decidualization in human ESCs.

H3/H4-bound cccDNA was detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. The deacetylase inhibitors trichostatin A and sodium butyrate were used to study the mechanism of action for curcumin. Additionally, short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting HBV were tested along with curcumin.
RESULTS: Curcumin treatment led to time- and dose-dependent reductions in HBsAg and HBeAg expression and significant reductions in intracellular HBV DNA replication intermediates and HBV cccDNA. After treatment with 20 μmol/L curcumin for 2 d, HBsAg and cccDNA levels in HepG2.2.15 cells were reduced by up to 57.7% (

28973458,TET2- and TDG-mediated changes are required for the acquisition of distinct histone modifications in divergent terminal differentiation of myeloid cells.,"The plasticity of myeloid cells is illustrated by a diversity of functions including their role as effectors of innate immunity as macrophages (MACs) and bone remodelling as osteoclasts (OCs). TET2, a methylcytosine dioxygenase highly expressed in these cells and frequently mutated in myeloid leukemias, may be a key contributor to this plasticity. Through transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses, we investigated 5-methylcytosine (5mC), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and gene expression changes in two divergent terminal myeloid differentiation processes, namely MAC and OC differentiation. MACs and OCs undergo highly similar 5hmC and 5mC changes, despite their wide differences in gene expression. Many TET2- and thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG)-dependent 5mC and 5hmC changes directly activate the common terminal myeloid differentiation programme. However, the acquisition of differential features between MACs and OCs also depends on TET2/TDG. In fact, 5mC oxidation precedes differential histone modification changes between MACs and OCs. TET2 and TDG downregulation impairs the acquisition of such differential histone modification and expression patterns at MAC-/OC-specific genes. We prove that the histone H3K4 methyltransferase SETD1A is differentially recruited between MACs and OCs in a TET2-dependent manner. We demonstrate a novel role of these enzymes in the establishment of specific elements of identity and function in terminal myeloid differentiation.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2017,"['Garcia-Gomez A', 'Li T', 'Kerick M', 'Català-Moll F', 'Comet NR', 'Rodríguez-Ubreva J', 'de la Rica L', 'Branco MR', 'Martín J', 'Ballestar E']"
28973456,Accurate and reproducible functional maps in 127 human cell types via 2D genome segmentation.,"The Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium has published whole-genome functional annotation maps in 127 human cell types by integrating data from studies of multiple epigenetic marks. These maps have been widely used for studying gene regulation in cell type-specific contexts and predicting the functional impact of DNA mutations on disease. Here, we present a new map of functional elements produced by applying a method called IDEAS on the same data. The method has several unique advantages and outperforms existing methods, including that used by the Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium. Using five categories of independent experimental datasets, we compared the IDEAS and Roadmap Epigenomics maps. While the overall concordance between the two maps is high, the maps differ substantially in the prediction details and in their consistency of annotation of a given genomic position across cell types. The annotation from IDEAS is uniformly more accurate than the Roadmap Epigenomics annotation and the improvement is substantial based on several criteria. We further introduce a pipeline that improves the reproducibility of functional annotation maps. Thus, we provide a high-quality map of candidate functional regions across 127 human cell types and compare the quality of different annotation methods in order to facilitate biomedical research in epigenomics.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2017,"['Zhang Y', 'Hardison RC']"

28973435,HMGN1 and 2 remodel core and linker histone tail domains within chromatin.,"The structure of the nucleosome, the basic building block of the chromatin fiber, plays a key role in epigenetic regulatory processes that affect DNA-dependent processes in the context of chromatin. Members of the HMGN family of proteins bind specifically to nucleosomes and affect chromatin structure and function, including transcription and DNA repair. To better understand the mechanisms by which HMGN 1 and 2 alter chromatin, we analyzed their effect on the organization of histone tails and linker histone H1 in nucleosomes. We find that HMGNs counteract linker histone (H1)-dependent stabilization of higher order 'tertiary' chromatin structures but do not alter the intrinsic ability of nucleosome arrays to undergo salt-induced compaction and self-association. Surprisingly, HMGNs do not displace H1s from nucleosomes; rather these proteins bind nucleosomes simultaneously with H1s without disturbing specific contacts between the H1 globular domain and nucleosomal DNA. However, HMGNs do alter the nucleosome-dependent condensation of the linker histone C-terminal domain, which is critical for stabilizing higher-order chromatin structures. Moreover, HMGNs affect the interactions of the core histone tail domains with nucleosomal DNA, redirecting the tails to more interior positions within the nucleosome. Our studies provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms whereby HMGNs affect chromatin structure.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2017,"['Murphy KJ', 'Cutter AR', 'Fang H', 'Postnikov YV', 'Bustin M', 'Hayes JJ']"
28973434,dCas9-based epigenome editing suggests acquisition of histone methylation is not sufficient for target gene repression.,"Distinct epigenomic profiles of histone marks have been associated with gene expression, but questions regarding the causal relationship remain. Here we investigated the activity of a broad collection of genomically targeted epigenetic regulators that could write epigenetic marks associated with a repressed chromatin state (G9A, SUV39H1, Krüppel-associated box (KRAB), DNMT3A as well as the first targetable versions of Ezh2 and Friend of GATA-1 (FOG1)). dCas9 fusions produced target gene repression over a range of 0- to 10-fold that varied by locus and cell type. dCpf1 fusions were unable to repress gene expression. The most persistent gene repression required the action of several effector domains; however, KRAB-dCas9 did not contribute to persistence in contrast to previous reports. A 'direct tethering' strategy attaching the Ezh2 methyltransferase enzyme to dCas9, as well as a 'recruitment' strategy attaching the N-terminal 45 residues of FOG1 to dCas9 to recruit the endogenous nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex, were both successful in targeted deposition of H3K27me3. Surprisingly, however, repression was not correlated with deposition of either H3K9me3 or H3K27me3. Our results suggest that so-called repressive histone modifications are not sufficient for gene repression. The easily programmable dCas9 toolkit allowed precise control of epigenetic information and dissection of the relationship between the epigenome and gene regulation.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2017,"[""O'Geen H"", 'Ren C', 'Nicolet CM', 'Perez AA', 'Halmai J', 'Le VM', 'Mackay JP', 'Farnham PJ', 'Segal DJ']"
28970247,Chromatin remodeling: demethylating H3K4me3 of type I IFNs gene by Rbp2 through interacting with Piasy for transcriptional attenuation.,"Type I IFNs (IFNIs) are involved in the course of antiviral and antimicrobial activities; however, robust inductions of these can lead to host immunopathology. We have reported that the Pias (protein inhibitor of activated signal transducer and activator of transcription) family member, Piasy, possesses the ability to suppress IFNI transcriptions in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), yet the specific molecular mechanism by which it acts remains elusive. Here, we identify that the H3K4me3 levels, one activation mark of genes, in MEFs that were stimulated by poly(I:C) were impaired by Piasy in the IFN-β gene. Piasy bound to the promoter region of the IFN-β gene in MEFs. Meanwhile, retinoblastoma binding protein 2 (Rbp2) was proven to be the only known and novel H3K4me3 demethylase that interacted with Piasy.

28951459,SMYD5 Controls Heterochromatin and Chromosome Integrity during Embryonic Stem Cell Differentiation.,"Epigenetic regulation of chromatin states is thought to control gene expression programs during lineage specification. However, the roles of repressive histone modifications, such as trimethylated histone lysine 20 (H4K20me3), in development and genome stability are largely unknown. Here, we show that depletion of SET and MYND domain-containing protein 5 (SMYD5), which mediates H4K20me3, leads to genome-wide decreases in H4K20me3 and H3K9me3 levels and derepression of endogenous LTR- and LINE-repetitive DNA elements during differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. SMYD5 depletion resulted in chromosomal aberrations and the formation of transformed cells that exhibited decreased H4K20me3 and H3K9me3 levels and an expression signature consistent with multiple human cancers. Moreover, dysregulated gene expression in SMYD5 cancer cells was associated with LTR and endogenous retrovirus elements and decreased H4K20me3. In addition, depletion of SMYD5 in human colon and lung cancer cells results in increased tumor growth and upregulation of genes overexpressed in colon and lung cancers, respectively. These findings implicate an important role for SMYD5 in maintaining chromosome integrity by regulating heterochromatin and repressing endogenous repetitive DNA elements during differentiation.

28946896,Application of dual reading domains as novel reagents in chromatin biology reveals a new H3K9me3 and H3K36me2/3 bivalent chromatin state.,"BACKGROUND: Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) play central roles in chromatin-templated processes. Combinations of two or more histone PTMs form unique interfaces for readout and recruitment of chromatin interacting complexes, but the genome-wide mapping of coexisting histone PTMs remains an experimentally difficult task.
RESULTS: We introduce here a novel type of affinity reagents consisting of two fused recombinant histone modification interacting domains (HiMIDs) for direct detection of doubly modified chromatin. To develop the method, we fused the MPP8 chromodomain and DNMT3A PWWP domain which have a binding specificity for H3K9me3 and H3K36me2/3, respectively. We validate the novel reagent biochemically and in ChIP applications and show its specific interaction with H3K9me3-H3K36me2/3 doubly modified chromatin. Modification specificity was confirmed using mutant double-HiMIDs with inactivated methyllysine binding pockets. Using this novel tool, we mapped coexisting H3K9me3-H3K36me2/3 marks in human cells by chromatin interacting domain precipitation (CIDOP). CIDOP-seq data were validated by qPCR, sequential CIDOP/ChIP and by comparison with CIDOP- and ChIP-seq data obtained with single modification readers and antibodies. The genome-wide distribution of H3K9me3-H3K36me2/3 indicates that it represents a novel bivalent chromatin state, which is enriched in weakly transcribed chromatin segments and at ZNF274 and SetDB1 binding sites.
CONCLUSIONS: The application of double-HiMIDs allows the single-step study of co-occurrence and distribution of combinatorial chromatin marks. Our discovery of a novel H3K9me3-H3K36me2/3 bivalent chromatin state illustrates the power of this approach, and it will stimulate numerous follow-up studies on its biological functions.",Epigenetics Chromatin,2017,"['Mauser R', 'Kungulovski G', 'Keup C', 'Reinhardt R', 'Jeltsch A']"
28945252,Enhancer connectome in primary human cells identifies target genes of disease-associated DNA elements.,"The challenge of linking intergenic mutations to target genes has limited molecular understanding of human diseases. Here we show that H3K27ac HiChIP generates high-resolution contact maps of active enhancers and target genes in rare primary human T cell subtypes and coronary artery smooth muscle cells. Differentiation of naive T cells into T helper 17 cells or regulatory T cells creates subtype-specific enhancer-promoter interactions, specifically at regions of shared DNA accessibility. These data provide a principled means of assigning molecular functions to autoimmune and cardiovascular disease risk variants, linking hundreds of noncoding variants to putative gene targets. Target genes identified with HiChIP are further supported by CRISPR interference and activation at linked enhancers, by the presence of expression quantitative trait loci, and by allele-specific enhancer loops in patient-derived primary cells. The majority of disease-associated enhancers contact genes beyond the nearest gene in the linear genome, leading to a fourfold increase in the number of potential target genes for autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases.",Nat.

28945223,Role of JMJD2B in colon cancer cell survival under glucose-deprived conditions and the underlying mechanisms.,"Metabolic stress is a common phenomenon in solid tumors. Compensatory mechanisms to overcome metabolic stress (glucose deprivation) are vital to tumor cell survival. The histone demethylase Jumonji domain-containing protein 2B (JMJD2B) is vital for the growth and progression of various cancers. However, the role of JMJD2B during glucose deprivation remains unclear. Our aim was to examine the function of JMJD2B in glucose-deprived colon cancer cells and the involvement of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). Our study demonstrated that JMJD2B expression was upregulated via ERK phosphorylation during glucose deprivation. Further, the cell viability assay showed that the effect of p-ERK on the viability of colon cancer cells was at least partly dependent on JMJD2B expression. Glucose deprivation increased interaction between JMJD2B and p-ERK, as demonstrated by the co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence assays. Glucose deprivation also resulted in phosphorylation of JMJD2B by p-ERK, as shown by the immunoprecipitation assay and western blotting analysis. In addition, the phosphorylation of JMJD2B via p-ERK at Thr305, Ser352, Ser566 and Thr1065 contribute to JMJD2B stability. p-ERK stabilizes the JMJD2B protein level by protecting JMJD2B from ubiquitination and proteasome degradation. We found that knockdown of JMJD2B significantly impaired colon cancer cell viability, which is accompanied by a significant reduction in glucose uptake and lactate production. Furthermore, knockdown of JMJD2B after glucose deprivation caused decreased level of GLUT1 through increasing H3K9 tri-methylation levels on its promoter, demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Moreover, targeting JMJD2B in xenograft tumors also decreased the GLUT1 level. Finally, a positive correlation was observed between p-ERK, JMJD2B and GLUT1 expression in 85 human colon cancer tissue specimens. These results indicated that p-ERK-mediated phosphorylation and stabilization of JMJD2B during glucose deprivation contributes to its role in glucose uptake and cell viability, which may be modulated through epigenetically upregulation of GLUT1.",Oncogene,2018,"['Fu LN', 'Wang YQ', 'Tan J', 'Xu J', 'Gao QY', 'Chen YX', 'Fang JY']"
28943310,ASF1a Promotes Non-homologous End Joining Repair by Facilitating Phosphorylation of MDC1 by ATM at Double-Strand Breaks.,"Double-strand breaks (DSBs) of DNA in eukaryotic cells are predominantly repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). The histone chaperone anti-silencing factor 1a (ASF1a) interacts with MDC1 and is recruited to sites of DSBs to facilitate the interaction of phospho-ATM with MDC1 and phosphorylation of MDC1, which are required for the recruitment of RNF8/RNF168 histone ubiquitin ligases. Thus, ASF1a deficiency reduces histone ubiquitination at DSBs, decreasing the recruitment of 53BP1, and decreases NHEJ, rendering cells more sensitive to DSBs. This role of ASF1a in DSB repair cannot be provided by the closely related ASF1b and does not require its histone chaperone activity. Homozygous deletion of ASF1A is seen in 10%-15% of certain cancers, suggesting that loss of NHEJ may be selected in some malignancies and that the deletion can be used as a molecular biomarker for cancers susceptible to radiotherapy or to DSB-inducing chemotherapy.",Mol.

This has revealed that epigenetic dysregulation is a common feature of most pediatric and adult cancers. Many specific and potent inhibitors have been developed for multiple CMP classes, which have assisted in elucidating the role of epigenetics as well as epigenetic vulnerabilities in these cancer types. Clinical trials with numerous CMP inhibitors are also currently in progress to evaluate the therapeutic potential of epigenetic inhibitors. In this review, we aim to provide a summary of genetic mutations in epigenetic genes and a review of CMP inhibitors suitable for preclinical studies or currently in clinical trials.

Favored models have risen and fallen, and healthy debates have swept back and forth. The field has recently reached a critical mass of compelling data that throws light on several previously unresolved issues. The time is ripe for a fruitful combination of these findings with two other long-running avenues of research, namely the biochemical properties of the PcG/TrxG system and the application of theoretical mathematical models toward an understanding of the system's regulatory properties.

28934504,Accumulation of histone variant H3.3 with age is associated with profound changes in the histone methylation landscape.,"Deposition of replication-independent histone variant H3.3 into chromatin is essential for many biological processes, including development and reproduction. Unlike replication-dependent H3.1/2 isoforms, H3.3 is expressed throughout the cell cycle and becomes enriched in postmitotic cells with age. However, lifelong dynamics of H3 variant replacement and the impact of this process on chromatin organization remain largely undefined. Using quantitative middle-down proteomics we demonstrate that H3.3 accumulates to near saturation levels in the chromatin of various mouse somatic tissues by late adulthood. Accumulation of H3.3 is associated with profound changes in global levels of both individual and combinatorial H3 methyl modifications. A subset of these modifications exhibit distinct relative abundances on H3 variants and remain stably enriched on H3.3 throughout the lifespan, suggesting a causal relationship between H3 variant replacement and age-dependent changes in H3 methylation. Furthermore, the H3.3 level is drastically reduced in human hepatocarcinoma cells as compared to nontumoral hepatocytes, suggesting the potential utility of the H3.3 relative abundance as a biomarker of abnormal cell proliferation activity. Overall, our study provides the first quantitative characterization of dynamic changes in H3 proteoforms throughout lifespan in mammals and suggests a role for H3 variant replacement in modulating H3 methylation landscape with age.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2017,"['Tvardovskiy A', 'Schwämmle V', 'Kempf SJ', 'Rogowska-Wrzesinska A', 'Jensen ON']"
28933651,Characterization of H3.3K36M as a tool to study H3K36 methylation in cancer cells.,"Recurrent mutations at key lysine residues in the histone variant H3.3 are thought to play an etiologic role in the development of distinct subsets of pediatric gliomas and bone and cartilage cancers. H3.3K36M is one such mutation that was originally identified in chondroblastomas, and its expression in these tumors contributes to oncogenic reprogramming by triggering global depletion of dimethylation and trimethylation at H3K36 with a concomitant increase in the levels of H3K27 trimethylation. H3.3K36M expression can also cause epigenomic changes in cell types beyond chondrocytic cells. Here we show that expression of H3.3K36M in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cancer cells severely impairs cellular proliferation, which contrasts its role in promoting transformation of chondrocytic cells. H3.3K36M-associated cellular toxicity phenocopies the specific depletion of H3K36me2, but not loss of H3K36me3. We further find that the H3K36me2-associated toxicity is largely independent of changes in H3K27me3. Together, our findings lend support to the argument that H3K36me2 has distinct roles in cancer cells independent of H3K36me3 and H3K27me3, and highlight the use of H3.3K36M as an epigenetic tool to study H3K36 and H3K27 methylation dynamics in diverse cell types.",Epigenetics,2017,"['Sankaran SM', 'Gozani O']"
28930533,53BP1: A guardian for centrosomal integrity.,"53BP1 is known as a mediator in DNA damage response and a regulator of DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) repair. 53BP1 was recently reported to be a centrosomal protein and a binding partner of mitotic polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1). The stability of 53BP1, in response to DSBs, is regulated by its phosphorylation, deubiquitination, and ubiquitination. During mitosis, 53BP1 is stabilized by phosphorylation at S380, a putative binding region with polo-box domain of Plk1, and deubiquitination by ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7). In the absence of DSBs, 53BP1 is abundant in the nucleoplasm; DSB formation results in its rapid localization to the damaged chromatin. Mitotic 53BP1 is also localized at the centrosome and spindle pole. 53BP1 depletion induces mitotic defects such as disorientation of spindle poles attributed to extra centrosomes or mispositioning of centrosomes, leading to phenotypes similar to those in USP7-deficient cells. Here, we discuss how 53BP1 controls the centrosomal integrity through its interaction with USP7 and centromere protein F by regulation of its stability and its physiology in response to DNA damage.",Front Biosci (Landmark Ed),2018,"['Kim H', 'Yim H']"

This mechanism, different from necrosis and apoptosis, is characterized by the release of chromatin webs admixed with microbicidal granular proteins and peptides (NETs). NETs trap and kill a variety of microorganisms. Diverse microorganisms, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, are NET inducers in vitro. The aim of this study was to examine whether M. tuberculosis can also induce NETs in vivo and if the NETs are bactericidal to the microorganism. Guinea pigs were intradermally inoculated with M. tuberculosis H37Rv, and the production of NETs was investigated at several time points thereafter. NETs were detected as early as 30 min post-inoculation and were clearly evident by 4 h post-inoculation. NETs produced in vivo contained DNA, myeloperoxidase, elastase, histones, ROS and acid-fast bacilli. Viable and heat-killed M. tuberculosis, as well as Mycobacterium bovis BCG were efficient NET inducers, as were unilamellar liposomes prepared with lipids from M. tuberculosis. In vitro, guinea pig neutrophils also produced NETs in response to M. tuberculosis. However, neither the in vivo nor the in vitro-produced NETs were able to kill M. tuberculosis.

We provide a focused review of control mechanisms that help modulate the activation and deactivation of gene transcription specifically through histone acetylation writers and readers in cancer. The chemistry of these modifications is subject to clinically actionable targeting, including state-of-the-art strategies to inhibit basic oncogenic mechanisms related to histone acetylation. Although discussed in the context of acute leukemia, the concepts of acetylation writers and readers are not cell-type-specific and are generalizable to other cancers. We review the challenges and resistance mechanisms encountered to date in the development of such therapeutics and postulate how such challenges may be overcome. Because these fundamental cellular mechanisms are dysregulated in cancer biology, continued research and in-depth understanding of histone acetylation reading and writing are desired to further define optimal therapeutic strategies to affect gene activity to target cancer effectively.",Cancer J,2017,"['Benton CB', 'Fiskus W', 'Bhalla KN']"

Loss of modifications on histone N tails, whether due to mutations in genes belonging to histone-modifying complexes or mutations directly affecting the histone tails, causes developmental disorders or has a role in tumorigenesis. More recently, modifications affecting the globular histone core have been uncovered as being crucial for DNA repair, pluripotency and oncogenesis. Here we report monoallelic missense mutations affecting lysine 91 in the histone H4 core (H4K91) in three individuals with a syndrome of growth delay, microcephaly and intellectual disability. Expression of the histone H4 mutants in zebrafish embryos recapitulates the developmental anomalies seen in the patients.

Here, we show that the PHD fingers of PPS and DIDO recognize the histone mark H3K4me3 in a pH-dependent manner: the binding is enhanced at high pH values but is decreased at low pH. Structural analysis reveals that the pH dependency is due to the presence of a histidine residue in the K4me3-binding aromatic cage of PPS. The pH-dependent mechanism is conserved in DIDO but is lost in yeast Bye1. Acidification of cells leads to the accelerated efflux of endogenous DIDO, indicating the pH-dependent sensing of H3K4me3 in vivo. This novel mode for the recognition of H3K4me3 establishes the PHD fingers of PPS and DIDO as unique epigenetic readers and high pH sensors and suggests a role for the histidine switch during mitosis.",Structure,2017,"['Tencer AH', 'Gatchalian J', 'Klein BJ', 'Khan A', 'Zhang Y', 'Strahl BD', 'van Wely KHM', 'Kutateladze TG']"
28916725,Characterization of enhancers and the role of the transcription factor KLF7 in regulating corneal epithelial differentiation.,"During tissue development, transcription factors bind regulatory DNA regions called enhancers, often located at great distances from the genes they regulate, to control gene expression. The enhancer landscape during embryonic stem cell differentiation has been well characterized. By contrast, little is known about the shared and unique enhancer regulatory mechanisms in different ectodermally derived epithelial cells. Here we use ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify domains enriched for the histone marks histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation, histone H3 lysine 4 monomethylation, and histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K4me3, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac) and define, for the first time, the super enhancers and typical enhancers active in primary human corneal epithelial cells. We show that regulatory regions are often shared between cell types of the ectodermal lineage and that corneal epithelial super enhancers are already marked as potential regulatory domains in embryonic stem cells. Kruppel-like factor (KLF) motifs were enriched in corneal epithelial enhancers, consistent with the important roles of KLF4 and KLF5 in promoting corneal epithelial differentiation. We now show that the Kruppel family member KLF7 promotes the corneal progenitor cell state; on many genes, KLF7 antagonized the corneal differentiation-promoting KLF4. Furthermore, we found that two SNPs linked previously to corneal diseases, astigmatism, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome fall within corneal epithelial enhancers and alter their activity by disrupting transcription factor motifs that overlap these SNPs. Taken together, our work defines regulatory enhancers in corneal epithelial cells, highlights global gene-regulatory relationships shared among different epithelial cells, identifies a role for KLF7 as a KLF4 antagonist in corneal epithelial cell differentiation, and explains how two SNPs may contribute to corneal diseases.",J.

28916515,Reversing thyroid-hormone-mediated repression of a HSV-1 promoter via computationally guided mutagenesis.,Thyroid hormones (THs) and their DNA-binding nuclear receptors (TRs) direct transcriptional regulation in diverse ways depending on the host cell environment and specific promoter characteristics of TH-sensitive genes. This study sought to elucidate the impact on transcriptional repression of nucleotide sequence or orientation within TR binding sites - the TH response elements (TREs) of TH-sensitive promoters - to better understand ligand-dependent transcriptional repression of wild-type promoters. Computational analysis of the HSV-1 thymidine kinase (TK) gene TRE bound by TR and retinoid X receptor (RXR) revealed a single TRE point mutation sufficient to reverse the TRE orientation. ,J. Cell.

28914798,Genome Instability and γH2AX.,"γH2AX has emerged in the last 20 years as a central player in the DDR (DNA damage response), with specificity for DSBs (double-strand breaks). Upon the generation of DSBs, γ-phosphorylation extends along megabase-long domains in chromatin, both sides of the damage. The significance of this mechanism is of great importance; it depicts a biological amplification mechanism where one DSB induces the γ-phosphorylation of thousands of H2AX molecules along megabaselong domains of chromatin, that are adjusted to the sites of DSBs. A sequential recruitment of signal transduction factors that interact to each other and become activated to further amplify the signal that will travel to the cytoplasm take place on the γ-phosphorylated chromatin. γ-phosphorylation is an early event in the DSB damage response, induced in all phases of the cell cycle, and participates in both DSB repair pathways, the HR (homologous recombination) and NHEJ (non-homologous end joining). Today, numerous studies support the notion that γH2AX functions as a guardian of the genome by preventing misrepaired DSB that increase the mutation load of the cells and may further lead to genome instability and carcinogenesis.",Int J Mol Sci,2017,"['Georgoulis A', 'Vorgias CE', 'Chrousos GP', 'Rogakou EP']"
28911980,Chromatin organization as an indicator of glucocorticoid induced natural killer cell dysfunction.,"It is well-established that psychological distress reduces natural killer cell immune function and that this reduction can be due to the stress-induced release of glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids are known to alter epigenetic marks associated with immune effector loci, and are also known to influence chromatin organization. The purpose of this investigation was to assess the effect of glucocorticoids on natural killer cell chromatin organization and to determine the relationship of chromatin organization to natural killer cell effector function, e.g. interferon gamma production. Interferon gamma production is the prototypic cytokine produced by natural killer cells and is known to modulate both innate and adaptive immunity. Glucocorticoid treatment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells resulted in a significant reduction in interferon gamma production. Glucocorticoid treatment also resulted in a demonstrable natural killer cell nuclear phenotype. This phenotype was localization of the histone, post-translational epigenetic mark, H3K27me3, to the nuclear periphery. Peripheral nuclear localization of H3K27me3 was directly related to cellular levels of interferon gamma. This nuclear phenotype was determined by direct visual inspection and by use of an automated, high through-put technology, the Amnis ImageStream. This technology combines the per-cell information content provided by standard microscopy with the statistical significance afforded by large sample sizes common to standard flow cytometry. Most importantly, this technology provides for a direct assessment of the localization of signal intensity within individual cells. The results demonstrate glucocorticoids to dysregulate natural killer cell function at least in part through altered H3K27me3 nuclear organization and demonstrate H3K27me3 chromatin organization to be a predictive indicator of glucocorticoid induced immune dysregulation of natural killer cells.",Brain Behav.

28910569,Hierarchical recruitment of Polycomb complexes revisited.,"Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins epigenetically repress key developmental genes and thereby control alternative cell fates. PcG proteins act as complexes that can modify histones and these histone modifications play a role in transmitting the ""memory"" of the repressed state as cells divide. Here we consider mainstream models that link histone modifications to hierarchical recruitment of PcG complexes and compare them to results of a direct test of interdependence between PcG complexes for recruitment to Drosophila genes. The direct test indicates that PcG complexes do not rely on histone modifications to recognize their target genes but use them to stabilize the interactions within large chromatin domains. It also shows that multiple strategies are used to coordinate the targeting of PcG complexes to different genes, which may make the repression of these genes more or less robust.",Nucleus,2017,"['Dorafshan E', 'Kahn TG', 'Schwartz YB']"
28910568,Network of phosphatases and HDAC complexes at repressed chromatin.,"Tight regulation of gene expression is achieved by a variety of protein complexes that selectively bind chromatin, modify it and change its transcription competency. Histone acetylases (HATs) and deacetylases (HDACs) play an important role in this process. They can generate transcriptionally active or inactive chromatin through the addition (HATs) or removal (HDACs) of acetyl groups on histones, respectively. Repo-Man is a Protein Phosphatase 1 targeting subunit that accumulates on chromosomes during mitotic exit and mediates the removal of mitotic histone H3 phosphorylations. It was shown recently that Repo-Man also regulates heterochromatin formation in interphase and that its depletion favours the switch between transcriptionally inactive and active chromatin, demonstrating that its role goes well beyond mitosis. Here, we provide the first link between a phosphatase and HDAC complexes. We show that genome-wide Repo-Man binding sites overlap with chromatin regions bound by members of the three HDAC complexes (Sin3a, NuRD and CoREST). We establish that members of the NuRD and Sin3a HDAC complexes interact with Repo-Man by mass spectrometry and that Repo-Man is in close proximity to SAP18 (Sin3a) in interphase as observed by the Proximity Ligation Assay. Altogether, these data suggest a mechanism by which Repo-Man/PP1 complex, via interactions with HDACs, could stabilise gene repression.",Cell Cycle,2017,"['de Castro IJ', 'Amin HA', 'Vinciotti V', 'Vagnarelli P']"
28903997,Mitotic post-translational modifications of histones promote chromatin compaction in vitro.,"How eukaryotic chromosomes are compacted during mitosis has been a leading question in cell biology since the nineteenth century. Non-histone proteins such as condensin complexes contribute to chromosome shaping, but appear not to be necessary for mitotic chromatin compaction. Histone modifications are known to affect chromatin structure. As histones undergo major changes in their post-translational modifications during mitotic entry, we speculated that the spectrum of cell-cycle-specific histone modifications might contribute to chromosome compaction during mitosis. To test this hypothesis, we isolated core histones from interphase and mitotic cells and reconstituted chromatin with them. We used mass spectrometry to show that key post-translational modifications remained intact during our isolation procedure. Light, atomic force and transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that chromatin assembled from mitotic histones has a much greater tendency to aggregate than chromatin assembled from interphase histones, even under low magnesium conditions where interphase chromatin remains as separate beads-on-a-string structures. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that mitotic chromosome formation is a two-stage process with changes in the spectrum of histone post-translational modifications driving mitotic chromatin compaction, while the action of non-histone proteins such as condensin may then shape the condensed chromosomes into their classic mitotic morphology.",Open Biol,2017,"['Zhiteneva A', 'Bonfiglio JJ', 'Makarov A', 'Colby T', 'Vagnarelli P', 'Schirmer EC', 'Matic I', 'Earnshaw WC']"

Histone lysine methyltransferase contributes to the establishment and maintenance of differential histone methylation status, which can recognize histone methylated sites and build an association between these modifications and their downstream processes. Recently, it was found that abnormalities in the histone lysine methylation level or pattern may lead to the occurrence of many types of cardiovascular diseases, such as congenital heart disease (CHD).

28894274,KDM4A regulates HIF-1 levels through H3K9me3.,"Regions of hypoxia (low oxygen) occur in most solid tumours and cells in these areas are the most aggressive and therapy resistant. In response to decreased oxygen, extensive changes in gene expression mediated by Hypoxia-Inducible Factors (HIFs) contribute significantly to the aggressive hypoxic tumour phenotype. In addition to HIFs, multiple histone demethylases are altered in their expression and activity, providing a secondary mechanism to extend the hypoxic signalling response. In this study, we demonstrate that the levels of HIF-1α are directly controlled by the repressive chromatin mark, H3K9me3. In conditions where the histone demethylase KDM4A is depleted or inactive, H3K9me3 accumulates at the HIF-1α locus, leading to a decrease in HIF-1α mRNA and a reduction in HIF-1α stabilisation. Loss of KDM4A in hypoxic conditions leads to a decreased HIF-1α mediated transcriptional response and correlates with a reduction in the characteristics associated with tumour aggressiveness, including invasion, migration, and oxygen consumption. The contribution of KDM4A to the regulation of HIF-1α is most robust in conditions of mild hypoxia. This suggests that KDM4A can enhance the function of HIF-1α by increasing the total available protein to counteract any residual activity of prolyl hydroxylases.",Sci Rep,2017,"['Dobrynin G', 'McAllister TE', 'Leszczynska KB', 'Ramachandran S', 'Krieg AJ', 'Kawamura A', 'Hammond EM']"
28892740,Human OGG1 activity in nucleosomes is facilitated by transient unwrapping of DNA and is influenced by the local histone environment.,"If unrepaired, damage to genomic DNA can cause mutations and/or be cytotoxic. Single base lesions are repaired via the base excision repair (BER) pathway. The first step in BER is the recognition and removal of the nucleobase lesion by a glycosylase enzyme. For example, human oxoguanine glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) is responsible for removal of the prototypic oxidatively damaged nucleobase, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG). To date, most studies of glycosylases have used free duplex DNA substrates. However, cellular DNA is packaged as repeating nucleosome units, with 145 base pair segments of DNA wrapped around histone protein octamers. Previous studies revealed inhibition of hOGG1 at the nucleosome dyad axis and in the absence of chromatin remodelers. In this study, we reveal that even in the absence of chromatin remodelers or external cofactors, hOGG1 can initiate BER at positions off the dyad axis and that this activity is facilitated by spontaneous and transient unwrapping of DNA from the histones. Additionally, we find that solution accessibility as determined by hydroxyl radical footprinting is not fully predictive of glycosylase activity and that histone tails can suppress hOGG1 activity. We therefore suggest that local nuances in the nucleosome environment and histone-DNA interactions can impact glycosylase activity.",DNA Repair (Amst.),2017,"['Bilotti K', 'Kennedy EE', 'Li C', 'Delaney S']"
28887637,Epigenetic regulation in cell senescence.,"Cell senescence, which is an irreversible state of cell proliferative arrest, has emerged as a potentially important contributor to tissue dysfunction and organismal ageing. Cell senescence is triggered by a variety of senescence stressors, which affect gene expression and multiple signalling pathways that give rise to various senescence phenotypes. Epigenetic mechanisms, as critical regulators of chromosomal architecture and gene expression, have added an extra dimension to the molecular mechanisms of cell senescence. Cell senescence is accompanied by changes in DNA methylation, histone-associated epigenetic processes, chromatin remodelling and ncRNA expression. Those senescence-associated epigenetic alterations interact with the senescence regulatory programme networks and lead to various cell senescence phenotypes. This review provides a comprehensive overview of epigenetic changes and their effects on cell senescence. The differences in epigenetic alterations among different types of senescence are also discussed. Furthermore, we summarise the interactions among different epigenetic mechanisms during cell senescence and analyse the possibility of using epigenetic signatures as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the treatment of senescence-associated diseases.",J.

Together with the Sox1/SOX1 and Sox2/SOX2 genes it is implicated in the regulation of stem cell identity. In the present study, we performed the first analysis of epigenetic mechanisms (DNA methylation and histone marks) involved in the regulation of the human SOX3 gene expression during RA-induced neural differentiation of NT2/D1 cells. We show that the promoter of the human SOX3 gene is extremely hypomethylated both in undifferentiated NT2/D1 cells and during the early phases of RA-induced neural differentiation. By employing chromatin immunoprecipitation, we analyze several histone modifications across different regions of the SOX3 gene and their dynamics following initiation of differentiation. In the same timeframe we investigate profiles of selected histone marks on the promoters of human SOX1 and SOX2 genes. We demonstrate differences in histone signatures of SOX1, SOX2 and SOX3 genes. Considering the importance of SOXB1 genes in the process of neural differentiation, the present study contributes to a better understanding of epigenetic mechanisms implicated in the regulation of pluripotency maintenance and commitment towards the neural lineage.",PLoS ONE,2017,"['Topalovic V', 'Krstic A', 'Schwirtlich M', 'Dolfini D', 'Mantovani R', 'Stevanovic M', 'Mojsin M']"

28877467,The SET1 Complex Selects Actively Transcribed Target Genes via Multivalent Interaction with CpG Island Chromatin.,"Chromatin modifications and the promoter-associated epigenome are important for the regulation of gene expression. However, the mechanisms by which chromatin-modifying complexes are targeted to the appropriate gene promoters in vertebrates and how they influence gene expression have remained poorly defined. Here, using a combination of live-cell imaging and functional genomics, we discover that the vertebrate SET1 complex is targeted to actively transcribed gene promoters through CFP1, which engages in a form of multivalent chromatin reading that involves recognition of non-methylated DNA and histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3). CFP1 defines SET1 complex occupancy on chromatin, and its multivalent interactions are required for the SET1 complex to place H3K4me3. In the absence of CFP1, gene expression is perturbed, suggesting that normal targeting and function of the SET1 complex are central to creating an appropriately functioning vertebrate promoter-associated epigenome.",Cell Rep,2017,"['Brown DA', 'Di Cerbo V', 'Feldmann A', 'Ahn J', 'Ito S', 'Blackledge NP', 'Nakayama M', 'McClellan M', 'Dimitrova E', 'Turberfield AH', 'Long HK', 'King HW', 'Kriaucionis S', 'Schermelleh L', 'Kutateladze TG', 'Koseki H', 'Klose RJ']"
28871137,C-terminal BRE overexpression in 11q23-rearranged and t(8;16) acute myeloid leukemia is caused by intragenic transcription initiation.,"Overexpression of the BRE (brain and reproductive organ-expressed) gene defines a distinct pediatric and adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) subgroup. Here we identify a promoter enriched for active chromatin marks in BRE intron 4 causing strong biallelic expression of a previously unknown C-terminal BRE transcript. This transcript starts with BRE intron 4 sequences spliced to exon 5 and downstream sequences, and if translated might code for an N terminally truncated BRE protein. Remarkably, the new BRE transcript was highly expressed in over 50% of 11q23/KMT2A (lysine methyl transferase 2A)-rearranged and t(8;16)/KAT6A-CREBBP cases, while it was virtually absent from other AML subsets and normal tissues. In gene reporter assays, the leukemia-specific fusion protein KMT2A-MLLT3 transactivated the intragenic BRE promoter. Further epigenome analyses revealed 97 additional intragenic promoter marks frequently bound by KMT2A in AML with C-terminal BRE expression. The corresponding genes may be part of a context-dependent KMT2A-MLLT3-driven oncogenic program, because they were higher expressed in this AML subtype compared with other groups. C-terminal BRE might be an important contributor to this program because in a case with relapsed AML, we observed an ins(11;2) fusing CHORDC1 to BRE at the region where intragenic transcription starts in KMT2A-rearranged and KAT6A-CREBBP AML.",Leukemia,2018,"['Marneth AE', 'Prange KHM', 'Al Hinai ASA', 'Bergevoet SM', 'Tesi N', 'Janssen-Megens EM', 'Kim B', 'Sharifi N', 'Yaspo ML', 'Kuster J', 'Sanders MA', 'Stoetman ECG', 'Knijnenburg J', 'Arentsen-Peters TCJM', 'Zwaan CM', 'Stunnenberg HG', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Haferlach T', 'Fornerod M', 'Jansen JH', 'Valk PJM', 'van der Reijden BA', 'Martens JHA']"
28869966,Polycomb-like proteins link the PRC2 complex to CpG islands.,"The Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) mainly mediates transcriptional repression and has essential roles in various biological processes including the maintenance of cell identity and proper differentiation. Polycomb-like (PCL) proteins, such as PHF1, MTF2 and PHF19, are PRC2-associated factors that form sub-complexes with PRC2 core components, and have been proposed to modulate the enzymatic activity of PRC2 or the recruitment of PRC2 to specific genomic loci. Mammalian PRC2-binding sites are enriched in CG content, which correlates with CpG islands that display a low level of DNA methylation. However, the mechanism of PRC2 recruitment to CpG islands is not fully understood. Here we solve the crystal structures of the N-terminal domains of PHF1 and MTF2 with bound CpG-containing DNAs in the presence of H3K36me3-containing histone peptides. We show that the extended homologous regions of both proteins fold into a winged-helix structure, which specifically binds to the unmethylated CpG motif but in a completely different manner from the canonical winged-helix DNA recognition motif. We also show that the PCL extended homologous domains are required for efficient recruitment of PRC2 to CpG island-containing promoters in mouse embryonic stem cells. Our research provides the first, to our knowledge, direct evidence to demonstrate that PCL proteins are crucial for PRC2 recruitment to CpG islands, and further clarifies the roles of these proteins in transcriptional regulation in vivo.",Nature,2017,"['Li H', 'Liefke R', 'Jiang J', 'Kurland JV', 'Tian W', 'Deng P', 'Zhang W', 'He Q', 'Patel DJ', 'Bulyk ML', 'Shi Y', 'Wang Z']"

28865451,Genome-wide computational analysis of potential long noncoding RNA mediated DNA:DNA:RNA triplexes in the human genome.,"BACKGROUND: Only a handful of long noncoding RNAs have been functionally characterized. They are known to modulate regulation through interacting with other biomolecules in the cell: DNA, RNA and protein. Though there have been detailed investigations on lncRNA-miRNA and lncRNA-protein interactions, the interaction of lncRNAs with DNA have not been studied extensively. In the present study, we explore whether lncRNAs could modulate genomic regulation by interacting with DNA through the formation of highly stable DNA:DNA:RNA triplexes.
METHODS: We computationally screened 23,898 lncRNA transcripts as annotated by GENCODE, across the human genome for potential triplex forming sequence stretches (PTS). The PTS frequencies were compared across 5'UTR, CDS, 3'UTR, introns, promoter and 1000 bases downstream of the transcription termination sites. These regions were annotated by mapping to experimental regulatory regions, classes of repeat regions and transcription factors. We validated few putative triplex mediated interactions where lncRNA-gene pair interaction is via pyrimidine triplex motif using biophysical methods.
RESULTS: We identified 20,04,034 PTS sites to be enriched in promoter and intronic regions across human genome. Additional analysis of the association of PTS with core promoter elements revealed a systematic paucity of PTS in all regulatory regions, except TF binding sites. A total of 25 transcription factors were found to be associated with PTS. Using an interaction network, we showed that a subset of the triplex forming lncRNAs, have a positive association with gene promoters. We also demonstrated an in vitro interaction of one lncRNA candidate with its predicted gene target promoter regions.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis shows that PTS are enriched in gene promoter and largely associated with simple repeats. The current study suggests a major role of a subset of lncRNAs in mediating chromatin organization modulation through CTCF and NSRF proteins.",J Transl Med,2017,"['Jalali S', 'Singh A', 'Maiti S', 'Scaria V']"
28864822,Hepcidin is regulated by promoter-associated histone acetylation and HDAC3.,"Hepcidin regulates systemic iron homeostasis. Suppression of hepcidin expression occurs physiologically in iron deficiency and increased erythropoiesis but is pathologic in thalassemia and hemochromatosis. Here we show that epigenetic events govern hepcidin expression. Erythropoiesis and iron deficiency suppress hepcidin via erythroferrone-dependent and -independent mechanisms, respectively, in vivo, but both involve reversible loss of H3K9ac and H3K4me3 at the hepcidin locus. In vitro, pan-histone deacetylase inhibition elevates hepcidin expression, and in vivo maintains H3K9ac at hepcidin-associated chromatin and abrogates hepcidin suppression by erythropoietin, iron deficiency, thalassemia, and hemochromatosis. Histone deacetylase 3 and its cofactor NCOR1 regulate hepcidin; histone deacetylase 3 binds chromatin at the hepcidin locus, and histone deacetylase 3 knockdown counteracts hepcidin suppression induced either by erythroferrone or by inhibiting bone morphogenetic protein signaling. In iron deficient mice, the histone deacetylase 3 inhibitor RGFP966 increases hepcidin, and RNA sequencing confirms hepcidin is one of the genes most differentially regulated by this drug in vivo. We conclude that suppression of hepcidin expression involves epigenetic regulation by histone deacetylase 3.Hepcidin controls systemic iron levels by inhibiting intestinal iron absorption and iron recycling.

28855512,ATRX is a regulator of therapy induced senescence in human cells.,"Senescence is a state of stable cell cycle exit with important implications for development and disease. Here, we demonstrate that the chromatin remodeling enzyme ATRX is required for therapy-induced senescence. ATRX accumulates in nuclear foci and is required for therapy-induced senescence in multiple types of transformed cells exposed to either DNA damaging agents or CDK4 inhibitors. Mobilization into foci depends on the ability of ATRX to interact with H3K9me3 histone and HP1. Foci form soon after cells exit the cell cycle, before other hallmarks of senescence appear. Eliminating ATRX in senescent cells destabilizes the senescence-associated heterochromatic foci. Additionally, ATRX binds to and suppresses expression from the HRAS locus; repression of HRAS is sufficient to promote the transition of quiescent cells into senescence and preventing repression blocks progression into senescence. Thus ATRX is a critical regulator of therapy-induced senescence and acts in multiple ways to drive cells into this state.Therapy induced senescence (TIS) is a growth suppressive program activated by cytostatic agents in some cancer cells. Here the authors show that the chromatin remodeling enzyme ATRX is a regulator of TIS and drives cells into this state via multiple mechanisms.",Nat Commun,2017,"['Kovatcheva M', 'Liao W', 'Klein ME', 'Robine N', 'Geiger H', 'Crago AM', 'Dickson MA', 'Tap WD', 'Singer S', 'Koff A']"
28855511,Blood monocyte transcriptome and epigenome analyses reveal loci associated with human atherosclerosis.,"Little is known regarding the epigenetic basis of atherosclerosis. Here we present the CD14+ blood monocyte transcriptome and epigenome signatures associated with human atherosclerosis. The transcriptome signature includes transcription coactivator, ARID5B, which is known to form a chromatin derepressor complex with a histone H3K9Me2-specific demethylase and promote adipogenesis and smooth muscle development. ARID5B CpG (cg25953130) methylation is inversely associated with both ARID5B expression and atherosclerosis, consistent with this CpG residing in an ARID5B enhancer region, based on chromatin capture and histone marks data. Mediation analysis supports assumptions that ARID5B expression mediates effects of cg25953130 methylation and several cardiovascular disease risk factors on atherosclerotic burden. In lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human THP1 monocytes, ARID5B knockdown reduced expression of genes involved in atherosclerosis-related inflammatory and lipid metabolism pathways, and inhibited cell migration and phagocytosis. These data suggest that ARID5B expression, possibly regulated by an epigenetically controlled enhancer, promotes atherosclerosis by dysregulating immunometabolism towards a chronic inflammatory phenotype.The molecular mechanisms mediating the impact of environmental factors in atherosclerosis are unclear.

Histone H2AK119 ubiquitination (H2Aub) is a prevalent modification and has been primarily linked to gene silencing. However, the underlying mechanism remains largely obscure. Here we report the identification of RSF1 (remodeling and spacing factor 1), a subunit of the RSF complex, as a H2Aub binding protein, which mediates the gene-silencing function of this histone modification. RSF1 associates specifically with H2Aub, but not H2Bub nucleosomes, through a previously uncharacterized and obligatory region designated as ubiquitinated H2A binding domain. In human and mouse cells, genes regulated by RSF1 overlap significantly with those controlled by RNF2/Ring1B, the subunit of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) which catalyzes the ubiquitination of H2AK119.

28847821,The tale of a tail: histone H4 acetylation and the repair of DNA breaks.,"The ability of cells to detect and repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) within the complex architecture of the genome requires co-ordination between the DNA repair machinery and chromatin remodelling complexes. This co-ordination is essential to process damaged chromatin and create open chromatin structures which are required for repair. Initially, there is a PARP-dependent recruitment of repressors, including HP1 and several H3K9 methyltransferases, and exchange of histone H2A.Z by the NuA4-Tip60 complex. This creates repressive chromatin at the DSB in which the tail of histone H4 is bound to the acidic patch on the nucleosome surface. These repressor complexes are then removed, allowing rapid acetylation of the H4 tail by Tip60. H4 acetylation blocks interaction between the H4 tail and the acidic patch on adjacent nucleosomes, decreasing inter-nucleosomal interactions and creating open chromatin. Further, the H4 tail is now free to recruit proteins such as 53BP1 to DSBs, a process modulated by H4 acetylation, and provides binding sites for bromodomain proteins, including ZMYND8 and BRD4, which are important for DSB repair. Here, we will discuss how the H4 tail functions as a dynamic hub that can be programmed through acetylation to alter chromatin packing and recruit repair proteins to the break site.This article is part of the themed issue 'Chromatin modifiers and remodellers in DNA repair and signalling'.","Philos.

Here we show that ectopic expression of Gene 33 triggers DDR in an ATM serine/threonine kinase (ATM)-dependent fashion and through pathways dependent or not dependent on ABL proto-oncogene 1 non-receptor tyrosine kinase (c-Abl). We observed the clear presence of Gene 33 in the nucleus and chromatin fractions of the cell. We also found that the nuclear localization of Gene 33 is regulated by its 14-3-3-binding domain and that the chromatin localization of Gene 33 is partially dependent on its ErbB-binding domain. Our data further indicated that Gene 33 may regulate the targeting of c-Abl to chromatin. Moreover, we observed a clear association of Gene 33 with histone H2AX and that ectopic expression of Gene 33 promotes the interaction between ATM and histone H2AX without triggering DNA damage. In summary, our results reveal nuclear functions of Gene 33 that regulate DDR. The nuclear localization of Gene 33 also provides a spatial explanation of the previously reported regulation of apoptosis by Gene 33 via the c-Abl/p73 pathway. On the basis of these findings and our previous studies, we propose that Gene 33 is a proximal regulator of DDR that promotes DNA repair.",J. Biol.

28835378,Density imaging of heterochromatin in live cells using orientation-independent-DIC microscopy.,"In eukaryotic cells, highly condensed inactive/silenced chromatin has long been called ""heterochromatin."" However, recent research suggests that such regions are in fact not fully transcriptionally silent and that there exists only a moderate access barrier to heterochromatin. To further investigate this issue, it is critical to elucidate the physical properties of heterochromatin such as its total density in live cells. Here, using orientation-independent differential interference contrast (OI-DIC) microscopy, which is capable of mapping optical path differences, we investigated the density of the total materials in pericentric foci, a representative heterochromatin model, in live mouse NIH3T3 cells. We demonstrated that the total density of heterochromatin (208 mg/ml) was only 1.53-fold higher than that of the surrounding euchromatic regions (136 mg/ml) while the DNA density of heterochromatin was 5.5- to 7.5-fold higher. We observed similar minor differences in density in typical facultative heterochromatin, the inactive human X chromosomes. This surprisingly small difference may be due to that nonnucleosomal materials (proteins/RNAs) (∼120 mg/ml) are dominant in both chromatin regions. Monte Carlo simulation suggested that nonnucleosomal materials contribute to creating a moderate access barrier to heterochromatin, allowing minimal protein access to functional regions. Our OI-DIC imaging offers new insight into the live cellular environments.",Mol. Biol.

28834260,RFTS-dependent negative regulation of Dnmt1 by nucleosome structure and histone tails.,"DNA methylation in promoter regions represses gene expression and is copied over mitotic divisions by Dnmt1. Dnmt1 activity is regulated by its replication foci targeting sequence (RFTS) domain which masks the catalytic pocket. It has been shown that Dnmt1 activity on unmethylated DNA is inhibited in nucleosome cores. In the present study, we aimed to assess the effect of nuclesome formation on maintenance methylation at single CpG resolution. We show that Dnmt1 fully methylates naked linker DNA in dinucleosomes, whereas maintenance methylation was repressed at all CpG sites in nucleosome core particles. Deletion of RFTS partly released obstruction of Dnmt1 activity in core particles. Histone H3 tail peptides inhibited Dnmt1 in an RFTS-dependent manner and repression was modulated by acetylation or methylation. We propose a novel function of RFTS to regulate Dnmt1 activity in nucleosomes.",FEBS J.,2017,"['Mishima Y', 'Brueckner L', 'Takahashi S', 'Kawakami T', 'Arita K', 'Oka S', 'Otani J', 'Hojo H', 'Shirakawa M', 'Shinohara A', 'Watanabe M', 'Suetake I']"
28830512,Histone 4 lysine 8 acetylation regulates proliferation and host-pathogen interaction in Plasmodium falciparum.,"BACKGROUND: The dynamics of histone modifications in Plasmodium falciparum indicates the existence of unique mechanisms that link epigenetic factors with transcription. Here, we studied the impact of acetylated histone code on transcriptional regulation during the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC) of P. falciparum.
RESULTS: Using a dominant-negative transgenic approach, we showed that acetylations of histone H4 play a direct role in transcription. Specifically, these histone modifications mediate an inverse transcriptional relationship between the factors of cell proliferation and host-parasite interaction. Out of the four H4 acetylations, H4K8ac is likely the rate-limiting, regulatory step, which modulates the overall dynamics of H4 posttranslational modifications. H4K8ac exhibits maximum responsiveness to HDAC inhibitors and has a highly dynamic distribution pattern along the genome of P. falciparum during the IDC. Moreover, H4K8ac functions mainly in the euchromatin where its occupancy shifts from intergenic regions located upstream of 5' end of open reading frame into the protein coding regions. This shift is directly or indirectly associated with transcriptional activities at the corresponding genes. H4K8ac is also active in the heterochromatin where it stimulates expression of the main antigenic gene family (var) by its presence in the promoter region.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we demonstrate that H4K8ac is a potential major regulator of chromatin-linked transcriptional changes during P. falciparum life cycle which is associated not only with euchromatin but also with heterochromatin environment. This is potentially a highly significant finding that suggests a regulatory connection between growth and parasite-host interaction both of which play a major role in malaria parasite virulence.",Epigenetics Chromatin,2017,"['Gupta AP', 'Zhu L', 'Tripathi J', 'Kucharski M', 'Patra A', 'Bozdech Z']"
28826674,Evolutionarily Conserved Principles Predict 3D Chromatin Organization.,"Topologically associating domains (TADs), CTCF loop domains, and A/B compartments have been identified as important structural and functional components of 3D chromatin organization, yet the relationship between these features is not well understood. Using high-resolution Hi-C and HiChIP, we show that Drosophila chromatin is organized into domains we term compartmental domains that correspond precisely with A/B compartments at high resolution. We find that transcriptional state is a major predictor of Hi-C contact maps in several eukaryotes tested, including C. elegans and A. thaliana. Architectural proteins insulate compartmental domains by reducing interaction frequencies between neighboring regions in Drosophila, but CTCF loops do not play a distinct role in this organism. In mammals, compartmental domains exist alongside CTCF loop domains to form topological domains. The results suggest that compartmental domains are responsible for domain structure in all eukaryotes, with CTCF playing an important role in domain formation in mammals.",Mol.

During this process, the mRNA molecule synthesized by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) undergoes extensive maturation, folding and packaging events that are intimately coupled to its synthesis. All these events take place in a chromatin context and it is therefore not surprising that a growing number of studies recently reported specific contributions of chromatin dynamics to various steps of mRNP biogenesis.

28815970,Structural insight into the recognition of acetylated histone H3K56ac mediated by the bromodomain of CREB-binding protein.,"None: The acetylation of lysine 56 of histone H3 (H3K56ac) enhances the binding affinity of histone chaperones to H3-H4 dimers. CREB-binding protein (CBP) possesses a bromodomain that recognizes H3K56 acetylation. CBP also possesses a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain, which has been shown to promote H3K56 acetylation of free histones to facilitate delivery of replication-dependent chaperones to acetylated histones for chromatin assembly. However, the mechanism by which the CBP bromodomain recognizes H3K56ac and the context in which such recognition occurs remain elusive. Here, we solved the crystal structure of the CBP bromodomain in complex with an H3K56ac peptide. Our data demonstrate that the CBP bromodomain recognizes H3K56ac with high affinity. Structural and affinity analyses reveal that the CBP bromodomain prefers an aromatic residue at the -2 position and an arginine at the -4 position from the acetyl-lysine, and that the CBP bromodomain selectively recognizes an extended conformation of the H3 αN helix that contains H3K56ac. We also demonstrate that the CBP bromodomain binds to H3K56ac in a recombinant H3-H4 dimer but not in a mono-nucleosome. Our results suggest that the CBP bromodomain selectively recognizes an extended conformation of the K56-acetylated H3 α

We used an integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic approach to analyze chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, transcription-factor binding, and gene expression in IFN-γ-primed human macrophages. IFN-γ suppressed basal expression of genes corresponding to an ""M2""-like homeostatic and reparative phenotype. IFN-γ repressed genes by suppressing the function of enhancers enriched for binding by transcription factor MAF. Mechanistically, IFN-γ disassembled a subset of enhancers by inducing coordinate suppression of binding by MAF, lineage-determining transcription factors, and chromatin accessibility. Genes associated with MAF-binding enhancers were suppressed in macrophages isolated from rheumatoid-arthritis patients, revealing a disease-associated signature of IFN-γ-mediated repression. These results identify enhancer inactivation and disassembly as a mechanism of IFN-γ-mediated gene repression and reveal that MAF regulates the macrophage enhancer landscape and is suppressed by IFN-γ to augment macrophage activation.",Immunity,2017,"['Kang K', 'Park SH', 'Chen J', 'Qiao Y', 'Giannopoulou E', 'Berg K', 'Hanidu A', 'Li J', 'Nabozny G', 'Kang K', 'Park-Min KH', 'Ivashkiv LB']"

Here, we demonstrate that LSD1 regulates vitamin D receptor (VDR) activity and is a mediator of 1,25(OH)
METHODS: Athymic nude mice were xenografted with CWR22 cells and monitored weekly after testosterone pellet removal. Expression of LSD1 and VDR (IHC) were correlated with tumor growth using log-rank test. TRAMP tumors and prostates from wild-type (WT) mice were used to evaluate VDR and LSD1 expression via IHC and western blotting. The presence of VDR and LSD1 in the same transcriptional complex was evaluated via immunoprecipitation (IP) using nuclear cell lysate. The effect of LSD1 and 1,25(OH)
RESULTS: LSD1 and VDR protein levels are elevated in PCa tumors and correlate with faster tumor growth in xenograft mouse models. Knockdown of LSD1 reduces PCa cell viability, and gene expression data suggest a dual coregulatory role of LSD1 for VDR, acting as a coactivator and corepressor in a locus-specific manner. LSD1 modulates VDR-dependent transcription by mediating the recruitment of VDR and DNMT1 at the TSS of VDR-targeted genes and modulates the epigenetic status of transcribed genes by altering H3K4me2 and H3K9Ac and DNA methylation. Lastly, LSD1 and DNMT1 belong to a genome-wide signature whose expression correlates with shorter progression-free survival and overall survival in primary and metastatic patients' samples, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate that LSD1 has a dual coregulatory role as corepressor and coactivator for VDR and defines a genomic signature whose targeting might have clinical relevance for PCa patients.",Clin Epigenetics,2017,"['Battaglia S', 'Karasik E', 'Gillard B', 'Williams J', 'Winchester T', 'Moser MT', 'Smiraglia DJ', 'Foster BA']"

28808080,Characterization of the human thyroid epigenome.,"The thyroid gland, necessary for normal human growth and development, functions as an essential regulator of metabolism by the production and secretion of appropriate levels of thyroid hormone. However, assessment of abnormal thyroid function may be challenging suggesting a more fundamental understanding of normal function is needed. One way to characterize normal gland function is to study the epigenome and resulting transcriptome within its constituent cells. This study generates the first published reference epigenomes for human thyroid from four individuals using ChIP-seq and RNA-seq. We profiled six histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K36me3, H3K9me3, H3K27me3), identified chromatin states using a hidden Markov model, produced a novel quantitative metric for model selection and established epigenomic maps of 19 chromatin states. We found that epigenetic features characterizing promoters and transcription elongation tend to be more consistent than regions characterizing enhancers or Polycomb-repressed regions and that epigenetically active genes consistent across all epigenomes tend to have higher expression than those not marked as epigenetically active in all epigenomes. We also identified a set of 18 genes epigenetically active and consistently expressed in the thyroid that are likely highly relevant to thyroid function. Altogether, these epigenomes represent a powerful resource to develop a deeper understanding of the underlying molecular biology of thyroid function and provide contextual information of thyroid and human epigenomic data for comparison and integration into future studies.",J.

To address this, genome-wide promoter capture Hi-C (CHi-C) was performed during epidermal differentiation. Two classes of enhancer-promoter contacts associated with differentiation-induced genes were identified. The first class ('gained') increased in contact strength during differentiation in concert with enhancer acquisition of the H3K27ac activation mark. The second class ('stable') were pre-established in undifferentiated cells, with enhancers constitutively marked by H3K27ac. The stable class was associated with the canonical conformation regulator cohesin, whereas the gained class was not, implying distinct mechanisms of contact formation and regulation. Analysis of stable enhancers identified a new, essential role for a constitutively expressed, lineage-restricted ETS-family transcription factor, EHF, in epidermal differentiation. Furthermore, neither class of contacts was observed in pluripotent cells, suggesting that lineage-specific chromatin structure is established in tissue progenitor cells and is further remodeled in terminal differentiation.",Nat.

We previously showed that EBV(+) gastric cancer presents an extremely high-methylation epigenotype and this aberrant DNA methylation causes silencing of multiple tumour suppressor genes. However, the mechanisms that drive EBV infection-mediated tumorigenesis, including other epigenomic alteration, remain unclear. We analysed epigenetic alterations induced by EBV infection especially at enhancer regions, to elucidate their contribution to tumorigenesis. We performed ChIP sequencing on H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, and H3K9me3 in gastric epithelial cells infected or not with EBV. We showed that repressive marks were redistributed after EBV infection, resulting in aberrant enhancer activation and repression. Enhancer dysfunction led to the activation of pathways related to cancer hallmarks (e.g., resisting cell death, disrupting cellular energetics, inducing invasion, evading growth suppressors, sustaining proliferative signalling, angiogenesis, and tumour-promoting inflammation) and inactivation of tumour suppressive pathways. Deregulation of cancer-related genes in EBV-infected gastric epithelial cells was also observed in clinical EBV(+) gastric cancer specimens.

However, relatively little is known about the effect of antibiotic use in cell culture on gene expression and the extent to which this treatment could confound results. To comprehensively characterize the effect of antibiotic treatment on gene expression, we performed RNA-seq and ChIP-seq for H3K27ac on HepG2 cells, a human liver cell line commonly used for pharmacokinetic, metabolism and genomic studies, cultured in media supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin (PenStrep) or vehicle control. We identified 209 PenStrep-responsive genes, including transcription factors such as ATF3 that are likely to alter the regulation of other genes. Pathway analyses found a significant enrichment for ""xenobiotic metabolism signaling"" and ""PXR/RXR activation"" pathways. Our H3K27ac ChIP-seq identified 9,514 peaks that are PenStrep responsive. These peaks were enriched near genes that function in cell differentiation, tRNA modification, nuclease activity and protein dephosphorylation. Our results suggest that PenStrep treatment can significantly alter gene expression and regulation in a common liver cell type such as HepG2, advocating that antibiotic treatment should be taken into account when carrying out genetic, genomic or other biological assays in cultured cells.",Sci Rep,2017,"['Ryu AH', 'Eckalbar WL', 'Kreimer A', 'Yosef N', 'Ahituv N']"
28786938,Super-Resolution Localization Microscopy of γ-H2AX and Heterochromatin after Folate Deficiency.,"Folate is an essential water-soluble vitamin in food and nutrition supplements. As a one-carbon source, it is involved in many central regulatory processes, such as DNA, RNA, and protein methylation as well as DNA synthesis and repair. Deficiency in folate is considered to be associated with an increased incidence of several malignancies, including cervical cancer that is etiologically linked to an infection with ""high-risk"" human papilloma viruses (HPV). However, it is still not known how a recommended increase in dietary folate after its deprivation affects the physiological status of cells. To study the impact of folate depletion and its subsequent reconstitution in single cells, we used quantitative chromatin conformation measurements obtained by super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, i.e., single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). As a read-out, we examined the levels and the (re)positioning of γ-H2AX tags and histone H3K9me3 heterochromatin tags after immunostaining in three-dimensional (3D)-conserved cell nuclei. As model, we used HPV16 positive immortalized human keratinocytes that were cultivated under normal, folate deficient, and reconstituted conditions for different periods of time. The results were compared to cells continuously cultivated in standard folate medium. After 13 weeks in low folate, an increase in the phosphorylation of the histone H2AX was noted, indicative of an accumulation of DNA double strand breaks. DNA repair activity represented by the formation of those γ-H2AX clusters was maintained during the following 15 weeks of examination. However, the clustered arrangements of tags appeared to relax in a time-dependent manner. Parallel to the repair activity, the chromatin methylation activity increased as detected by H3K9me3 tags. The progress of DNA double strand repair was accompanied by a reduction of the detected nucleosome density around the γ-H2AX clusters, suggesting a shift from hetero- to euchromatin to allow access to the repair machinery. In conclusion, these data demonstrated a folate-dependent repair activity and chromatin re-organization on the SMLM nanoscale level. This offers new opportunities to further investigate folate-induced chromatin re-organization and the associated mechanisms.",Int J Mol Sci,2017,"['Bach M', 'Savini C', 'Krufczik M', 'Cremer C', 'Rösl F', 'Hausmann M']"
28784721,Tet-Mediated DNA Demethylation Is Required for SWI/SNF-Dependent Chromatin Remodeling and Histone-Modifying Activities That Trigger Expression of the Sp7 Osteoblast Master Gene during Mesenchymal Lineage Commitment.,"Here we assess histone modification, chromatin remodeling, and DNA methylation processes that coordinately control the expression of the bone master transcription factor Sp7 (osterix) during mesenchymal lineage commitment in mammalian cells. We find that Sp7 gene silencing is mediated by DNA methyltransferase1/3 (DNMT1/3)-, histone deacetylase 1/2/4 (HDAC1/2/4)-, Setdb1/Suv39h1-, and Ezh1/2-containing complexes. In contrast, Sp7 gene activation involves changes in histone modifications, accompanied by decreased nucleosome enrichment and DNA demethylation mediated by SWI/SNF- and Tet1/Tet2-containing complexes, respectively. Inhibition of DNA methylation triggers changes in the histone modification profile and chromatin-remodeling events leading to Sp7 gene expression. Tet1/Tet2 silencing prevents Sp7 expression during osteoblast differentiation as it impairs DNA demethylation and alters the recruitment of histone methylase (COMPASS)-, histone demethylase (Jmjd2a/Jmjd3)-, and SWI/SNF-containing complexes to the Sp7 promoter. The dissection of these interconnected epigenetic mechanisms that govern Sp7 gene activation reveals a hierarchical process where regulatory components mediating DNA demethylation play a leading role.",Mol.

We show that the genomes of a cancer cell subpopulation that survives treatment with otherwise lethal drugs, the drug-tolerant persisters (DTPs), exhibit a repressed chromatin state characterized by increased methylation of histone H3 lysines 9 and 27 (H3K9 and H3K27). We also show that survival of DTPs is, in part, maintained by regulators of H3K9me3-mediated heterochromatin formation and that the observed increase in H3K9me3 in DTPs is most prominent over long interspersed repeat element 1 (LINE-1). Disruption of the repressive chromatin over LINE-1 elements in DTPs results in DTP ablation, which is partially rescued by reducing LINE-1 expression or function.",Cancer Cell,2017,"['Guler GD', 'Tindell CA', 'Pitti R', 'Wilson C', 'Nichols K', 'KaiWai Cheung T', 'Kim HJ', 'Wongchenko M', 'Yan Y', 'Haley B', 'Cuellar T', 'Webster J', 'Alag N', 'Hegde G', 'Jackson E', 'Nance TL', 'Giresi PG', 'Chen KB', 'Liu J', 'Jhunjhunwala S', 'Settleman J', 'Stephan JP', 'Arnott D', 'Classon M']"

However, the mechanism by which remodellers discriminate between different nucleosome substrates is poorly understood. Many chromatin remodelling proteins possess conserved protein domains that interact with nucleosomal features. Here we used a quantitative high-throughput approach, based on the use of a DNA-barcoded mononucleosome library, to profile the biochemical activity of human ISWI family remodellers in response to a diverse set of nucleosome modifications. We show that accessory (non-ATPase) subunits of ISWI remodellers can distinguish between differentially modified nucleosomes, directing remodelling activity towards specific nucleosome substrates according to their modification state. Unexpectedly, we show that the nucleosome acidic patch is necessary for maximum activity of all ISWI remodellers evaluated. This dependence also extends to CHD and SWI/SNF family remodellers, suggesting that the acidic patch may be generally required for chromatin remodelling. Critically, remodelling activity can be regulated by modifications neighbouring the acidic patch, signifying that it may act as a tunable interaction hotspot for ATP-dependent chromatin remodellers and, by extension, many other chromatin effectors that engage this region of the nucleosome surface.",Nature,2017,"['Dann GP', 'Liszczak GP', 'Bagert JD', 'Müller MM', 'Nguyen UTT', 'Wojcik F', 'Brown ZZ', 'Bos J', 'Panchenko T', 'Pihl R', 'Pollock SB', 'Diehl KL', 'Allis CD', 'Muir TW']"
28765174,Role of telomeric repeat-containing RNA in telomeric chromatin remodeling during the early expansion of human embryonic stem cells.,"This study aimed to explore the role of telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) in telomeric chromatin remodeling during the early expansion of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). During the derivation of hESCs, histone demethylation in the telomeric region facilitates telomerase-mediated telomere elongation. An adequate telomere repeat is essential for hESCs to acquire and/or maintain the unlimited symmetric division, which suggests that there is a link between pluripotency and telomere maintenance. The present study found that the gradual decrease in TERRA levels and related TERRA foci were correlated with telomeric length elongation in the early expansion of hESCs. In addition, TERRA participated in telomeric chromatin remodeling by cooperating with SUV39H1 (suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 1/2) to propagate telomeric heterochromatin marker, histone H3 trimethylation of lysine 9. Moreover, the fibroblast growth factor signaling pathway, which is activated in hESCs, could suppress TERRA levels ",FASEB J.,2017,"['Zeng S', 'Liu L', 'Sun Y', 'Lu G', 'Lin G']"

We used the bull as a unique model organism for the study of male fertility because cattle genetics and physiology is similar to those of other mammals including humans. Moreover, reliable fertility data along with well-established in vitro systems are available for bovine. The objective of this original study was to ascertain evolutionary diversification and expression dynamics of Testis Specific Histone 2B (TH2B) in sperm from Holstein bulls with different fertility scores.
METHODS: The intensity of TH2B was determined by using flow cytometry in sperm from 13 high and 13 low fertility bulls. Expression levels of TH2B were measured using immunofluorescence and Western blotting in sperm from five high and five low fertility bulls. Sequence identity, evolutionary distance and interactome of TH2B were evaluated by dotmatcher, STRING and Cytoscape. Data were analyzed using linear mixed effects model and regression plots were drawn.
RESULTS: The intensity of TH2B as measured by flow cytometry was significantly affected by an interaction between fertility group and fertility score (P = 0.0182). The intensity of TH2B in sperm from the high fertility group decreased (P = 0.0055) as fertility increased. TH2B was constantly detectable in sperm and expression levels of TH2B decreased in relation to fertility in sperm from the high fertility group (P = 0.018). TH2B biological functions include male gamete generation, chromosome organization, DNA packaging, DNA conformation change, chromatin organization, nucleosome organization, chromatin disassembly, spermatid nucleus elongation, spermatid nucleus differentiation, sperm motility, chromatin organization, chromatin condensation, chromatin silencing, nucleus organization, and chromatin remodeling (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: We elucidated the cellular localization and molecular physiology of TH2B using both computational and cell biology approaches. In addition to advancing the fundamental science of mammalian male gamete, the present findings can be potentially used to evaluate semen quality and predict male fertility in the future.

28762778,Epigenomic analysis in a cell-based model reveals the roles of H3K9me3 in breast cancer transformation.,"AIM: Epigenetic marks are critical regulators of chromatin and gene activity. Their roles in normal physiology and disease states, including cancer development, still remain elusive. Herein, the epigenomic change of H3K9me3, as well as its potential impacts on gene activity and genome stability, was investigated in an in vitro breast cancer transformation model.
METHODS: The global H3K9me3 level was studied with western blotting. The distribution of H3K9me3 on chromatin and gene expression was studied with ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq, respectively.
RESULTS: The global H3K9me3 level decreases during transformation and its distribution on chromatin is reprogrammed. By combining with TCGA data, we identified 67 candidate oncogenes, among which five genes are totally novel. Our analysis further links H3K9me3 with transposon activity, and suggests H3K9me3 reduction increases the cell's sensitivity to DNA damage reagents.
CONCLUSION: H3K9me3 reduction is possibly related with breast cancer transformation by regulating gene expression and chromatin stability during transformation.",Epigenomics,2017,"['Li QL', 'Lei PJ', 'Zhao QY', 'Li L', 'Wei G', 'Wu M']"
28760201,Impact of nucleic acid and methylated H3K9 binding activities of Suv39h1 on its heterochromatin assembly.,"SUV39H is the major histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9)-specific methyltransferase that targets pericentric regions and is crucial for assembling silent heterochromatin. SUV39H recognizes trimethylated H3K9 (H3K9me3) via its chromodomain (CD), and enriched H3K9me3 allows SUV39H to target specific chromosomal regions. However, the detailed targeting mechanisms, especially for naïve chromatin without preexisting H3K9me3, are poorly understood. Here we show that Suv39h1's CD (Suv39h1-CD) binds nucleic acids, and this binding is important for its function in heterochromatin assembly. Suv39h1-CD had higher binding affinity for RNA than DNA, and its ability to bind nucleic acids was independent of its H3K9me3 recognition.

28759046,EZH2-mediated upregulation of ROS1 oncogene promotes oral cancer metastasis.,"Current anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy for oral cancer does not provide satisfactory efficacy due to drug resistance or reduced EGFR level. As an alternative candidate target for therapy, here we identified an oncogene, ROS1, as an important driver for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) metastasis. Among tumors from 188 oral cancer patients, upregulated ROS1 expression strongly correlated with metastasis to lung and lymph nodes. Mechanistic studies uncover that the activated ROS1 results from highly expressed ROS1 gene instead of gene rearrangement, a phenomenon distinct from other cancers. Our data further reveal a novel mechanism that reduced histone methyltransferase EZH2 leads to a lower trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 suppressive modification, relaxes chromatin, and promotes the accessibility of the transcription factor STAT1 to the enhancer and the intron regions of ROS1 target genes, CXCL1 and GLI1, for upregulating their expressions. Down-regulation of ROS1 in highly invasive OSCC cells, nevertheless, reduces cell proliferation and inhibits metastasis to lung in the tail-vein injection and the oral cavity xenograft models. Our findings highlight ROS1 as a candidate biomarker and therapeutic target for OSCC. Finally, we demonstrate that co-targeting of ROS1 and EGFR could potentially offer an effective oral cancer therapy.",Oncogene,2017,"['Shih CH', 'Chang YJ', 'Huang WC', 'Jang TH', 'Kung HJ', 'Wang WC', 'Yang MH', 'Lin MC', 'Huang SF', 'Chou SW', 'Chang E', 'Chiu H', 'Shieh TY', 'Chen YJ', 'Wang LH', 'Chen L']"

Through genetic fine mapping, we prioritized rs9349379, a common SNP in the third intron of the PHACTR1 gene, as the putative causal variant. Epigenomic data from human tissue revealed an enhancer signature at rs9349379 exclusively in aorta, suggesting a regulatory function for this SNP in the vasculature. CRISPR-edited stem cell-derived endothelial cells demonstrate rs9349379 regulates expression of endothelin 1 (EDN1), a gene located 600 kb upstream of PHACTR1. The known physiologic effects of EDN1 on the vasculature may explain the pattern of risk for the five associated diseases.

Microscopy can visualize single cells, but the cell body and organelles can hamper staining and visualization of the nucleus. Normally, chromatin is visualized by immunostaining a fixed sample or by expressing exogenous fluorescently tagged proteins in a live cell. Alternative microscopy tools to observe changes of endogenous chromatin in real-time are needed. Here, we isolated transcriptionally competent nuclei from cells and used antibody staining without fixation to visualize changes in endogenous chromatin. This method allows the real-time addition of drugs and fluorescent probes to one or more nuclei while under microscopy observation. A high-resolution map of 11 endogenous nuclear markers of the histone code, transcription machinery and architecture was obtained in transcriptionally active nuclei by performing confocal and structured illumination microscopy. We detected changes in chromatin modification and localization at the single-nucleus level after inhibition of histone deacetylation.

METHODS: Primary cultured HUVECs were pretreated with 2.5 µM LaCl3 for 30 min followed by 1 µg/ml LPS for 2 h. Pro-inflammatory cytokine and adhesion molecule expressions were determined by real-time RT-PCR and ELISA. NF-κB/p65 nuclear translocation was examined by immunofluorescence and immuno-blot, and its DNA-binding activity was measured by chemiluminescence. Recruitment of NF-κB/p65, Jmjd3, and H3K27me3 to gene promoter regions was determined by ChIP-qPCR.
RESULTS: LaCl3 exhibited no cytotoxic effects to primary HUVECs at concentrations ≤ 50 µM. LPS-mediated TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, MMP-9, and ICAM-1 production, nuclear translocation, and DNA-binding activity of NF-κB/p65, as well as Jmjd3 expression, were all reduced significantly by LaCl3. Furthermore, LaCl3 treatment significantly impaired LPS-induced enrichment of NF-κB/p65 to the promoter regions of TNF-α, MMP-9, IL-1β, ICAM-1, and IL-6; and of Jmjd3 to the promoter regions of TNF-α, MMP-9, IL-1β, and IL-6. H3K27me3 abundance in the promoter regions of TNF-α and ICAM-1 increased significantly in following LaCl3 treatment.

28733670,BRD3 and BRD4 BET Bromodomain Proteins Differentially Regulate Skeletal Myogenesis.,"Myogenic differentiation proceeds through a highly coordinated cascade of gene activation that necessitates epigenomic changes in chromatin structure. Using a screen of small molecule epigenetic probes we identified three compounds which inhibited myogenic differentiation in C2C12 myoblasts; (+)-JQ1, PFI-1, and Bromosporine. These molecules target Bromodomain and Extra Terminal domain (BET) proteins, which are epigenetic readers of acetylated histone lysine tail residues. BETi-mediated anti-myogenic effects were also observed in a model of MYOD1-mediated myogenic conversion of human fibroblasts, and in primary mouse and human myoblasts. All three BET proteins BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4 exhibited distinct and dynamic patterns of protein expression over the course of differentiation without concomitant changes in mRNA levels, suggesting that BET proteins are regulated at the post-transcriptional level. Specific BET protein knockdown by RNA interference revealed that BRD4 was required for myogenic differentiation, whereas BRD3 down-regulation resulted in enhanced myogenic differentiation. ChIP experiments revealed a preferential binding of BRD4 to the Myog promoter during C2C12 myoblast differentiation, co-incident with increased levels of H3K27 acetylation. These results have identified an essential role for BET proteins in the regulation of skeletal myogenesis, and assign distinct functions to BRD3 and BRD4.",Sci Rep,2017,"['Roberts TC', 'Etxaniz U', ""Dall'Agnese A"", 'Wu SY', 'Chiang CM', 'Brennan PE', 'Wood MJA', 'Puri PL']"

28717873,Orchestration of H3K27 methylation: mechanisms and therapeutic implication.,"Histone proteins constitute the core component of the nucleosome, the basic unit of chromatin. Chemical modifications of histone proteins affect their interaction with genomic DNA, the accessibility of recognized proteins, and the recruitment of enzymatic complexes to activate or diminish specific transcriptional programs to modulate cellular response to extracellular stimuli or insults. Methylation of histone proteins was demonstrated 50 years ago; however, the biological significance of each methylated residue and the integration between these histone markers are still under intensive investigation. Methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27) is frequently found in the heterochromatin and conceives a repressive marker that is linked with gene silencing. The identification of enzymes that add or erase the methyl group of H3K27 provides novel insights as to how this histone marker is dynamically controlled under different circumstances. Here we summarize the methyltransferases and demethylases involved in the methylation of H3K27 and show the new evidence by which the H3K27 methylation can be established via an alternative mechanism.

28717009,Acetylation on histone H3 lysine 9 mediates a switch from transcription initiation to elongation.,"The transition from transcription initiation to elongation is a key regulatory step in gene expression, which requires RNA polymerase II (pol II) to escape promoter proximal pausing on chromatin. Although elongation factors promote pause release leading to transcription elongation, the role of epigenetic modifications during this critical transition step is poorly understood. Two histone marks on histone H3, lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac), co-localize on active gene promoters and are associated with active transcription. H3K4me3 can promote transcription initiation, yet the functional role of H3K9ac is much less understood. We hypothesized that H3K9ac may function downstream of transcription initiation by recruiting proteins important for the next step of transcription. Here, we describe a functional role for H3K9ac in promoting pol II pause release by directly recruiting the super elongation complex (SEC) to chromatin. H3K9ac serves as a substrate for direct binding of the SEC, as does acetylation of histone H4 lysine 5 to a lesser extent. Furthermore, lysine 9 on histone H3 is necessary for maximal pol II pause release through SEC action, and loss of H3K9ac increases the pol II pausing index on a subset of genes in HeLa cells. At select gene promoters, H3K9ac loss or SEC depletion reduces gene expression and increases paused pol II occupancy. We therefore propose that an ordered histone code can promote progression through the transcription cycle, providing new mechanistic insight indicating that SEC recruitment to certain acetylated histones on a subset of genes stimulates the subsequent release of paused pol II needed for transcription elongation.",J.

Both events are under the control of Heat Shock Factor I (HSF1). Here we show that under heat shock, HSF1 recruits major cellular acetyltransferases, GCN5, TIP60 and p300 to pericentric heterochromatin leading to a targeted hyperacetylation of pericentric chromatin. Redistribution of histone acetylation toward pericentric region in turn directs the recruitment of Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal (BET) proteins BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, which are required for satellite III transcription by RNAP II.

Here, we show that the human BRM (hBRM) bromodomain (BRD) has moderate specificity for H3K14ac. Surprisingly, we also find that both BRG1 and hBRM BRDs have DNA-binding activity. We demonstrate that the BRDs associate with DNA through a surface basic patch and that the BRD and an adjacent AT-hook make multivalent contacts with DNA, leading to robust affinity and moderate specificity for AT-rich elements. Although we show that the BRDs can bind to both DNA and H3K14ac simultaneously, the histone-binding activity does not contribute substantially to nucleosome targeting in vitro. In addition, we find that neither BRD histone nor DNA binding contribute to the global chromatin affinity of BRG1 in mouse embryonic stem cells. Together, our results suggest that association of the BRG1/hBRM BRD with nucleosomes plays a regulatory rather than targeting role in BAF activity.",Nat Commun,2017,"['Morrison EA', 'Sanchez JC', 'Ronan JL', 'Farrell DP', 'Varzavand K', 'Johnson JK', 'Gu BX', 'Crabtree GR', 'Musselman CA']"
28705657,Role of glutathione in the regulation of epigenetic mechanisms in disease.,"Epigenetics is a rapidly growing field that studies gene expression modifications not involving changes in the DNA sequence. Histone H3, one of the basic proteins in the nucleosomes that make up chromatin, is S-glutathionylated in mammalian cells and tissues, making Gamma-L-glutamyl-L-cysteinylglycine, glutathione (GSH), a physiological antioxidant and second messenger in cells, a new post-translational modifier of the histone code that alters the structure of the nucleosome. However, the role of GSH in the epigenetic mechanisms likely goes beyond a mere structural function. Evidence supports the hypothesis that there is a link between GSH metabolism and the control of epigenetic mechanisms at different levels (i.e., substrate availability, enzymatic activity for DNA methylation, changes in the expression of microRNAs, and participation in the histone code). However, little is known about the molecular pathways by which GSH can control epigenetic events. Studying mutations in enzymes involved in GSH metabolism and the alterations of the levels of cofactors affecting epigenetic mechanisms appears challenging. However, the number of diseases induced by aberrant epigenetic regulation is growing, so elucidating the intricate network between GSH metabolism, oxidative stress and epigenetics could shed light on how their deregulation contributes to the development of neurodegeneration, cancer, metabolic pathologies and many other types of diseases.",Free Radic.

Despite continuous efforts to identify molecular markers for early detection, and to develop efficient treatments, the overall survival and prognosis of HNSCC patients remain poor. Accumulated scientific evidences suggest that epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation, histone covalent modifications, chromatin remodeling and non-coding RNAs, are frequently involved in oral carcinogenesis, tumor progression, and resistance to therapy. Epigenetic alterations occur in an unsystematic manner or as part of the aberrant transcriptional machinery, which promotes selective advantage to the tumor cells. Epigenetic modifications also contribute to cellular plasticity during tumor progression and to the formation of cancer stem cells (CSCs), a small subset of tumor cells with self-renewal ability. CSCs are involved in the development of intrinsic or acquired therapy resistance, and tumor recurrences or relapse. Therefore, the understanding and characterization of epigenetic modifications associated with head and neck carcinogenesis, and the prospective identification of epigenetic markers associated with CSCs, hold the promise for novel therapeutic strategies to fight tumors.

Moreover, chromatin regulators are frequently mutated in this disease. We found that ccRCC displays increased H3K27 acetylation and a shift toward mono- or unmethylated H3K27 caused by an HIF-dependent increase in H3K27 demethylase activity. Using a focused short hairpin RNA library, as well as CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9) and a pharmacological inhibitor, we discovered that pVHL-defective ccRCC cells are hyperdependent on the H3K27 methyltransferase EZH1 for survival.

Loss of the NURD subunit Deleted in Oral Cancer 1 (DOC1) is associated with human oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs). Here, we show that restoration of DOC1 expression in OSCC cells leads to a reversal of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This is caused by the DOC1-dependent targeting of NURD to repress key transcriptional regulators of EMT. NURD recruitment drives extensive epigenetic reprogramming, including eviction of the SWI/SNF remodeler, formation of inaccessible chromatin, H3K27 deacetylation, and binding of PRC2 and KDM1A, followed by H3K27 methylation and H3K4 demethylation.

We report here that BRD4 increases the proliferation and represses the apoptosis of gastric cancer cells through activating c-MYC via transcriptional and epigenetic regulation mechanisms. Expression analyses in both small and large cohort of sample show that BRD4 is highly expressed in gastric cancer tissues/cells when compared with the adjacent non-tumor tissues/normal cells. We also find a positive correlation between the expression of BRD4 and c-MYC in patient samples. The repression of BRD4 by siRNAs leads to the down-regulation of c-MYC in gastric cancer cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR and luciferase assays show that BRD4 binds to and coordinately activates c-MYC promoter, indicating that c-MYC is transcriptional target of BRD4 and BRD4 regulates its basal expression. Further evidence show that the histone acetylation inhibitor reduces the binding of BRD4 as well as the histone activation level on c-MYC promoter, and leads to the down-regulation of c-MYC, suggesting that BRD4 regulates the expression of c-MYC through epigenetic mechanism. Functionally, the suppression of BRD4 leads to growth inhibition and apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. Force expression of c-MYC alongside with BRD4 repression rescue the anti-cancer effects caused by BRD4 repression. Collectively, our data not only uncovered the mechanism of BRD4 in regulating the proliferation of gastric cancer cells but also provides a new therapeutic strategy for this type of cancer.",J. Cell.

28678843,KSHV encoded ORF59 modulates histone arginine methylation of the viral genome to promote viral reactivation.,"Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) persists in a highly-ordered chromatin structure inside latently infected cells with the majority of the viral genome having repressive marks. However, upon reactivation the viral chromatin landscape changes into 'open' chromatin through the involvement of lysine demethylases and methyltransferases. Besides methylation of lysine residues of histone H3, arginine methylation of histone H4 plays an important role in controlling the compactness of the chromatin. Symmetric methylation of histone H4 at arginine 3 (H4R3me2s) negatively affects the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), an active epigenetic mark deposited on the viral chromatin during reactivation. We identified a novel binding partner to KSHV viral DNA processivity factor, ORF59-a protein arginine methyl transferase 5 (PRMT5). PRMT5 is an arginine methyltransferase that dimethylates arginine 3 (R3) of histone H4 in a symmetric manner, one hallmark of condensed chromatin. Our ChIP-seq data of symmetrically methylated H4 arginine 3 showed a significant decrease in H4R3me2s on the viral genome of reactivated cells as compared to the latent cells. Reduction in arginine methylation correlated with the binding of ORF59 on the viral chromatin and disruption of PRMT5 from its adapter protein, COPR5 (cooperator of PRMT5). Binding of PRMT5 through COPR5 is important for symmetric methylation of H4R3 and the expression of ORF59 competitively reduces the association of PRMT5 with COPR5, leading to a reduction in PRMT5 mediated arginine methylation. This ultimately resulted in a reduced level of symmetrically methylated H4R3 and increased levels of H3K4me3 marks, contributing to the formation of an open chromatin for transcription and DNA replication. Depletion of PRMT5 levels led to a decrease in symmetric methylation and increase in viral gene transcription confirming the role of PRMT5 in viral reactivation.

The pan-deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat (Farydac®, LBH589) is developed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals and a newly US FDA approved drug for the multiple myeloma. It is under clinical investigation for a range of hematological and solid tumors worldwide in both oral and intravenous formulations. Panobinostat inhibits tumor cell growth by interacting with acetylation of histones and nonhistone proteins as well as various apoptotic, autophagy-mediated targets and various tumorigenesis pathways involved in the development of cancer. The current article summarizes the status of panobinostat in gastrointestinal cancers. Preclinical and clinical data suggest that panobinostat has potential inhibitory activity in hepatocellular, pancreatic, colorectal, gastric and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Clinical evaluations of panobinostat are currently underway. Herein, we have also reviewed the rationale behind the combination therapy under the trials and possible future prospective for the treatment of GI tumors.",Curr Cancer Drug Targets,2018,"['Singh A', 'Patel P', 'Jageshwar', 'Patel VK', 'Jain DK', 'Kamal M', 'Rajak H']"
28654055,Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in Mouse T-cell Lines.,"Signaling pathways regulate gene expression programs via the modulation of the chromatin structure at different levels, such as by post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histone tails, the exchange of canonical histones with histone variants, and nucleosome eviction. Such regulation requires the binding of signal-sensitive transcription factors (TFs) that recruit chromatin-modifying enzymes at regulatory elements defined as enhancers. Understanding how signaling cascades regulate enhancer activity requires a comprehensive analysis of the binding of TFs, chromatin modifying enzymes, and the occupancy of specific histone marks and histone variants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays utilize highly specific antibodies to immunoprecipitate specific protein/DNA complexes. The subsequent analysis of the purified DNA allows for the identification the region occupied by the protein recognized by the antibody. This work describes a protocol to efficiently perform ChIP of histone proteins in a mature mouse T-cell line. The presented protocol allows for the performance of ChIP assays in a reasonable timeframe and with high reproducibility.",J Vis Exp,2017,"['Giaimo BD', 'Ferrante F', 'Borggrefe T']"
28651105,Heterogeneous epigenetic regulation of HACE1 in Burkitt- Lymphoma-derived cells.,"We examined the consequences of 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep) on HACE1 expression in human Burkitt- Lymphoma-derived cells to investigate fundamental molecular mechanisms that control its expression. We treated the human Burkitt- Lymphoma-derived cells lines Ramos and Raji with DZNep and examined HACE1 mRNA expression by RT-PCR. We also studied the effect of DZNep on the methylation of lysine 9 and 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3 and H3K9me2) associated with the CpG88 and CpG177 islands of the HACE1 promoters by chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative PCR. CpG88 (hypomethylated) of the HACE1 promoter was enriched for histone marks H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 whereas CpG177 (hypermethylated) was only enriched for H3K9me2. DZNep treatment increased HACE1 gene expression which was further increased by the addition of trichostatine A (TSA), a promising therapeutic compound for the treatment of human B-Lymphoma. Histone methylation (both H3K9me2 and H3K27me3) of the HACE1 promoter concomitantly decreased. Our experiments suggest that HACE1 can be downregulated by methylation of its promoter region chromatin (H3K27me3 and H3K9me2), making HACE1 a potential target for DZNep combined with TSA. These results highlight the heterogeneity of HACE1 regulation in B-lymphoma and suggest that successful drug-induced restoration of epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes will require accurate characterization of cell type- and locus-specific gene silencing mechanisms.",Leuk.

28650317,Serine ADP-ribosylation reversal by the hydrolase ARH3.,"ADP-ribosylation (ADPr) is a posttranslational modification (PTM) of proteins that controls many cellular processes, including DNA repair, transcription, chromatin regulation and mitosis. A number of proteins catalyse the transfer and hydrolysis of ADPr, and also specify how and when the modification is conjugated to the targets. We recently discovered a new form of ADPr that is attached to serine residues in target proteins (Ser-ADPr) and showed that this PTM is specifically made by PARP1/HPF1 and PARP2/HPF1 complexes. In this work, we found by quantitative proteomics that histone Ser-ADPr is reversible in cells during response to DNA damage. By screening for the hydrolase that is responsible for the reversal of Ser-ADPr, we identified ARH3/ADPRHL2 as capable of efficiently and specifically removing Ser-ADPr of histones and other proteins. We further showed that Ser-ADPr is a major PTM in cells after DNA damage and that this signalling is dependent on ARH3.",Elife,2017,"['Fontana P', 'Bonfiglio JJ', 'Palazzo L', 'Bartlett E', 'Matic I', 'Ahel I']"

Here we analyzed how the methionine substitution alters the stability of H3.3 nucleosomes in vitro and modifies its kinetic properties in live cells. We also determined whether the presence of mutant nucleosomes perturbed the mobility of the PRC2 subunit Ezh2 (enhancer-of-zeste homolog 2). We found that K27 M nucleosomes maintained the wild-type molecular architecture both at the level of bulk histones and single nucleosomes and followed similar diffusion kinetics to wild-type histones in live cells. Nevertheless, we observed a remarkable differential recovery of Ezh2 in response to transcriptional stress that was accompanied by a faster diffusion rate of the mobile fraction of Ezh2 and a significantly increased immobile fraction, suggesting tighter chromatin binding of Ezh2 upon transcription inhibition. The differential recovery of Ezh2 was dependent on transcription, however, it was independent from K27 M mutation status. These biophysical characteristics shed more light on the mechanism of histone H3.3 K27M in glioma genesis in relation to the kinetic properties of Ezh2.",Biochem. Biophys. Res.

28645917,Multivalent binding of PWWP2A to H2A.Z regulates mitosis and neural crest differentiation.,"Replacement of canonical histones with specialized histone variants promotes altering of chromatin structure and function. The essential histone variant H2A.Z affects various DNA-based processes via poorly understood mechanisms. Here, we determine the comprehensive interactome of H2A.Z and identify PWWP2A as a novel H2A.Z-nucleosome binder. PWWP2A is a functionally uncharacterized, vertebrate-specific protein that binds very tightly to chromatin through a concerted multivalent binding mode. Two internal protein regions mediate H2A.Z-specificity and nucleosome interaction, whereas the PWWP domain exhibits direct DNA binding. Genome-wide mapping reveals that PWWP2A binds selectively to H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes with strong preference for promoters of highly transcribed genes. In human cells, its depletion affects gene expression and impairs proliferation via a mitotic delay. While PWWP2A does not influence H2A.Z occupancy, the C-terminal tail of H2A.Z is one important mediator to recruit PWWP2A to chromatin.

28643791,EWSR1 fusion proteins mediate PAX7 expression in Ewing sarcoma.,"PAX7 is a paired-box transcription factor that is required for the developmental specification of adult skeletal muscle progenitors in mice. We previously demonstrated PAX7 expression as a marker of skeletal muscle differentiation in rhabdomyosarcoma. Here, using analyses of published whole-genome gene expression microarray data, we identify PAX7 as a gene with significantly increased expression in Ewing sarcoma in comparison to CIC-DUX4 round cell sarcoma. Analysis of PAX7 in a large cohort of 103 Ewing sarcoma cases by immunohistochemistry revealed expression in 99.0% of cases (102/103). PAX7 expression was noted in cases demonstrating three distinct Ewing sarcoma EWSR1 translocations involving FLI1, ERG, and NFATc2. No PAX7 expression was observed in any of 27 cases of CIC-DUX4 sarcoma by immunohistochemistry (0%; 0/27). Exploring the mechanism of PAX7 expression in Ewing sarcoma using curated RNA- and ChIP-sequencing data, we demonstrate that the EWSR1 fusion protein is required for PAX7 expression in Ewing sarcoma and identify a candidate EWSR1-FLI1-bound PAX7 enhancer that coincides with both a consensus GGAA repeat-containing binding site and a peak of regulatory H3K27 acetylation. Taken together, our findings provide mechanistic support for the utility of PAX7 immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma, while linking this sarcoma of uncertain histogenesis to a key transcriptional regulator of mammalian muscle progenitor cells.",Mod.

We demonstrated EGCG ability to inhibit acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell proliferation and cause apoptosis. In addition, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis revealed elevated expression of genes associated with cell cycle arrest and differentiation (p27, PCAF, C/EBPα, and C/EBPɛ). Furthermore, EGCG caused anti-cancerous epigenetic changes: downregulation of epigenetic modifiers DNMT1, HDAC1, HDAC2, and G9a was observed by RT-qPCR analysis. Reduced amount of H3K9me2 after treatment with EGCG confirmed G9a downregulation. Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) core components were also shown to be downregulated in gene and protein level. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis revealed that EGCG treatment enhanced hyperacetylated H4 and acetylated H3K14 histones binding to the promoter regions of p27, PCAF, C/EBPα, and C/EBPɛ and reduced binding effect to PRC2 core component genes EZH2, SUZ12, and EED.

28640660,Chromosome territory relocation paradigm during DNA damage response: Some insights from molecular biology to physics.,"Among the many facets of DNA damage response (DDR), relocation of chromosome territories (CTs) is most intriguing. We have previously reported that cisplatin induced DDR in human dermal fibroblasts led to relocation of CTs 12, 15 from the nuclear periphery to its interior while CTs 19, 17 repositioned from the interior to its periphery. Studies of CT relocation remain nascent as we begin unraveling the role of key players in DDR to demonstrate its mechanistic basis. Consolidating our recent reports, we argue that γH2AX-signaling leads to enhanced recruitment of nuclear myosin 1 (NM1) to chromatin, which via its motor function, results in CT repositioning. Next, we invoke a novel systems-level theory that subsumed CTs as pairs, not solo entities, to present the physical basis for plasticity in interphase CT arrangement. Subsequently, we posited that our systems-level theory describes a unified physical basis for non-random positioning of CTs in interphase nuclei across disparate eukaryotes.",Nucleus,2017,"['Fatakia SN', 'Kulashreshtha M', 'Mehta IS', 'Rao BJ']"
28639249,Histone Post-Translational Modifications and Nucleosome Organisation in Transcriptional Regulation: Some Open Questions.,"The organisation of chromatin is first discussed to conclude that nucleosomes play both structural and transcription-regulatory roles. The presence of nucleosomes makes difficult the access of transcriptional factors to their target sequences and the action of RNA polymerases. The histone post-translational modifications and nucleosome remodelling are first discussed, from a historical point of view, as mechanisms to remove the obstacles imposed by chromatin structure to transcription. Instead of reviewing the state of the art of the whole field, this review is centred on some open questions. First, some ""non-classical"" histone modifications, such as short-chain acylations other than acetylation, are considered to conclude that their relationship with the concentration of metabolic intermediaries might make of them a sensor of the physiological state of the cells. Then attention is paid to the interest of studying chromatin organisation and epigenetic marks at a single nucleosome level as a complement to genome-wide approaches. Finally, as a consequence of the above questions, the review focuses on the presence of multiple histone post-translational modifications on a single nucleosome. The methods to detect them and their meaning, with special emphasis on bivalent marks, are discussed.",Adv. Exp. Med. Biol.,2017,"['Castillo J', 'López-Rodas G', 'Franco L']"
28637181,Crosstalk between histone modifications indicates that inhibition of arginine methyltransferase CARM1 activity reverses HIV latency.,"In eukaryotic cells, the gene expression status is strictly controlled by epigenetic modifications on chromatin. The repressive status of chromatin largely contributes to HIV latency. Studies have shown that modification of histone H3K27 acts as a key molecular switch for activation or suppression of many cellular genes. In this study, we found that K27-acetylated histone H3 specifically recruited Super Elongation Complex (SEC), the transcriptional elongation complex essential for HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR)-mediated and general cellular transcription. Interestingly, H3K27 acetylation further stimulates H3R26 methylation, which subsequently abrogates the recruitment of SEC, forming a negative feedback regulatory loop. Importantly, by inhibiting methyltransferase activity of CARM1, the enzyme responsible for H3R26 methylation, HIV-1 transcription is reactivated in several HIV latency cell models, including a primary resting CD4+ T cell model. When combined with other latency disrupting compounds such as JQ1 or vorinostat/SAHA, the CARM1 inhibitor achieved synergistic effects on HIV-1 activation. This study suggests that coordinated and dynamic modifications at histone H3K27 and H3R26 orchestrate HIV-1 LTR-mediated transcription, and potentially opens a new avenue to disrupt latent HIV-1 infection by targeting specific epigenetic enzymes.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2017,"['Zhang Z', 'Nikolai BC', 'Gates LA', 'Jung SY', 'Siwak EB', 'He B', 'Rice AP', ""O'Malley BW"", 'Feng Q']"
28634400,Chronic treatment with cisplatin induces chemoresistance through the TIP60-mediated Fanconi anemia and homologous recombination repair pathways.,"The Fanconi anemia pathway in coordination with homologous recombination is essential to repair interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) caused by cisplatin. TIP60 belongs to the MYST family of acetyltransferases and is involved in DNA repair and regulation of gene transcription. Although the physical interaction between the TIP60 and FANCD2 proteins has been identified that is critical for ICL repair, it is still elusive whether TIP60 regulates the expression of FA and HR genes. In this study, we found that the chemoresistant nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells, derived from chronic treatment of cisplatin, show elevated expression of TIP60. Furthermore, TIP60 binds to the promoters of FANCD2 and BRCA1 by using the chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments and promote the expression of FANCD2 and BRCA1. Importantly, the depletion of TIP60 significantly reduces sister chromatid exchange, a measurement of HR efficiency. The similar results were also shown in the FNACD2-, and BRCA1-deficient cells. Additionally, these TIP60-deficient cells encounter more frequent stalled forks, as well as more DNA double-strand breaks resulting from the collapse of stalled forks. Taken together, our results suggest that TIP60 promotes the expression of FA and HR genes that are important for ICL repair and the chemoresistant phenotype under chronic treatment with cisplatin.",Sci Rep,2017,"['Su WP', 'Ho YC', 'Wu CK', 'Hsu SH', 'Shiu JL', 'Huang JC', 'Chang SB', 'Chiu WT', 'Hung JJ', 'Liu TL', 'Wu WS', 'Wu PY', 'Su WC', 'Chang JY', 'Liaw H']"

We then analyzed the phylogenetic relationships among the E3 ligase for H2Bub, its E2 Rad6 and their partner WW domain-containing adaptor with a coiled-coil (WAC) or Lge1, and found that the molecular mechanism underlying H2Bub is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals. However, RNF20 has diverse physiologic functions in different organisms, which might be caused by the evolutionary divergency of their domain/motif architectures. In the current extra view, we not only elucidate the evolutionarily conserved molecular mechanism underlying H2Bub, but also discuss the diverse physiologic functions of RNF20 during meiosis.",Nucleus,2017,"['Wang L', 'Cao C', 'Wang F', 'Zhao J', 'Li W']"
28620234,EZH2-mediated epigenetic silencing of TIMP2 promotes ovarian cancer migration and invasion.,"Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is often increased in malignant tumors and is involved in metastasis. EZH2 silences gene expression by tri-methylating the lysine 27 residue of histone H3 (H3K27me3). However, the mechanism underlying EZH2 promotion of ovarian cancer metastasis remains elusive. Here, we showed that EZH2 is up-regulated in ovarian cancer and is associated with tumor metastasis and poor survival by mRNA sequencing and microarray results from databases. Tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry results revealed that EZH2 was negatively correlated with the expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP2). EZH2 overexpression inhibited TIMP2 expression and promoted proteolytic activities of matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 and vice versa. EZH2 promoted ovarian cancer invasion and migration, which could be largely reversed by TIMP2 down-regulation in vitro and in vivo. Both H3K27me3 inhibition and demethylation could reduce methylation of the TIMP2 promoter and finally reactivate TIMP2 transcription. The presence of EZH2 and H3K27me3 at the TIMP2 promoter was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. H3K27me3 and DNA methyltransferases at the promoter were significantly increased by EZH2 overexpression. These results suggest that EZH2 inhibits TIMP2 expression via H3K27me3 and DNA methylation, which relieve the repression of MMP and facilitate ovarian cancer invasion and migration.",Sci Rep,2017,"['Yi X', 'Guo J', 'Guo J', 'Sun S', 'Yang P', 'Wang J', 'Li Y', 'Xie L', 'Cai J', 'Wang Z']"

Cells employ diverse mechanisms for controlling heterochromatin states through proteins that modify DNA and histones. An emerging theme is that chromatin-associated RNAs play important roles in regulating heterochromatin proteins by controlling their initial recruitment to chromatin, their stable association with chromatin, their spread along chromatin, or their enzymatic activity. Major challenges for the field include not only identifying regulatory RNAs, but understanding the underlying biochemical mechanisms for how RNAs associate with chromatin, the specificity of interactions between heterochromatin proteins and RNA, and how these binding events manifest in cells to orchestrate RNA-mediated regulation of heterochromatin.",Curr.

28611266,Retinoid X Receptor α-Dependent HBV Minichromosome Remodeling and Viral Replication.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: The HBV covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is organized into a minichromosome in the nuclei of infected hepatocytes through interactions with histone and nonhistone proteins. Retinoid X receptor α (RXRα), a liver-enriched nuclear receptor, participates in regulation of HBV replication and transcription through modulation of HBV enhancer 1 and core promoter activity.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study investigated RXRα involvement in HBV cccDNA epigenetic modifications. Quantitative cccDNA chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was applied to study the recruitment of RXRα, histones, and chromatin-modifying enzymes to HBV minichromosome in HepG2 cells after transfection of the linear HBV genome.
RESULTS: RXRα Was found to directly bind to HBV cccDNA; recruitment of RXRα to HBV mini-chromosome paralleled HBV replication, histone recruitment, and histone acetylation in HBVcccDNA. Moreover, RXRα overexpression or knock-down significantly increased or impaired the recruitment of the p300 acetyltransferase to cccDNAminichromosome.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirmed the regulation of RXRα on HBV replication in vitro and demonstrated the modulation of RXRα on HBV cccDNA epigenetics.

28611184,Regulation of the ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation of CREB-binding protein modulates histone acetylation and lung inflammation.,"Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) is a histone acetyltransferase that plays a pivotal role in the control of histone modification and the expression of cytokine-encoding genes in inflammatory diseases, including sepsis and lung injury. We found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit FBXL19 targeted CBP for site-specific ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. The ubiquitylation-dependent degradation of CBP reduced the extent of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-dependent histone acetylation and cytokine release in mouse lung epithelial cells and in a mouse model of sepsis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the deubiquitylating enzyme USP14 (ubiquitin-specific peptidase 14) stabilized CBP by reducing its ubiquitylation. LPS increased the stability of CBP by reducing the association between CBP and FBXL19 and by activating USP14. Inhibition of USP14 reduced CBP protein abundance and attenuated LPS-stimulated histone acetylation and cytokine release. Together, our findings delineate the molecular mechanisms through which CBP stability is regulated by FBXL19 and USP14, which results in the modulation of chromatin remodeling and the expression of cytokine-encoding genes.",Sci Signal,2017,"['Wei J', 'Dong S', 'Bowser RK', 'Khoo A', 'Zhang L', 'Jacko AM', 'Zhao Y', 'Zhao J']"
28610839,Fly Fishing for Histones: Catch and Release by Histone Chaperone Intrinsically Disordered Regions and Acidic Stretches.,"Chromatin is the complex of eukaryotic DNA and proteins required for the efficient compaction of the nearly 2-meter-long human genome into a roughly 10-micron-diameter cell nucleus. The fundamental repeating unit of chromatin is the nucleosome: 147bp of DNA wrapped about an octamer of histone proteins. Nucleosomes are stable enough to organize the genome yet must be dynamically displaced and reassembled to allow access to the underlying DNA for transcription, replication, and DNA damage repair. Histone chaperones are a non-catalytic group of proteins that are central to the processes of nucleosome assembly and disassembly and thus the fluidity of the ever-changing chromatin landscape. Histone chaperones are responsible for binding the highly basic histone proteins, shielding them from non-specific interactions, facilitating their deposition onto DNA, and aiding in their eviction from DNA. Although most histone chaperones perform these common functions, recent structural studies of many different histone chaperones reveal that there are few commonalities in their folds. Importantly, sequence-based predictions show that histone chaperones are highly enriched in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and acidic stretches. In this review, we focus on the molecular mechanisms underpinning histone binding, selectivity, and regulation of these highly dynamic protein regions. We highlight new evidence suggesting that IDRs are often critical for histone chaperone function and play key roles in chromatin assembly and disassembly pathways.",J. Mol.

28609469,Muscle-relevant genes marked by stable H3K4me2/3 profiles and enriched MyoD binding during myogenic differentiation.,"Post-translational modifications of histones play a key role in the regulation of gene expression during development and differentiation. Numerous studies have shown the dynamics of combinatorial regulation by transcription factors and histone modifications, in the sense that different combinations lead to distinct expression outcomes. Here, we investigated gene regulation by stable enrichment patterns of histone marks H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 in combination with the chromatin binding of the muscle tissue-specific transcription factor MyoD during myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells. Using k-means clustering, we found that specific combinations of H3K4me2/3 profiles over and towards the gene body impact on gene expression and marks a subset of genes important for muscle development and differentiation. By further analysis, we found that the muscle key regulator MyoD was significantly enriched on this subset of genes and played a repressive role during myogenic differentiation. Among these genes, we identified the pluripotency gene Patz1, which is repressed during myogenic differentiation through direct binding of MyoD to promoter elements. These results point to the importance of integrating histone modifications and MyoD chromatin binding for coordinated gene activation and repression during myogenic differentiation.",PLoS ONE,2017,"['Cui H', 'Bansal V', 'Grunert M', 'Malecova B', ""Dall'Agnese A"", 'Latella L', 'Gatto S', 'Ryan T', 'Schulz K', 'Chen W', 'Dorn C', 'Puri PL', 'Sperling SR']"
28604753,let-7b and let-7c microRNAs promote histone H2B ubiquitylation and inhibit cell migration by targeting multiple components of the H2B deubiquitylation machinery.,"Monoubiquitylation of histone H2B (H2Bub1) is catalyzed mainly by the RNF20/RNF40 complex and erased by multiple deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs). H2Bub1 influences many aspects of chromatin function, including transcription regulation and DNA repair. Cancer cells often display reduced levels of H2Bub1, and this reduction may contribute to cancer progression. The let-7 family of microRNAs (miRNAs) comprises multiple members with reported tumor-suppressive features, whose expression is frequently downregulated in cancer. We now report that let-7b and let-7c can positively regulate cellular H2Bub1 levels. Overexpression of let-7b and let-7c in a variety of non-transformed and cancer-derived cell lines results in H2Bub1 elevation. The positive effect of let-7b and let-7c on H2Bub1 levels is achieved through targeting of multiple mRNAs, coding for distinct components of the H2B deubiquitylation machinery. Specifically, let-7b and let-7c bind directly and inhibit the mRNAs encoding the DUBs USP42 and USP44, and also the mRNA encoding the adapter protein ATXN7L3, which is part of the DUB module of the SAGA complex. RNF20 knockdown (KD) strongly reduces H2Bub1 levels and increases the migration of non-transformed mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer-derived cells. Remarkably, overexpression of let-7b, which partly counteracts the effect of RNF20 KD on H2Bub1 levels, also reverses the pro-migratory effect of RNF20 KD. Likewise, ATXN7L3 KD also increases H2Bub1 levels and reduces cell migration, and this anti-migratory effect is abolished by simultaneous KD of RNF20. Together, our findings uncover a novel function of let-7 miRNAs as regulators of H2B ubiquitylation, suggesting an additional mechanism whereby these miRNAs can exert their tumor-suppressive effects.",Oncogene,2017,"['Spolverini A', 'Fuchs G', 'Bublik DR', 'Oren M']"

We investigated expression profiles of OCT4 and NANOG during the early phases of neural differentiation using NT2/D1 cells induced by retinoic acid as an in vitro model system of human neurogenesis. We demonstrated decrease in OCT4 and NANOG mRNA and protein levels following exposure to retinoic acid. Next, by employing chromatin immunoprecipitation, we investigated profiles of selected H3 and H2B histone marks deposited on the promoters of the OCT4 and NANOG genes. We found decline in H3K4me3, H2BK5ac, and H2BK120ac on both promoters, which paralleled the decrease in OCT4 and NANOG expression. Moreover, we found that the H2BK16ac mark is differentially enriched on these two promoters, pointing to differences in epigenetic regulation of OCT4 and NANOG gene expression. Finally, based on our data, we suggest that the early response of pluripotency genes OCT4 and NANOG to the differentiation-inducing stimuli is mediated by dynamic changes in chromatin marks, while DNA methylation is acquired in the later stages of neurogenesis.",Biochemistry Mosc.,2017,"['Topalovic V', 'Schwirtlich M', 'Stevanovic M', 'Mojsin M']"
28587163,A Tox21 Approach to Altered Epigenetic Landscapes: Assessing Epigenetic Toxicity Pathways Leading to Altered Gene Expression and Oncogenic Transformation In Vitro.,"An emerging vision for toxicity testing in the 21st century foresees in vitro assays assuming the leading role in testing for chemical hazards, including testing for carcinogenicity. Toxicity will be determined by monitoring key steps in functionally validated molecular pathways, using tests designed to reveal chemically-induced perturbations that lead to adverse phenotypic endpoints in cultured human cells. Risk assessments would subsequently be derived from the causal in vitro endpoints and concentration vs. effect data extrapolated to human in vivo concentrations. Much direct experimental evidence now shows that disruption of epigenetic processes by chemicals is a carcinogenic mode of action that leads to altered gene functions playing causal roles in cancer initiation and progression. In assessing chemical safety, it would therefore be advantageous to consider an emerging class of carcinogens, the epigenotoxicants, with the ability to change chromatin and/or DNA marks by direct or indirect effects on the activities of enzymes (writers, erasers/editors, remodelers and readers) that convey the epigenetic information. Evidence is reviewed supporting a strategy for in vitro hazard identification of carcinogens that induce toxicity through disturbance of functional epigenetic pathways in human somatic cells, leading to inactivated tumour suppressor genes and carcinogenesis. In the context of human cell transformation models, these in vitro pathway measurements ensure high biological relevance to the apical endpoint of cancer. Four causal mechanisms participating in pathways to persistent epigenetic gene silencing were considered: covalent histone modification, nucleosome remodeling, non-coding RNA interaction and DNA methylation. Within these four interacting mechanisms, 25 epigenetic toxicity pathway components (SET1, MLL1, KDM5, G9A, SUV39H1, SETDB1, EZH2, JMJD3, CBX7, CBX8, BMI, SUZ12, HP1, MPP8, DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, TET1, MeCP2, SETDB2, BAZ2A, UHRF1, CTCF, HOTAIR and ANRIL) were found to have experimental evidence showing that functional perturbations played ""driver"" roles in human cellular transformation. Measurement of epigenotoxicants presents challenges for short-term carcinogenicity testing, especially in the high-throughput modes emphasized in the Tox21 chemicals testing approach.

28581500,Hyperactivation of HUSH complex function by Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease mutation in MORC2.,"Dominant mutations in the MORC2 gene have recently been shown to cause axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, but the cellular function of MORC2 is poorly understood. Here, through a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-mediated forward genetic screen, we identified MORC2 as an essential gene required for epigenetic silencing by the HUSH complex. HUSH recruits MORC2 to target sites in heterochromatin. We exploited a new method, differential viral accessibility (DIVA), to show that loss of MORC2 results in chromatin decompaction at these target loci, which is concomitant with a loss of H3K9me3 deposition and transcriptional derepression. The ATPase activity of MORC2 is critical for HUSH-mediated silencing, and the most common alteration affecting the ATPase domain in CMT patients (p.Arg252Trp) hyperactivates HUSH-mediated repression in neuronal cells. These data define a critical role for MORC2 in epigenetic silencing by the HUSH complex and provide a mechanistic basis underpinning the role of MORC2 mutations in CMT disease.",Nat.

YY1 acts both as a repressor and as an activator of gene expression. We have identified 23 individuals with de novo mutations or deletions of YY1 and phenotypic features that define a syndrome of cognitive impairment, behavioral alterations, intrauterine growth restriction, feeding problems, and various congenital malformations. Our combined clinical and molecular data define ""YY1 syndrome"" as a haploinsufficiency syndrome. Through immunoprecipitation of YY1-bound chromatin from affected individuals' cells with antibodies recognizing both ends of the protein, we show that YY1 deletions and missense mutations lead to a global loss of YY1 binding with a preferential retention at high-occupancy sites. Finally, we uncover a widespread loss of H3K27 acetylation in particular on the YY1-bound enhancers, underscoring a crucial role for YY1 in enhancer regulation.

28575455,Adolescent Alcohol Exposure-Induced Changes in Alpha-Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone and Neuropeptide Y Pathways via Histone Acetylation in the Brain During Adulthood.,"Background: Adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure causes long-lasting alterations in brain epigenetic mechanisms. Melanocortin and neuropeptide Y signaling interact and are affected by ethanol exposure in the brain. Here, the persistent effects of adolescent intermittent ethanol on alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone, melanocortin 4 receptor, and neuropeptide Y expression and their regulation by histone acetylation mechanisms were investigated in adulthood.
Methods: Male rats were exposed to adolescent intermittent ethanol (2 g/kg, i.p.) or volume-matched adolescent intermittent saline from postnatal days 28 to 41 and allowed to grow to postnatal day 92. Anxiety-like behaviors were measured by the elevated plus-maze test. Brain regions from adult rats were used to examine changes in alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone, melanocortin 4 receptor, and neuropeptide Y expression and the histone acetylation status of their promoters.
Results: Adolescent intermittent ethanol-exposed adult rats displayed anxiety-like behaviors and showed increased pro-opiomelanocortin mRNA levels in the hypothalamus and increased melanocortin 4 receptor mRNA levels in both the amygdala and hypothalamus compared with adolescent intermittent saline-exposed adult rats. The alpha-Melanocyte stimulating hormone and melanocortin 4 receptor protein levels were increased in the central and medial nucleus of the amygdala, paraventricular nucleus, and arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus in adolescent intermittent ethanol-exposed compared with adolescent intermittent saline-exposed adult rats. Neuropeptide Y protein levels were decreased in the central and medial nucleus of the amygdala of adolescent intermittent ethanol-exposed compared with adolescent intermittent saline-exposed adult rats. Histone H3K9/14 acetylation was decreased in the neuropeptide Y promoter in the amygdala but increased in the melanocortin 4 receptor gene promoter in the amygdala and the melanocortin 4 receptor and pro-opiomelanocortin promoters in the hypothalamus of adolescent intermittent ethanol-exposed adult rats compared with controls.
Conclusions: Increased melanocortin and decreased neuropeptide Y activity due to changes in histone acetylation in emotional brain circuitry may play a role in adolescent intermittent ethanol-induced anxiety phenotypes in adulthood.",Int.

28572115,Histone demethylase KDM5A regulates the ZMYND8-NuRD chromatin remodeler to promote DNA repair.,"Upon DNA damage, histone modifications are dynamically reshaped to accommodate DNA damage signaling and repair within chromatin. In this study, we report the identification of the histone demethylase KDM5A as a key regulator of the bromodomain protein ZMYND8 and NuRD (nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation) complex in the DNA damage response. We observe KDM5A-dependent H3K4me3 demethylation within chromatin near DNA double-strand break (DSB) sites. Mechanistically, demethylation of H3K4me3 is required for ZMYND8-NuRD binding to chromatin and recruitment to DNA damage. Functionally, KDM5A deficiency results in impaired transcriptional silencing and repair of DSBs by homologous recombination. Thus, this study identifies a crucial function for KDM5A in demethylating H3K4 to allow ZMYND8-NuRD to operate within damaged chromatin to repair DSBs.",J.

How this function is regulated locally and across the cell cycle to channel repair reactions toward non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in G1 and promote homology-directed repair (HDR) in S/G2 is insufficiently understood. Here, we show that the ability of 53BP1 to accumulate around DSBs declines as cells progress through S phase and reveal that the inverse relationship between 53BP1 recruitment and replicated chromatin is linked to the replication-coupled dilution of 53BP1's target mark H4K20me2. Consistently, premature maturation of post-replicative chromatin restores H4K20me2 and rescues 53BP1 accumulation on replicated chromatin. The H4K20me2-mediated chromatin association of 53BP1 thus represents an inbuilt mechanism to distinguish DSBs in pre- versus post-replicative chromatin, allowing for localized repair pathway choice decisions based on the availability of replication-generated template strands for HDR.",Cell Rep,2017,"['Pellegrino S', 'Michelena J', 'Teloni F', 'Imhof R', 'Altmeyer M']"
28564555,Holocarboxylase Synthetase: A Moonlighting Transcriptional Coregulator of Gene Expression and a Cytosolic Regulator of Biotin Utilization.,"The vitamin biotin is an essential nutrient for the metabolism and survival of all organisms owing to its function as a cofactor of enzymes collectively known as biotin-dependent carboxylases. These enzymes use covalently attached biotin as a vector to transfer a carboxyl group between donor and acceptor molecules during carboxylation reactions. In human cells, biotin-dependent carboxylases catalyze key reactions in gluconeogenesis, fatty acid synthesis, and amino acid catabolism. Biotin is attached to apocarboxylases by a biotin ligase: holocarboxylase synthetase (HCS) in mammalian cells and BirA in microbes. Despite their evolutionary distance, these proteins share structural and sequence similarities, underscoring their importance across all life forms. However, beyond its role in metabolism, HCS participates in the regulation of biotin utilization and acts as a nuclear transcriptional coregulator of gene expression. In this review, we discuss the function of HCS and biotin in metabolism and human disease, a putative role for the enzyme in histone biotinylation, and its participation as a nuclear factor in chromatin dynamics. We suggest that HCS be classified as a moonlighting protein, with two biotin-dependent cytosolic metabolic roles and a distinct biotin-independent nuclear coregulatory function.",Annu. Rev.

We report germline mutations in human Piwi (Hiwi) in patients with azoospermia that prevent its ubiquitination and degradation. By modeling such mutations in Piwi (Miwi) knockin mice, we demonstrate that the genetic defects are directly responsible for male infertility. Mechanistically, we show that MIWI binds the histone ubiquitin ligase RNF8 in a Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA)-independent manner, and MIWI stabilization sequesters RNF8 in the cytoplasm of late spermatids. The resulting aberrant sperm show histone retention, abnormal morphology, and severely compromised activity, which can be functionally rescued via blocking RNF8-MIWI interaction in spermatids with an RNF8-N peptide. Collectively, our findings identify Piwi as a factor in human infertility and reveal its role in regulating the histone-to-protamine exchange during spermiogenesis.",Cell,2017,"['Gou LT', 'Kang JY', 'Dai P', 'Wang X', 'Li F', 'Zhao S', 'Zhang M', 'Hua MM', 'Lu Y', 'Zhu Y', 'Li Z', 'Chen H', 'Wu LG', 'Li D', 'Fu XD', 'Li J', 'Shi HJ', 'Liu MF']"
28546430,Cross-talk between the H3K36me3 and H4K16ac histone epigenetic marks in DNA double-strand break repair.,"Post-translational modifications of histone proteins regulate numerous cellular processes. Among these modifications, trimethylation of lysine 36 in histone H3 (H3K36me3) and acetylation of lysine 16 in histone H4 (H4K16ac) have important roles in transcriptional regulation and DNA damage response signaling. However, whether these two epigenetic histone marks are mechanistically linked remains unclear. Here we discovered a new pathway through which H3K36me3 stimulates H4K16ac upon DNA double-strand break (DSB) induction in human cells. In particular, we examined, using Western blot analysis, the levels of H3K36me3 and H4K16ac in cells after exposure to various DSB-inducing agents, including neocarzinostatin, γ rays, and etoposide, and found that H3K36me3 and H4K16ac were both elevated in cells upon these treatments.

28542146,The role of extracellular histone in organ injury.,"Histones are intra-nuclear cationic proteins that are present in all eukaryotic cells and are highly conserved across species. Within the nucleus, they provide structural stability to chromatin and regulate gene expression. Histone may be released into the extracellular space in three forms: freely, as a DNA-bound nucleosome or as part of neutrophil extracellular traps, and all three can be detected in serum after significant cellular death such as sepsis, trauma, ischaemia/reperfusion injury and autoimmune disease. Once in the extracellular space, histones act as damage-associated molecular pattern proteins, activating the immune system and causing further cytotoxicity. They interact with Toll-like receptors (TLRs), complement and the phospholipids of cell membranes inducing endothelial and epithelial cytotoxicity, TLR2/TLR4/TLR9 activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine release via MyD88, NFκB and NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent pathways. Drugs that block the release of histone, neutralise circulating histone or block histone signal transduction provide significant protection from mortality in animal models of acute organ injury but warrant further research to inform future clinical applications.",Cell Death Dis,2017,"['Silk E', 'Zhao H', 'Weng H', 'Ma D']"
28539972,Site-specific regulation of histone H1 phosphorylation in pluripotent cell differentiation.,"BACKGROUND: Structural variation among histone H1 variants confers distinct modes of chromatin binding that are important for differential regulation of chromatin condensation, gene expression and other processes. Changes in the expression and genomic distributions of H1 variants during cell differentiation appear to contribute to phenotypic differences between cell types, but few details are known about the roles of individual H1 variants and the significance of their disparate capacities for phosphorylation. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of interphase phosphorylation at specific sites in individual H1 variants during the differentiation of pluripotent NT2 and mouse embryonic stem cells and characterized the kinases involved in regulating specific H1 variant phosphorylations in NT2 and HeLa cells.
RESULTS: Here, we show that the global levels of phosphorylation at H1.5-Ser18 (pS18-H1.5), H1.2/H1.5-Ser173 (pS173-H1.2/5) and H1.4-Ser187 (pS187-H1.4) are regulated differentially during pluripotent cell differentiation. Enrichment of pS187-H1.4 near the transcription start site of pluripotency factor genes in pluripotent cells is markedly reduced upon differentiation, whereas pS187-H1.4 levels at housekeeping genes are largely unaltered. Selective inhibition of CDK7 or CDK9 rapidly diminishes pS187-H1.4 levels globally and its enrichment at housekeeping genes, and similar responses were observed following depletion of CDK9. These data suggest that H1.4-S187 is a 
CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide strong evidence that H1 variant interphase phosphorylation is dynamically regulated in a site-specific and gene-specific fashion during pluripotent cell differentiation, and that enrichment of pS187-H1.4 at genes is positively related to their transcription. H1.4-S187 is likely to be a direct target of CDK9 during interphase, suggesting the possibility that this particular phosphorylation may contribute to the release of paused RNA pol II. In contrast, the other H1 variant phosphorylations we investigated appear to be mediated by distinct kinases and further analyses are needed to determine their functional significance.",Epigenetics Chromatin,2017,"['Liao R', 'Mizzen CA']"

Here, we present the crystal structure of the tandem plant homeodomain finger domain of human DPF2 at 1.6-Å resolution. We show that DPF2 interacts with the acetylated tails of both histones 3 and 4 via bipartite binding pockets on the DPF2 surface. Blocking these interactions through targeted mutagenesis of DPF2 abolishes its recruitment to target chromatin regions as well as its ability to prevent myeloid differentiation in vivo.

We connected super-enhancers and broad H3K4me3 domains in the K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line as well as the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line with chromatin interactions. Super-enhancers and broad H3K4me3 domains showed higher association with chromatin interactions than their typical counterparts. Interestingly, we identified a subset of super-enhancers that overlap with broad H3K4me3 domains and show high association with cancer-associated genes including tumor suppressor genes. Besides cell lines, we could observe chromatin interactions by a Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C)-based method, in primary human samples.

Given the complexity of ubiquitin conjugation due to the formation of poly-conjugates of different linkages, functional roles of linkage-specific ubiquitin modification at DNA damage sites are largely unclear. We identify that Lys11-linkage ubiquitin modification occurs at DNA damage sites in an ATM-dependent manner, and ubiquitin-modifying enzymes, including Ube2S E2-conjugating enzyme and RNF8 E3 ligase, are responsible for the assembly of Lys11-linkage conjugates on damaged chromatin, including histone H2A/H2AX. We show that RNF8- and Ube2S-dependent Lys11-linkage ubiquitin conjugation plays an important role in regulating DNA damage-induced transcriptional silencing, distinct from the role of Lys63-linkage ubiquitin in the recruitment of DNA damage repair proteins 53BP1 and BRCA1. Thus, our study highlights the importance of linkage-specific ubiquitination at DNA damage sites, and it reveals that Lys11-linkage ubiquitin modification plays a crucial role in the DNA damage response.",Mol.

28524856,Histone variant H3.3 orchestrates neural stem cell differentiation in the developing brain.,"During the brain development, the process of neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferation and differentiation is precisely regulated. The deficiency in the embryonic brain development will cause serious developmental disorders. Epigenetic modifications play critical roles in controlling proliferation and differentiation in different types of stem cells. Histone variants, as one of epigenetic regulators, have been reported to be associated with many bioprocesses. Among different variants, H3.3 is one of the important epigenetic regulators, but its role in embryonic NSCs remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that H3.3 is intrinsically required for NSCs proliferation and differentiation. Suppression of the H3.3 mediated by shRNAs causes the reduction of the PAX6-positive NSCs proliferation, and promotes the premature terminal mitosis and neuronal differentiation. Particularly, the level of the H4K16ac is selectively reduced in the H3.3 knockdown NSCs. We further confirm that H3.3 is directly interacted with the MOF, a specific H4K16 acetyltransferase. Interestingly, H3.3/MOF increases the level of H4K16ac by a mutual cooperation manner. However, the H3.3K36R mutant could not increase the level of H4K16ac. RNA-seq data show the GLI1, a transcriptional regulator, is downregulated in H3.3 knockdown NSCs. Furthermore, the neurogenesis phenotype of the GLI1 knockdown is consistent with the H3.3 knockdown. Overexpression of the H3.3, MOF, and GLI1 could rescue the abnormal phenotype caused by H3.3 knockdown in the embryonic brain, but H3.1 or H3.3K36R overexpression can not rescue it. Taken together, these results suggest that H3.3 cooperates with MOF to increase the level of the H4K16ac and the GLI1, and then regulates the NSCs proliferation and differentiation.",Cell Death Differ.,2017,"['Xia W', 'Jiao J']"
28523538,"MeCP2, A Modulator of Neuronal Chromatin Organization Involved in Rett Syndrome.","From an epigenetic perspective, the genomic chromatin organization of neurons exhibits unique features when compared to somatic cells. Methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), through its ability to bind to methylated DNA, seems to be a major player in regulating such unusual organization. An important contribution to this uniqueness stems from the intrinsically disordered nature of this highly abundant chromosomal protein in neurons. Upon its binding to methylated/hydroxymethylated DNA, MeCP2 is able to recruit a plethora of interacting protein and RNA partners. The final outcome is a highly specialized chromatin organization wherein linker histones (histones of the H1 family) and MeCP2 share an organizational role that dynamically changes during neuronal development and that it is still poorly understood. MeCP2 mutations alter its chromatin-binding dynamics and/or impair the ability of the protein to interact with some of its partners, resulting in Rett syndrome (RTT).

Here we show that, in pluripotent stem cells, certain histone marks and stem cell regulators remain associated with specific genomic regions of mitotic chromatin, a phenomenon known as mitotic bookmarking. Enhancers of stem cell-related genes are bookmarked by both H3K27ac and the master regulators OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4, while promoters of housekeeping genes retain high levels of mitotic H3K27ac in a cell-type invariant manner. Temporal degradation of OCT4 during mitotic exit compromises its ability both to maintain and induce pluripotency, suggesting that its regulatory function partly depends on its bookmarking activity. Together, our data document a widespread yet specific bookmarking by histone modifications and transcription factors promoting faithful and efficient propagation of stemness after cell division.",Cell Rep,2017,"['Liu Y', 'Pelham-Webb B', 'Di Giammartino DC', 'Li J', 'Kim D', 'Kita K', 'Saiz N', 'Garg V', 'Doane A', 'Giannakakou P', 'Hadjantonakis AK', 'Elemento O', 'Apostolou E']"
28514051,"The PPARγ-SETD8 axis constitutes an epigenetic, p53-independent checkpoint on p21-mediated cellular senescence.","Cellular senescence is a permanent proliferative arrest triggered by genome instability or aberrant growth stresses, acting as a protective or even tumor-suppressive mechanism. While several key aspects of gene regulation have been known to program this cessation of cell growth, the involvement of the epigenetic regulation has just emerged but remains largely unresolved. Using a systems approach that is based on targeted gene profiling, we uncovered known and novel chromatin modifiers with putative link to the senescent state of the cells. Among these, we identified SETD8 as a new target as well as a key regulator of the cellular senescence signaling. Knockdown of SETD8 triggered senescence induction in proliferative culture, irrespectively of the p53 status of the cells; ectopic expression of this epigenetic writer alleviated the extent doxorubicin-induced cellular senescence. This repressive effect of SETD8 in senescence was mediated by directly maintaining the silencing mark H4K20me1 at the locus of the senescence switch gene p21. Further in support of this regulatory link, depletion of p21 reversed this SETD8-mediated cellular senescence. Additionally, we found that PPARγ acts upstream and regulates SETD8 expression in proliferating cells. Downregulation of PPARγ coincided with the senescence induction, while its activation inhibited the progression of this process. Viewed together, our findings delineated a new epigenetic pathway through which the PPARγ-SETD8 axis directly silences p21 expression and consequently impinges on its senescence-inducing function. This implies that SETD8 may be part of a cell proliferation checkpoint mechanism and has important implications in antitumor therapeutics.",Aging Cell,2017,"['Shih CT', 'Chang YF', 'Chen YT', 'Ma CP', 'Chen HW', 'Yang CC', 'Lu JC', 'Tsai YS', 'Chen HC', 'Tan BC']"

Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and biochemistry, we show that RNF169 bridges ubiquitin and histone surfaces, stabilizing a pre-existing ubiquitin orientation in NCP-ubme to form a high-affinity complex. This conformational selection mechanism contrasts with the low-affinity binding mode of 53BP1, and it ensures 53BP1 displacement by RNF169 from NCP-ubme. We also show that RAD18 binds tightly to NCP-ubme through a ubiquitin-binding domain that contacts ubiquitin and nucleosome surfaces accessed by 53BP1. Our work uncovers diverse ubiquitin recognition mechanisms in the nucleosome, explaining how RNF168, RNF169, and RAD18 regulate 53BP1 chromatin recruitment and how specificity can be achieved in the recognition of a ubiquitin-modified substrate.",Mol.

28504305,Intranuclear and higher-order chromatin organization of the major histone gene cluster in breast cancer.,"Alterations in nuclear morphology are common in cancer progression. However, the degree to which gross morphological abnormalities translate into compromised higher-order chromatin organization is poorly understood. To explore the functional links between gene expression and chromatin structure in breast cancer, we performed RNA-seq gene expression analysis on the basal breast cancer progression model based on human MCF10A cells. Positional gene enrichment identified the major histone gene cluster at chromosome 6p22 as one of the most significantly upregulated (and not amplified) clusters of genes from the normal-like MCF10A to premalignant MCF10AT1 and metastatic MCF10CA1a cells. This cluster is subdivided into three sub-clusters of histone genes that are organized into hierarchical topologically associating domains (TADs). Interestingly, the sub-clusters of histone genes are located at TAD boundaries and interact more frequently with each other than the regions in-between them, suggesting that the histone sub-clusters form an active chromatin hub. The anchor sites of loops within this hub are occupied by CTCF, a known chromatin organizer. These histone genes are transcribed and processed at a specific sub-nuclear microenvironment termed the major histone locus body (HLB). While the overall chromatin structure of the major HLB is maintained across breast cancer progression, we detected alterations in its structure that may relate to gene expression. Importantly, breast tumor specimens also exhibit a coordinate pattern of upregulation across the major histone gene cluster.

The main findings suggest that DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling are active and deregulated in parathyroid tumors, cooperating with genetic alterations to drive the tumor phenotype: the tumor suppressors menin and parafibromin, involved in parathyroid tumorigenesis, interact with chromatin modifiers, defining distinct epigenetic derangements. Many epigenetic alterations identified in parathyroid tumors are common to those in human cancers; moreover, some aspects of the epigenetic profile resemble epigenetic features of embryonic stem cells. Epigenetic profile may contribute to define the heterogeneity of parathyroid tumors and to provide targets for new therapeutic approaches.",Mol. Cell.

28500859,Proteins with Site-Specific Lysine Methylation.,"As an important epigenetic mark, lysine methylations play critical roles in the regulation of both chromatin and non-chromatin proteins. There are three levels of lysine methylation, mono-, di-, and trimethylation. Each one has turned out to be biologically distinctive. For the biochemical characterization of proteins with lysine methylation, multiple chemical biology methods have been developed. This concept article will highlight these developments and their applications in epigenetic investigation of protein functions.",Chemistry,2017,"['Wang ZA', 'Liu WR']"
28500727,Biological function and histone recognition of family IV bromodomain-containing proteins.,"Bromodomain proteins function as epigenetic readers that recognize acetylated histone tails to facilitate the transcription of target genes. There are approximately 60 known human bromodomains, which are divided into eight sub-families based on structural conservation. The bromodomain-containing proteins in family IV include seven members (BRPF1, BRPF2, BRPF3, BRD7, BRD9, ATAD2, and ATAD2b). The bromodomains of each of these proteins recognize and bind acetyllysine residues on histone tails protruding from the nucleosome. However, the histone marks recognized by each bromodomain protein can be very different. The BRPF1 subunit of the MOZ histone acetyltransferase (HAT) recognizes acetylated histones H2AK5ac, H4K12ac, H3K14ac, H4K8ac, and H4K5ac. While the bromodomain of BRD7, a member of the SWI/SNF complex, was shown to preferentially recognize acetylated histones H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H4K8ac, H4K12ac, and H4K16ac. The bromodomains of BRPF2 and BRPF3 have similar sequences, and function as part of the HBO1 HAT complex, but there is limited data on which histone ligands they bind. Similarly, there is little known about the histone targets of the BRD9 and ATAD2b bromodomain proteins. Interestingly, the ATAD2 bromodomain was recently shown to preferentially bind to the di-acetylated H4K5acK12ac mark found in newly synthesized histones following DNA replication. However, despite the physiological importance of the family IV bromodomains, little is known about how they function at the molecular or atomic level. In this review, we summarize our understanding of how family IV bromodomains recognize and select for acetyllysine marks and discuss the importance of acetylated histone recognition for their biological functions.",J.

28499349,Epimetheus - a multi-profile normalizer for epigenomic sequencing data.,"BACKGROUND: Exponentially increasing numbers of NGS-based epigenomic datasets in public repositories like GEO constitute an enormous source of information that is invaluable for integrative and comparative studies of gene regulatory mechanisms. One of today's challenges for such studies is to identify functionally informative local and global patterns of chromatin states in order to describe the regulatory impact of the epigenome in normal cell physiology and in case of pathological aberrations. Critically, the most preferred Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation-Sequencing (ChIP-Seq) is inherently prone to significant variability between assays, which poses significant challenge on comparative studies. One challenge concerns data normalization to adjust sequencing depth variation.
RESULTS: Currently existing tools either apply linear scaling corrections and/or are restricted to specific genomic regions, which can be prone to biases. To overcome these restrictions without any external biases, we developed Epimetheus, a genome-wide quantile-based multi-profile normalization tool for histone modification data and related datasets.
CONCLUSIONS: Epimetheus has been successfully used to normalize epigenomics data in previous studies on X inactivation in breast cancer and in integrative studies of neuronal cell fate acquisition and tumorigenic transformation; Epimetheus is freely available to the scientific community.",BMC Bioinformatics,2017,"['Saleem MM', 'Mendoza-Parra MA', 'Cholley PE', 'Blum M', 'Gronemeyer H']"
28497787,Locus-specific histone deacetylation using a synthetic CRISPR-Cas9-based HDAC.,"Efforts to manipulate locus-specific histone acetylation to assess their causal role in gene expression and cellular and behavioural phenotypes have been impeded by a lack of experimental tools. The Cas9 nuclease has been adapted to target epigenomic modifications, but a detailed description of the parameters of such synthetic epigenome remodellers is still lacking. Here we describe a Cas9-based histone deacetylase (HDAC) and the design principles required to achieve locus-specific histone deacetylation. We assess its range of activity and specificity, and analyse target gene expression in two different cell types to investigate cellular context-dependent effects. Our findings demonstrate that the chromatin environment is an important element to consider when utilizing this synthetic HDAC.",Nat Commun,2017,"['Kwon DY', 'Zhao YT', 'Lamonica JM', 'Zhou Z']"
28497778,PTEN regulates glioblastoma oncogenesis through chromatin-associated complexes of DAXX and histone H3.3.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal type of human brain cancer, where deletions and mutations in the tumour suppressor gene PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) are frequent events and are associated with therapeutic resistance. Herein, we report a novel chromatin-associated function of PTEN in complex with the histone chaperone DAXX and the histone variant H3.3. We show that PTEN interacts with DAXX and, in turn PTEN directly regulates oncogene expression by modulating DAXX-H3.3 association on the chromatin, independently of PTEN enzymatic activity. Furthermore, DAXX inhibition specifically suppresses tumour growth and improves the survival of orthotopically engrafted mice implanted with human PTEN-deficient glioma samples, associated with global H3.3 genomic distribution changes leading to upregulation of tumour suppressor genes and downregulation of oncogenes. Moreover, DAXX expression anti-correlates with PTEN expression in GBM patient samples. Since loss of chromosome 10 and PTEN are common events in cancer, this synthetic growth defect mediated by DAXX suppression represents a therapeutic opportunity to inhibit tumorigenesis specifically in the context of PTEN deletion.",Nat Commun,2017,"['Benitez JA', 'Ma J', ""D'Antonio M"", 'Boyer A', 'Camargo MF', 'Zanca C', 'Kelly S', 'Khodadadi-Jamayran A', 'Jameson NM', 'Andersen M', 'Miletic H', 'Saberi S', 'Frazer KA', 'Cavenee WK', 'Furnari FB']"

This long non-coding RNA recruits epigenetic silencers for cis-acting repression of its neighbouring Methionine adenosyltransferase 2A gene. It now emerges that PARTICLE operates as a trans-acting mediator of DNA and histone lysine methylation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and immunological evidence established elevated PARTICLE expression linked to increased histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation. Live-imaging of dbroccoli-PARTICLE revealing its dynamic association with DNA methyltransferase 1 was confirmed by flow cytometry, immunoprecipitation and direct competitive binding interaction through electrophoretic mobility shift assay.

Chromatin-remodeling complexes and post-translational histone modifications likely play key roles in HIV-1 reactivation, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. We performed an RNAi-based screen of human lysine methyltransferases and identified the SET and MYND domain-containing protein 2 (SMYD2) as an enzyme that regulates HIV-1 latency.

28488757,Stimulation of Pol III-dependent 5S rRNA and U6 snRNA gene expression by AP-1 transcription factors.,"RNA polymerase III transcribes structurally diverse group of essential noncoding RNAs including 5S ribosomal RNA (5SrRNA) and U6 snRNA. These noncoding RNAs are involved in RNA processing and ribosome biogenesis, thus, coupling Pol III activity to the rate of protein synthesis, cell growth, and proliferation. Even though a few Pol II-associated transcription factors have been reported to participate in Pol III-dependent transcription, its activation by activator protein 1 (AP-1) factors, c-Fos and c-Jun, has remained unexplored. Here, we show that c-Fos and c-Jun bind to specific sites in the regulatory regions of 5S rRNA (type I) and U6 snRNA (type III) gene promoters and stimulate their transcription. Our chromatin immunoprecipitation studies suggested that endogenous AP-1 factors bind to their cognate promoter elements during the G1/S transition of cell cycle apparently synchronous with Pol III transcriptional activity. Furthermore, the interaction of c-Jun with histone acetyltransferase p300 promoted the recruitment of p300/CBP complex on the promoters and facilitated the occupancy of Pol III transcriptional machinery via histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling. The findings of our study, together, suggest that AP-1 factors are novel regulators of Pol III-driven 5S rRNA and U6 snRNA expression with a potential role in cell proliferation.",FEBS J.,2017,"['Ahuja R', 'Kumar V']"
28486547,HAT2 mediates histone H4K4 acetylation and affects micrococcal nuclease sensitivity of chromatin in Leishmania donovani.,"Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as acetylation and methylation are known to affect chromatin higher order structures. Primary targets of these modifications include basic residues present at N-terminus tail region of core histones. Four histone acetyltransferase (HAT) genes have been identified in trypanosomatids. HAT1, HAT3 and HAT4 of Leishmania donovani have been partially characterized. However, there is no report about HAT2 of Leishmania donovani. Lysine residues present on the N-terminal tail of Leishmania donovani histone H4 are conserved in other trypanosomatids and humans. PTMs of lysines modulate various functions at chromatin level. The four histone acetyltransferases encoded in Leishmania genome were over-expressed to analyse their functional activity. All four HATs were found actively acetylating core histones H3/H4. Similar to L. donovani HAT3 and HAT4, HAT2 was found to be a member of MYST family protein and have SAS2 type domain. Over-expression of HAT2 significantly increases acetylation of H4K4. To analyse the effect of HAT2 over-expression on chromatin accessibility, micrococcal nuclease digestion assay was performed. MNase digestion resulted in a higher proportion of the mononucleosomes and dinucleosomes in HAT2 over-expressing cells as compared to WT L. donovani cells. Acetylation of lysine-4 neutralizes the amino terminal region of histone H4. This weakens its interaction with neighbouring nucleosomes and the linker DNA. HAT2 over-expression in L. donovani resulted in highly accessible chromatin suggesting chromatin decondensation. HAT2 may have an important role to play in global regulation of transcription in L. donovani. Better understanding of these epigenetic determinants of parasite would help in designing novel therapeutic strategies.",PLoS ONE,2017,"['Jha PK', 'Khan MI', 'Mishra A', 'Das P', 'Sinha KK']"
28485572,Citrullination/Methylation Crosstalk on Histone H3 Regulates ER-Target Gene Transcription.,"Posttranslational modifications of histone tails are a key contributor to epigenetic regulation. Histone H3 Arg26 and Lys27 are both modified by multiple enzymes, and their modifications have profound effects on gene expression. Citrullination of H3R26 by PAD2 and methylation of H3K27 by PRC2 have opposing downstream impacts on gene regulation; H3R26 citrullination activates gene expression, and H3K27 methylation represses gene expression. Both of these modifications are drivers of a variety of cancers, and their writer enzymes, PAD2 and EZH2, are the targets of drug therapies. After biochemical and cell-based analysis of these modifications, a negative crosstalk interaction is observed. Methylation of H3K27 slows citrullination of H3R26 30-fold, whereas citrullination of H3R26 slows methylation 30,000-fold. Examination of the mechanism of this crosstalk interaction uncovered a change in structure of the histone tail upon citrullination which prevents methylation by the PRC2 complex. This mechanism of crosstalk is reiterated in cell lines using knockdowns and inhibitors of both enzymes. Based our data, we propose a model in which, after H3 Cit26 formation, H3K27 demethylases are recruited to the chromatin to activate transcription. In total, our studies support the existence of crosstalk between citrullination of H3R26 and methylation of H3K27.",ACS Chem.

28483516,Down-regulation of ARID1A is sufficient to initiate neoplastic transformation along with epigenetic reprogramming in non-tumorigenic endometriotic cells.,"The chromatin remodeler AT-Rich Interactive Domain 1A (ARID1A) is frequently mutated in ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) and endometriosis precursor lesions. Here, we show that knocking down ARID1A in an immortalized endometriosis cell line is sufficient to induce phenotypic changes indicative of neoplastic transformation as evidenced by higher efficiency of anchorage-independent growth, increased propensity to adhere to collagen, and greater capacity to invade basement membrane extract in vitro. ARID1A knockdown is associated with expression dysregulation of 99 target genes, and many of these expression changes are also observed in primary OCCC tissues. Further, pathway analysis indicates these genes fall within networks highly relevant to tumorigenesis including integrin and paxillin pathways. We demonstrate that the down-regulation of ARID1A does not markedly alter global chromatin accessibility or DNA methylation but unexpectedly, we find strong increases in the active H3K27ac mark in promoter regions and decreases of H3K27ac at potential enhancers. Taken together, these data provide evidence that ARID1A mutation can be an early stage event in the oncogenic transformation of endometriosis cells giving rise to OCCC.",Cancer Lett.,2017,"['Lakshminarasimhan R', 'Andreu-Vieyra C', 'Lawrenson K', 'Duymich CE', 'Gayther SA', 'Liang G', 'Jones PA']"
28475873,Structure and Dynamics of a 197 bp Nucleosome in Complex with Linker Histone H1.,"Linker histones associate with nucleosomes to promote the formation of higher-order chromatin structure, but the underlying molecular details are unclear. We investigated the structure of a 197 bp nucleosome bearing symmetric 25 bp linker DNA arms in complex with vertebrate linker histone H1. We determined electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) and crystal structures of unbound and H1-bound nucleosomes and validated these structures by site-directed protein cross-linking and hydroxyl radical footprinting experiments. Histone H1 shifts the conformational landscape of the nucleosome by drawing the two linkers together and reducing their flexibility. The H1 C-terminal domain (CTD) localizes primarily to a single linker, while the H1 globular domain contacts the nucleosome dyad and both linkers, associating more closely with the CTD-distal linker. These findings reveal that H1 imparts a strong degree of asymmetry to the nucleosome, which is likely to influence the assembly and architecture of higher-order structures.",Mol.

28475736,CHD1 regulates cell fate determination by activation of differentiation-induced genes.,"The coordinated temporal and spatial activation of gene expression is essential for proper stem cell differentiation. The Chromodomain Helicase DNA-binding protein 1 (CHD1) is a chromatin remodeler closely associated with transcription and nucleosome turnover downstream of the transcriptional start site (TSS). In this study, we show that CHD1 is required for the induction of osteoblast-specific gene expression, extracellular-matrix mineralization and ectopic bone formation in vivo. Genome-wide occupancy analyses revealed increased CHD1 occupancy around the TSS of differentiation-activated genes. Furthermore, we observed that CHD1-dependent genes are mainly induced during osteoblast differentiation and are characterized by higher levels of CHD1 occupancy around the TSS. Interestingly, CHD1 depletion resulted in increased pausing of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) and decreased H2A.Z occupancy close to the TSS, but not at enhancer regions. These findings reveal a novel role for CHD1 during osteoblast differentiation and provide further insights into the intricacies of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms controlling cell fate determination.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2017,"['Baumgart SJ', 'Najafova Z', 'Hossan T', 'Xie W', 'Nagarajan S', 'Kari V', 'Ditzel N', 'Kassem M', 'Johnsen SA']"
28475175,Nucleosome eviction along with H3K9ac deposition enhances Sox2 binding during human neuroectodermal commitment.,"Neuroectoderm is an important neural precursor. However, chromatin remodeling and its epigenetic regulatory roles during the differentiation of human neuroectodermal cells (hNECs) from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) remain largely unexplored. Here, we obtained hNECs through directed differentiation from hESCs, and determined chromatin states in the two cell types. Upon differentiation, H2A.Z-mediated nucleosome depletion leads to an open chromatin structure in promoters and upregulates expression of neuroectodermal genes. Increase in H3K9ac signals and decrease in H3K27me3 signals in promoters result in an active chromatin state and activate neuroectodermal genes. Conversely, decrease in H3K9ac signals and increase in H3K27me3 signals in promoters repress pluripotency genes. Moreover, H3K9ac signals facilitate the pluripotency factor Sox2 binding to target sites unique to hNECs. Knockdown of the acetyltransferase Kat2b erases H3K9ac signals, disrupts Sox2 binding, and fails the differentiation. Our results demonstrate a hierarchy of epigenetic regulation of gene expression during the differentiation of hNECs from hESCs through chromatin remodeling.",Cell Death Differ.,2017,"['Du Y', 'Liu Z', 'Cao X', 'Chen X', 'Chen Z', 'Zhang X', 'Zhang X', 'Jiang C']"
28472346,A c-Myb mutant causes deregulated differentiation due to impaired histone binding and abrogated pioneer factor function.,"The transcription factor c-Myb is involved in early differentiation and proliferation of haematopoietic cells, where it operates as a regulator of self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation. Deregulated c-Myb plays critical roles in leukaemias and other human cancers. Due to its role as a master regulator, we hypothesized it might function as a pioneer transcription factor. Our approach to test this was to analyse a mutant of c-Myb, D152V, previously reported to cause haematopoietic defects in mice by an unknown mechanism. Our transcriptome data from K562 cells indicates that this mutation specifically affects c-Myb's ability to regulate genes involved in differentiation, causing failure in c-Myb's ability to block differentiation. Furthermore, we see a major effect of this mutation in assays where chromatin opening is involved. We show that each repeat in the minimal DNA-binding domain of c-Myb binds to histones and that D152V disrupts histone binding of the third repeat. ATAC-seq data indicates this mutation impairs the ability of c-Myb to cause chromatin opening at specific sites. Taken together, our findings support that c-Myb acts as a pioneer factor and show that D152V impairs this function. The D152V mutant is the first mutant of a transcription factor specifically destroying pioneer factor function.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2017,"['Fuglerud BM', 'Lemma RB', 'Wanichawan P', 'Sundaram AYM', 'Eskeland R', 'Gabrielsen OS']"
28465257,5-Fluorouracil targets histone acetyltransferases p300/CBP in the treatment of colorectal cancer.,"Although 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is known to interfere with the synthesis of ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid, the mechanism underlying its therapeutic efficacy in colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been fully elucidated. We aimed to investigate the influence of 5-FU on histone acetylation, a well-established anti-cancer target, to reveal novel pharmacological effects of 5-FU and their significance for CRC therapy. Results demonstrated that 5-FU induces global histone de-acetylation in multiple CRC cell lines. We identified that 5-FU reduces the binding ability of histone acetyltransferases p300 and CBP to chromatin, and induces their degradation through lysosome. Further work revealed that the degradation of p300/CBP induced by 5-FU was dependent on chaperone-mediated autophagy, mediated by heat-shock cognate protein 70 kDa (hsc70) and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP2A). Moreover, the degradation of p300/CBP is relevant to cellular resistance to 5-FU, since blocking the degradation enhances 5-FU's cytotoxicity in CRC cells. From clinical data, we demonstrated that low expression of p300/CBP in CRC tissue was closely associated with poor clinical response to 5-FU based-chemotherapy, based on the analysis of 262 colorectal samples from the patients receiving 5-FU treatment: compared to cases with high expression of p300/CBP, those with low expression had lower long-term disease-free survival rate and increased early-progression. These results elucidate a novel pharmacological effect of 5-FU involving global histone de-acetylation by promoting the degradation of p300/CBP, and highlights p300 and CBP as promising predictors of chemo-sensitivity to 5-FU treatment.",Cancer Lett.,2017,"['Du C', 'Huang D', 'Peng Y', 'Yao Y', 'Zhao Y', 'Yang Y', 'Wang H', 'Cao L', 'Zhu WG', 'Gu J']"

28463415,"Using Chromatin Immunoprecipitation in Toxicology: A Step-by-Step Guide to Increasing Efficiency, Reducing Variability, and Expanding Applications.","Histone modifications work in concert with DNA methylation to regulate cellular structure, function, and response to environmental stimuli. More than 130 unique histone modifications have been described to date, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) allows for the exploration of their associations with the regulatory regions of target genes and other DNA/chromatin-associated proteins across the genome. Many variations of ChIP have been developed in the 30 years since its earliest version came into use, which makes it challenging for users to integrate the procedure into their research programs. Furthermore, the differences in ChIP protocols can confound efforts to increase reproducibility across studies. The streamlined ChIP procedure presented here can be readily applied to samples from a wide range of in vitro studies (cell lines and primary cells) and clinical samples (peripheral leukocytes) in toxicology.

28460463,SET oncoprotein accumulation regulates transcription through DNA demethylation and histone hypoacetylation.,"Epigenetic modifications are essential in the control of normal cellular processes and cancer development. DNA methylation and histone acetylation are major epigenetic modifications involved in gene transcription and abnormal events driving the oncogenic process. SET protein accumulates in many cancer types, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC); SET is a member of the INHAT complex that inhibits gene transcription associating with histones and preventing their acetylation. We explored how SET protein accumulation impacts on the regulation of gene expression, focusing on DNA methylation and histone acetylation. DNA methylation profile of 24 tumour suppressors evidenced that SET accumulation decreased DNA methylation in association with loss of 5-methylcytidine, formation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and increased TET1 levels, indicating an active DNA demethylation mechanism. However, the expression of some suppressor genes was lowered in cells with high SET levels, suggesting that loss of methylation is not the main mechanism modulating gene expression. SET accumulation also downregulated the expression of 32 genes of a panel of 84 transcription factors, and SET directly interacted with chromatin at the promoter of the downregulated genes, decreasing histone acetylation. Gene expression analysis after cell treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA) and Trichostatin A (TSA) revealed that histone acetylation reversed transcription repression promoted by SET. These results suggest a new function for SET in the regulation of chromatin dynamics. In addition, TSA diminished both SET protein levels and SET capability to bind to gene promoter, suggesting that administration of epigenetic modifier agents could be efficient to reverse SET phenotype in cancer.",Oncotarget,2017,"['Almeida LO', 'Neto MPC', 'Sousa LO', 'Tannous MA', 'Curti C', 'Leopoldino AM']"

28445939,Epigenetic therapy with inhibitors of histone methylation suppresses DNA damage signaling and increases glioma cell radiosensitivity.,"Radiation therapy is widely used to treat human malignancies, but many tumor types, including gliomas, exhibit significant radioresistance. Radiation therapy creates DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), and DSB repair is linked to rapid changes in epigenetic modifications, including increased histone methylation. This increased histone methylation recruits DNA repair proteins which can then alter the local chromatin structure and promote repair. Consequently, combining inhibitors of specific histone methyltransferases with radiation therapy may increase tumor radiosensitivity, particularly in tumors with significant therapeutic resistance. Here, we demonstrate that inhibitors of the H4K20 methyltransferase SETD8 (UNC-0379) and the H3K9 methyltransferase G9a (BIX-01294) are effective radiosensitizers of human glioma cells. UNC-0379 blocked H4K20 methylation and reduced recruitment of the 53BP1 protein to DSBs, although this loss of 53BP1 caused only limited changes in radiosensitivity. In contrast, loss of H3K9 methylation through G9a inhibition with BIX-01294 increased radiosensitivity of a panel of glioma cells (SER2Gy range: 1.5 - 2.9). Further, loss of H3K9 methylation reduced DSB signaling dependent on H3K9, including reduced activation of the Tip60 acetyltransferase, loss of ATM signaling and reduced phosphorylation of the KAP-1 repressor. In addition, BIX-0194 inhibited DSB repair through both the homologous recombination and nonhomologous end-joining pathways. Inhibition of G9a and loss of H3K9 methylation is therefore an effective approach for increasing radiosensitivity of glioma cells. These results suggest that combining inhibitors of histone methyltransferases which are critical for DSB repair with radiation therapy may provide a new therapeutic route for sensitizing gliomas and other tumors to radiation therapy.",Oncotarget,2017,"['Gursoy-Yuzugullu O', 'Carman C', 'Serafim RB', 'Myronakis M', 'Valente V', 'Price BD']"
28445736,Systematic Epigenomic Analysis Reveals Chromatin States Associated with Melanoma Progression.,"The extent and nature of epigenomic changes associated with melanoma progression is poorly understood. Through systematic epigenomic profiling of 35 epigenetic modifications and transcriptomic analysis, we define chromatin state changes associated with melanomagenesis by using a cell phenotypic model of non-tumorigenic and tumorigenic states. Computation of specific chromatin state transitions showed loss of histone acetylations and H3K4me2/3 on regulatory regions proximal to specific cancer-regulatory genes in important melanoma-driving cell signaling pathways. Importantly, such acetylation changes were also observed between benign nevi and malignant melanoma human tissues. Intriguingly, only a small fraction of chromatin state transitions correlated with expected changes in gene expression patterns. Restoration of acetylation levels on deacetylated loci by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors selectively blocked excessive proliferation in tumorigenic cells and human melanoma cells, suggesting functional roles of observed chromatin state transitions in driving hyperproliferative phenotype. Through these results, we define functionally relevant chromatin states associated with melanoma progression.",Cell Rep,2017,"['Fiziev P', 'Akdemir KC', 'Miller JP', 'Keung EZ', 'Samant NS', 'Sharma S', 'Natale CA', 'Terranova CJ', 'Maitituoheti M', 'Amin SB', 'Martinez-Ledesma E', 'Dhamdhere M', 'Axelrad JB', 'Shah A', 'Cheng CS', 'Mahadeshwar H', 'Seth S', 'Barton MC', 'Protopopov A', 'Tsai KY', 'Davies MA', 'Garcia BA', 'Amit I', 'Chin L', 'Ernst J', 'Rai K']"

RECENT FINDINGS: Over half of MM patients have mutations in genes encoding epigenetic modifier enzymes. The DNA methylation profile of MM is related to the stage of the disease and certain classes of mutations in epigenetic modifiers are more prevalent upon disease relapse, suggesting a role in disease progression.

28441146,Epigenetic regulation of glucose metabolism.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Glucose metabolism is a central process in mammalian energy homeostasis. Its deregulation is a key factor in development of metabolic disease like diabetes and cancer. In recent decades, our understanding of gene regulation at the signaling, chromatin and posttranscriptional levels has seen dramatic developments.
RECENT FINDINGS: A number of epigenetic mechanisms that do not affect the genetic code can be assessed with new technologies. However, increasing complexity becomes a major challenge for translation into clinical application.
SUMMARY: The current review provides an update of transcriptional control of glucose metabolism, focusing on epigenetic regulators, DNA-methylation, histone modifications and noncoding RNAs. Recent studies heavily support the importance of those mechanisms for future therapeutics and preventive efforts for metabolic diseases.",Curr Opin Clin Nutr Metab Care,2017,"['Sharma S', 'Kriebel J', 'Grallert H']"
28440495,Relationship between epigenetic changes in Wnt antagonists and acute leukemia.,"The present study was designed to investigate the relationship among epigenetic changes in Wnt antagonists, histone H4K20me1 and the expression of tumor-suppressor genes in acute leukemia (AL) to better understand the pathogenesis of leukemia. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of Wnt antagonists (Wnt5a, HDPR1, DKK1 and DKK3) in patients with AL and in normal controls; pyrophosphate sequencing was performed to detect the methylation status of the Wnt5a promoter; and western blotting was performed to detect the overall expression levels of Wnt5a protein and histone H4K20me1 in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and in normal controls. The relationship between Wnt5a protein expression and histone H4K20me1 was analyzed. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR (ChIP-qPCR) was performed to investigate the recruitment of H4K20me1 and SET8 to the Wnt5a promoter and coding regions. Our results demonstrated that the expression levels of Wnt antagonists were generally low in AML, but showed differential expression in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). In most cases of AML, methylation of the Wnt5a promoter was observed and Wnt5a protein expression was low. In some cases of AML, the overall level of H4K20me1 protein was higher than that in normal controls. In addition, Wnt5a expression was positively correlated with H4K20me1 expression and was unrelated to the methylation status of its promoter. Moreover, H4K20me1 and SET8 were enriched in the Wnt5a promoter region and coding region. By contrast, Wnt5a expression was unrelated to H4K20me1 expression in normal controls. Moreover, we observed that the methylation of Wnt antagonists was often found in patients with AL, particularly those with AML, whereas the extent of methylation was variable in ALL patients. Wnt5a expression was positively correlated with the enrichment of H4K20me1 and SET8 at the Wnt5a promoter and coding regions. H4K20me1 increased Wnt5a expression by promoting transcription initiation and elongation.",Oncol.

28440295,KDM3 epigenetically controls tumorigenic potentials of human colorectal cancer stem cells through Wnt/β-catenin signalling.,"Human colorectal cancer stem cells (CSCs) are tumour initiating cells that can self-renew and are highly tumorigenic and chemoresistant. While genetic mutations associated with human colorectal cancer development are well-known, little is known about how and whether epigenetic factors specifically contribute to the functional properties of human colorectal CSCs. Here we report that the KDM3 family of histone demethylases plays an important role in tumorigenic potential and survival of human colorectal CSCs by epigenetically activating Wnt target gene transcription. The depletion of KDM3 inhibits tumorigenic growth and chemoresistance of human colorectal CSCs. Mechanistically, KDM3 not only directly erases repressive H3K9me2 marks, but also helps to recruit histone methyltransferase MLL1 to promote H3K4 methylation, thereby promoting Wnt target gene transcription. Our results suggest that KDM3 is a critical epigenetic factor in Wnt signalling that orchestrates chromatin changes and transcription in human colorectal CSCs, identifying potential therapeutic targets for effective elimination of CSCs.",Nat Commun,2017,"['Li J', 'Yu B', 'Deng P', 'Cheng Y', 'Yu Y', 'Kevork K', 'Ramadoss S', 'Ding X', 'Li X', 'Wang CY']"
28434841,Transcriptional Dependencies in Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma.,"Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a fatal pediatric cancer with limited therapeutic options. The majority of cases of DIPG exhibit a mutation in histone-3 (H3K27M) that results in oncogenic transcriptional aberrancies. We show here that DIPG is vulnerable to transcriptional disruption using bromodomain inhibition or CDK7 blockade. Targeting oncogenic transcription through either of these methods synergizes with HDAC inhibition, and DIPG cells resistant to HDAC inhibitor therapy retain sensitivity to CDK7 blockade. Identification of super-enhancers in DIPG provides insights toward the cell of origin, highlighting oligodendroglial lineage genes, and reveals unexpected mechanisms mediating tumor viability and invasion, including potassium channel function and EPH receptor signaling. The findings presented demonstrate transcriptional vulnerabilities and elucidate previously unknown mechanisms of DIPG pathobiology.",Cancer Cell,2017,"['Nagaraja S', 'Vitanza NA', 'Woo PJ', 'Taylor KR', 'Liu F', 'Zhang L', 'Li M', 'Meng W', 'Ponnuswami A', 'Sun W', 'Ma J', 'Hulleman E', 'Swigut T', 'Wysocka J', 'Tang Y', 'Monje M']"
28433418,Binge alcohol alters PNPLA3 levels in liver through epigenetic mechanism involving histone H3 acetylation.,"The human PNPLA3 (patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3) gene codes for a protein which is highly expressed in adipose tissue and liver, and is implicated in lipid homeostasis. While PNPLA3 protein contains regions homologous to functional lipolytic proteins, the regulation of its tissue expression is reflective of lipogenic genes. A naturally occurring genetic variant of PNPLA3 in humans has been linked to increased susceptibility to alcoholic liver disease. We have examined the modulatory effect of alcohol on PNPLA3 protein and mRNA expression as well as the association of its gene promoter with acetylated histone H3K9 by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay in rat hepatocytes in vitro, and in vivo in mouse and rat models of acute binge, chronic, and chronic followed by acute binge ethanol administration. Protein expression of PNPLA3 was significantly increased by alcohol in all three models used. PNPLA3 mRNA also increased, albeit to a varying degree. ChIP assay using H3AcK9 antibody showed increased association with the promoter of PNPLA3 in hepatocytes and in mouse liver. This was less evident in rat livers in vivo except under chronic treatment. It is concluded for the first time that histone acetylation plays a role in the modulation of PNPLA3 levels in the liver exposed to binge ethanol both in vitro and in vivo.",Alcohol,2017,"['Restrepo RJ', 'Lim RW', 'Korthuis RJ', 'Shukla SD']"
28431792,Changes to histone modifications following prenatal alcohol exposure: An emerging picture.,"Epigenetic mechanisms are important for facilitating gene-environment interactions in many disease etiologies, including Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Extensive research into the role of DNA methylation and miRNAs in animal models has illuminated the complex role of these mechanisms in FASD. In contrast, histone modifications have not been as well researched, due in part to being less stable than DNA methylation and less well-characterized in disease. It is now apparent that even changes in transient marks can have profound effects if they alter developmental trajectories. In addition, many histone methylations are now known to be relatively stable and can propagate themselves. As technologies and knowledge have advanced, a small group has investigated the role of histone modifications in FASD. Here, we synthesize the data on the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on histone modifications. Several key points are evident. AS with most alcohol-induced outcomes, timing and dosage differences yield variable effects. Nevertheless, these studies consistently find enrichment of H3K9ac, H3K27me2,3, and H3K9me2, and increased expression of histone acetyltransferases and methyltransferases. The consistency of these alterations may implicate them as key mechanisms underlying FASD. Histone modification changes do not often correlate with gene expression changes, though some important examples exist. Encouragingly, attempts to reproduce specific histone modification changes are very often successful. We comment on possible directions for future studies, focusing on further exploration of current trends, expansion of time-point and dosage regimes, and evaluation of biomarker potential.",Alcohol,2017,"['Chater-Diehl EJ', 'Laufer BI', 'Singh SM']"
28428255,Nucleosome-nucleosome interactions via histone tails and linker DNA regulate nuclear rigidity.,"Cells, as well as the nuclei inside them, experience significant mechanical stress in diverse biological processes, including contraction, migration, and adhesion. The structural stability of nuclei must therefore be maintained in order to protect genome integrity. Despite extensive knowledge on nuclear architecture and components, however, the underlying physical and molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. We address this by subjecting isolated human cell nuclei to microneedle-based quantitative micromanipulation with a series of biochemical perturbations of the chromatin. We find that the mechanical rigidity of nuclei depends on the continuity of the nucleosomal fiber and interactions between nucleosomes. Disrupting these chromatin features by varying cation concentration, acetylating histone tails, or digesting linker DNA results in loss of nuclear rigidity. In contrast, the levels of key chromatin assembly factors, including cohesin, condensin II, and CTCF, and a major nuclear envelope protein, lamin, are unaffected. Together with in situ evidence using living cells and a simple mechanical model, our findings reveal a chromatin-based regulation of the nuclear mechanical response and provide insight into the significance of local and global chromatin structures, such as those associated with interdigitated or melted nucleosomal fibers.",Mol.

28427179,"Comprehensive mapping of the effects of azacitidine on DNA methylation, repressive/permissive histone marks and gene expression in primary cells from patients with MDS and MDS-related disease.","Azacitidine (Aza) is first-line treatment for patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), although its precise mechanism of action is unknown. We performed the first study to globally evaluate the epigenetic effects of Aza on MDS bone marrow progenitor cells assessing gene expression (RNA seq), DNA methylation (Illumina 450k) and the histone modifications H3K18ac and H3K9me3 (ChIP seq). Aza induced a general increase in gene expression with 924 significantly upregulated genes but this increase showed no correlation with changes in DNA methylation or H3K18ac, and only a weak association with changes in H3K9me3. Interestingly, we observed activation of transcripts containing 15 endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) confirming previous cell line studies. DNA methylation decreased moderately in 99% of all genes, with a median β-value reduction of 0.018; the most pronounced effects seen in heterochromatin. Aza-induced hypomethylation correlated significantly with change in H3K9me3. The pattern of H3K18ac and H3K9me3 displayed large differences between patients and healthy controls without any consistent pattern induced by Aza. We conclude that the marked induction of gene expression only partly could be explained by epigenetic changes, and propose that activation of ERVs may contribute to the clinical effects of Aza in MDS.",Oncotarget,2017,"['Tobiasson M', 'Abdulkadir H', 'Lennartsson A', 'Katayama S', 'Marabita F', 'De Paepe A', 'Karimi M', 'Krjutskov K', 'Einarsdottir E', 'Grövdal M', 'Jansson M', 'Ben Azenkoud A', 'Corddedu L', 'Lehmann S', 'Ekwall K', 'Kere J', 'Hellström-Lindberg E', 'Ungerstedt J']"
28426042,Antibodies to H2a and H2b histones from the sera of HIV-infected patients catalyze site-specific degradation of these histones.,"Histones and their post-translational modifications have key roles in chromatin remodeling and gene transcription. Besides intranuclear functions, histones act as damage-associated molecules when they are released into the extracellular space. Administration of histones to animals leads to systemic inflammatory and toxic responses. Autoantibodies with enzymatic activities (abzymes) are distinctive features of some autoimmune and viral diseases. Electrophoretically homogeneous IgGs containing no canonical enzymes were isolated from the sera of HIV-infected patients by chromatography on several affinity sorbents including anti-histone Sepharose. In contrast to canonical proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, proteinase K), IgGs from HIV-infected patients specifically hydrolyzed only histones but not many other tested globular proteins. Using MALDI mass spectrometry the sites of H2a and H2b histone cleavage by anti-histone IgGs were determined for the first time. One cluster of H2a hydrolysis contains two major (↕) and four moderate (↓) cleavage sites: 31-H↓R↓L↓L↓R↕K G↕N-38. One major and two moderate sites of cleavage were revealed in the second cluster: 14-A↕KSRS↓SRA↓G-22. The third cluster corresponding to the H2a C-terminal part contains only five minor (†) sites of cleavage: 82-H†LQLAIRNDEELN†KLLG†RV†T†I-102. It was shown that two major and four moderate sites of cleavage were present in the main cluster of H2b hydrolysis: 46-K↕QvhpD↓TgiS↓SkA↓M↕GiM↓N-63. Two moderate sites of cleavage correspond to a relatively short 6-mer cluster: 12-K↓GskK↓A-17. The third relatively long 9-mer cluster contains one major and two minor sites of H2b cleavage: 80-L↕AHYN†KRS†T-88. In the nucleosome core particle, most of the major and moderate cleavage sites are located at the H2a/H2b interaction interface. Minor cleavage sites of H2a are involved in binding with H3 in the nucleosome core. Two moderate cleavage sites of H2b and one major cleavage site of H2a are located in the disordered N-terminal region interacting with DNA. According to the crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle, all identified cleavage sites are expected to affect H2a and H2b folding, nucleosome assembly, and binding of H2a and H2b with DNA. The existence of H2a and H2b hydrolyzing abzymes may be very important for the further understanding of unknown possibilities of immune systems and biological functions of antibodies.",Mol Biosyst,2017,"['Baranova SV', 'Dmitrienok PS', 'Ivanisenko NV', 'Buneva VN', 'Nevinsky GA']"
28424421,The soy-derived peptide Lunasin inhibits invasive potential of melanoma initiating cells.,"Lunasin is a 44 amino acid peptide with multiple functional domains including an aspartic acid tail, an RGD domain, and a chromatin-binding helical domain. We recently showed that Lunasin induced a phenotype switch of cancer initiating cells (CIC) out of the stem compartment by inducing melanocyte-associated differentiation markers while simultaneously reducing stem-cell-associated transcription factors. In the present study, we advance the hypothesis that Lunasin can reduce pools of melanoma cells with stem cell-like properties, and demonstrate that Lunasin treatment effectively inhibits the invasive potential of CICs in vitro as well as in vivo in a mouse experimental metastasis model. Mice receiving Lunasin treatment had significantly reduced pulmonary colonization after injection of highly metastatic B16-F10 melanoma cells compared to mice in the control group. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that Lunasin reduced activating phosphorylations of the intracellular kinases FAK and AKT as well as reduced histone acetylation of lysine residues in H3 and H4 histones. Using peptides with mutated activity domains, we functionally demonstrated that the RGD domain is necessary for Lunasin uptake and its ability to inhibit oncosphere formation by CICs, thus confirming that Lunasin's ability to affect CICs is at least in part due to the suppression of integrin signaling. Our studies suggest that Lunasin represents a unique anticancer agent that could be developed to help prevent metastasis and patient relapse by reducing the activity of CICs which are known to be resistant to current chemotherapies.",Oncotarget,2017,"['Shidal C', 'Inaba JI', 'Yaddanapudi K', 'Davis KR']"
28420141,Coordinated Actions of MicroRNAs with other Epigenetic Factors Regulate Skeletal Muscle Development and Adaptation.,"Epigenetics plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression in development, in response to cellular stress or in disease states, in virtually all cell types. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding RNA molecules that mediate RNA silencing and regulate gene expression. miRNAs were discovered in 1993 and have been extensively studied ever since. They can be expressed in a tissue-specific manner and play a crucial role in tissue development and many biological processes. miRNAs are responsible for changes in the cell epigenome because of their ability to modulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. Recently, numerous studies have shown that miRNAs and other epigenetic factors can regulate each other or cooperate in regulating several biological processes. On the one hand, the expression of some miRNAs is silenced by DNA methylation, and histone modifications have been demonstrated to modulate miRNA expression in many cell types or disease states. On the other hand, miRNAs can directly target epigenetic factors, such as DNA methyltransferases or histone deacetylases, thus regulating chromatin structure. Moreover, several studies have reported coordinated actions between miRNAs and other epigenetic mechanisms to reinforce the regulation of gene expression. This paper reviews multiple interactions between miRNAs and epigenetic factors in skeletal muscle development and in response to stimuli or disease.",Int J Mol Sci,2017,"['Bianchi M', 'Renzini A', 'Adamo S', 'Moresi V']"
28416769,Nuclear organization of nucleotide excision repair is mediated by RING1B dependent H2A-ubiquitylation.,"One of the major cellular DNA repair pathways is nucleotide excision repair (NER). It is the primary pathway for repair of various DNA lesions caused by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 photoproducts. Although lesion-containing DNA associates with the nuclear matrix after UV irradiation it is still not understood how nuclear organization affects NER. Analyzing unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) indicates that NER preferentially occurs in specific nuclear areas, viz the nucleolus. Upon inducing localized damage, we observe migration of damaged DNA towards the nucleolus. Employing a LacR-based tethering system we demonstrate that H2A-ubiquitylation via the UV-RING1B complex localizes chromatin close to the nucleolus. We further show that the H2A-ubiquitin binding protein ZRF1 resides in the nucleolus, and that it anchors ubiquitylated chromatin along with XPC. Our data thus provide insight into the sub-nuclear organization of NER and reveal a novel role for histone H2A-ubiquitylation.",Oncotarget,2017,"['Chitale S', 'Richly H']"
28416760,The histone demethylase KDM3A regulates the transcriptional program of the androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells.,"The lysine demethylase 3A (KDM3A, JMJD1A or JHDM2A) controls transcriptional networks in a variety of biological processes such as spermatogenesis, metabolism, stem cell activity, and tumor progression. We matched transcriptomic and ChIP-Seq profiles to decipher a genome-wide regulatory network of epigenetic control by KDM3A in prostate cancer cells. ChIP-Seq experiments monitoring histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation marks show global histone demethylation effects of KDM3A. Combined assessment of histone demethylation events and gene expression changes presented major transcriptional activation suggesting that distinct oncogenic regulators may synergize with the epigenetic patterns by KDM3A. Pathway enrichment analysis of cells with KDM3A knockdown prioritized androgen signaling indicating that KDM3A plays a key role in regulating androgen receptor activity. Matched ChIP-Seq and knockdown experiments of KDM3A in combination with ChIP-Seq of the androgen receptor resulted in a gain of H3K9 methylation marks around androgen receptor binding sites of selected transcriptional targets in androgen signaling including positive regulation of KRT19, NKX3-1, KLK3, NDRG1, MAF, CREB3L4, MYC, INPP4B, PTK2B, MAPK1, MAP2K1, IGF1, E2F1, HSP90AA1, HIF1A, and ACSL3.

28416484,SSRP1 Cooperates with PARP and XRCC1 to Facilitate Single-Strand DNA Break Repair by Chromatin Priming.,"DNA single-strand breaks (SSB) are the most common form of DNA damage, requiring repair processes that to initiate must overcome chromatin barriers. The FACT complex comprised of the SSRP1 and SPT16 proteins is important for maintaining chromatin integrity, with SSRP1 acting as an histone H2A/H2B chaperone in chromatin disassembly during DNA transcription, replication, and repair. In this study, we show that SSRP1, but not SPT16, is critical for cell survival after ionizing radiation or methyl methanesulfonate-induced single-strand DNA damage. SSRP1 is recruited to SSB in a PARP-dependent manner and retained at DNA damage sites by N-terminal interactions with the DNA repair protein XRCC1. Mutational analyses showed how SSRP1 function is essential for chromatin decondensation and histone H2B exchange at sites of DNA strand breaks, which are both critical to prime chromatin for efficient SSB repair and cell survival. By establishing how SSRP1 facilitates SSB repair, our findings provide a mechanistic rationale to target SSRP1 as a general approach to selectively attack cancer cells.

28414324,Correlation between histone acetylation and expression of Notch1 in human lung carcinoma and its possible role in combined small-cell lung carcinoma.,"Combined small-cell lung carcinoma (cSCLC) is composed of small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) admixed with non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Evaluating the molecular differences between SCLC and NSCLC could lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of such neoplasms. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the correlation between histone acetylation and Notch1 expression in lung carcinoma. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we measured the level of acetylated histone H3 around the promoter region of Notch1 in SCLC and NSCLC cells. We then treated SCLC cells with trichostatin A (TSA) and characterized the level of histone H3 acetylation at Notch1. In addition, TSA-treated cells were injected into immune-compromised mice, for analysis of the ex vivo tumor xenograft phenotype. The level of acetylated histone H3 surrounding the Notch1 promoter was lower in lung cancer cells not expressing Notch1. Tumors originated from TSA-treated SCLC cells occasionally formed an epithelial-like glandular arrangement of cells; with Notch1 expression and decreased expression of neuroendocrine (NE) markers. Histone deacetylation around the promoter region of Notch1 inhibits Notch1 protein expression in SCLC and the restoration of Notch1 expression in SCLC leads to the concurrent appearance of epithelial-like areas within the SCLC, which could provide a possible mechanism for histogenesis of cSCLC.",Lab.

28413449,Links between DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy in the human genome.,"BACKGROUND: DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that is enriched in heterochromatin but depleted at active promoters and enhancers. However, the debate on whether or not DNA methylation is a reliable indicator of high nucleosome occupancy has not been settled. For example, the methylation levels of DNA flanking CTCF sites are higher in linker DNA than in nucleosomal DNA, while other studies have shown that the nucleosome core is the preferred site of methylation. In this study, we make progress toward understanding these conflicting phenomena by implementing a bioinformatics approach that combines MNase-seq and NOMe-seq data and by comprehensively profiling DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy throughout the human genome.
RESULTS: The results demonstrated that increasing methylated CpG density is correlated with nucleosome occupancy in the total genome and within nearly all subgenomic regions. Features with elevated methylated CpG density such as exons, SINE-Alu sequences, H3K36-trimethylated peaks, and methylated CpG islands are among the highest nucleosome occupied elements in the genome, while some of the lowest occupancies are displayed by unmethylated CpG islands and unmethylated transcription factor binding sites. Additionally, outside of CpG islands, the density of CpGs within nucleosomes was shown to be important for the nucleosomal location of DNA methylation with low CpG frequencies favoring linker methylation and high CpG frequencies favoring core particle methylation. Prominent exceptions to the correlations between methylated CpG density and nucleosome occupancy include CpG islands marked by H3K27me3 and CpG-poor heterochromatin marked by H3K9me3, and these modifications, along with DNA methylation, distinguish the major silencing mechanisms of the human epigenome.
CONCLUSIONS: Thus, the relationship between DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy is influenced by the density of methylated CpG dinucleotides and by other epigenomic components in chromatin.",Epigenetics Chromatin,2017,"['Collings CK', 'Anderson JN']"
28412251,c-Myc Antagonises the Transcriptional Activity of the Androgen Receptor in Prostate Cancer Affecting Key Gene Networks.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common non-cutaneous cancer in men. The androgen receptor (AR), a ligand-activated transcription factor, constitutes the main drug target for advanced cases of the disease. However, a variety of other transcription factors and signaling networks have been shown to be altered in patients and to influence AR activity. Amongst these, the oncogenic transcription factor c-Myc has been studied extensively in multiple malignancies and elevated protein levels of c-Myc are commonly observed in PCa. Its impact on AR activity, however, remains elusive. In this study, we assessed the impact of c-Myc overexpression on AR activity and transcriptional output in a PCa cell line model and validated the antagonistic effect of c-MYC on AR-targets in patient samples. We found that c-Myc overexpression partially reprogrammed AR chromatin occupancy and was associated with altered histone marks distribution, most notably H3K4me1 and H3K27me3. We found c-Myc and the AR co-occupy a substantial number of binding sites and these exhibited enhancer-like characteristics. Interestingly, c-Myc overexpression antagonised clinically relevant AR target genes. Therefore, as an example, we validated the antagonistic relationship between c-Myc and two AR target genes, KLK3 (alias PSA, prostate specific antigen), and Glycine N-Methyltransferase (GNMT), in patient samples. Our findings provide unbiased evidence that MYC overexpression deregulates the AR transcriptional program, which is thought to be a driving force in PCa.",EBioMedicine,2017,"['Barfeld SJ', 'Urbanucci A', 'Itkonen HM', 'Fazli L', 'Hicks JL', 'Thiede B', 'Rennie PS', 'Yegnasubramanian S', 'DeMarzo AM', 'Mills IG']"

However, recruitment of all TFs, including pioneer factors, is impeded by condensed H3K27me3-containing chromatin. Single-cell and gene-specific analyses revealed that, during the first hours of induction of differentiation of mammalian embryonic stem cells (ESCs), accumulation of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 is delayed after DNA replication, indicative of a decondensed chromatin structure in all regions of the replicating genome. This delay provides a critical ""window of opportunity"" for recruitment of lineage-specific TFs to DNA. Increasing the levels of post-replicative H3K27me3 or preventing S phase entry inhibited recruitment of new TFs to DNA and significantly blocked cell differentiation. These findings suggest that recruitment of lineage-specifying TFs occurs soon after replication and is facilitated by a decondensed chromatin structure. This insight may explain the developmental plasticity of stem cells and facilitate their exploitation for therapeutic purposes.",Mol.

In this study, we examine chromatin structure following differentiation of the human myeloid leukemia cell line (HL-60/S4) into granulocytes with retinoic acid (RA) or into macrophage with phorbol ester (TPA). We performed ChIP-seq of histone H3 and its modifications, analyzing changes in nucleosome occupancy, nucleosome repeat length, eu-/heterochromatin redistribution and properties of epichromatin (surface chromatin adjacent to the nuclear envelope). Nucleosome positions changed genome-wide, exhibiting a specific class of alterations involving nucleosome loss in extended (∼1kb) regions, pronounced in enhancers and promoters. Genes that lost nucleosomes at their promoters showed a tendency to be upregulated. On the other hand, nucleosome gain did not show simple effects on transcript levels. The average genome-wide nucleosome repeat length (NRL) did not change significantly with differentiation. However, we detected an approximate 10 bp NRL decrease around the haematopoietic transcription factor (TF) PU.1 and the architectural protein CTCF, suggesting an effect on NRL proximal to TF binding sites. Nucleosome occupancy changed in regions associated with active promoters in differentiated cells, compared with untreated HL-60/S4 cells. Epichromatin regions revealed an increased GC content and high nucleosome density compared with surrounding chromatin. Epichromatin showed depletion of major histone modifications and revealed enrichment with PML body-associated genes.

DSBs elicit a cascade of events controlled by the ubiquitin ligase RNF168, which promotes the accumulation of repair factors such as 53BP1 and BRCA1 on the chromatin flanking the break site. RNF168 also promotes its own accumulation, and that of its paralog RNF169, but how they recognize ubiquitylated chromatin is unknown. Using methyl-TROSY solution NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations, we present an atomic resolution model of human RNF169 binding to a ubiquitylated nucleosome, and validate it by electron cryomicroscopy.

28404599,Molecular Pathways: Metabolic Control of Histone Methylation and Gene Expression in Cancer.,"Epigenetic alterations contribute to tumor development, progression, and therapeutic response. Many epigenetic enzymes use metabolic intermediates as cofactors to modify chromatin structure. Emerging evidence suggests that fluctuation in metabolite levels may regulate activities of these chromatin-modifying enzymes. Here, we summarize recent progress in understanding the cross-talk between metabolism and epigenetic control of gene expression in cancer. We focus on how metabolic changes, due to diet, genetic mutations, or tumor microenvironment, regulate histone methylation status and, consequently, affect gene expression profiles to promote tumorigenesis. Importantly, we also suggest some potential therapeutic approaches to target the oncogenic role of metabolic alterations and epigenetic modifications in cancer. ",Clin.

28403887,Global analysis of H3K27me3 as an epigenetic marker in prostate cancer progression.,"BACKGROUND: H3K27me3 histone marks shape the inhibition of gene transcription. In prostate cancer, the deregulation of H3K27me3 marks might play a role in prostate tumor progression.
METHODS: We investigated genome-wide H3K27me3 histone methylation profile using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and 2X400K promoter microarrays to identify differentially-enriched regions in biopsy samples from prostate cancer patients. H3K27me3 marks were assessed in 34 prostate tumors: 11 with Gleason score > 7 (GS > 7), 10 with Gleason score ≤ 7 (GS ≤ 7), and 13 morphologically normal prostate samples.
RESULTS: Here, H3K27me3 profiling identified an average of 386 enriched-genes on promoter regions in healthy control group versus 545 genes in GS ≤ 7 and 748 genes in GS > 7 group. We then ran a factorial discriminant analysis (FDA) and compared the enriched genes in prostate-tumor biopsies and normal biopsies using ANOVA to identify significantly differentially-enriched genes. The analysis identified ALG5, EXOSC8, CBX1, GRID2, GRIN3B, ING3, MYO1D, NPHP3-AS1, MSH6, FBXO11, SND1, SPATS2, TENM4 and TRA2A genes. These genes are possibly associated with prostate cancer. Notably, the H3K27me3 histone mark emerged as a novel regulatory mechanism in poor-prognosis prostate cancer.

28402957,Chromatin state dynamics during NK cell activation.,"Studies of Natural Killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity have mainly focused on the balance of activating and inhibitory receptors, signaling transduction, calcium influx, formation of immune synapse, and cytolytic degranulation. However, little is known about the chromatin state of NK cells and the impact of its changes during target recognition. In this study, we investigate the contribution of chromatin state dynamics during NK cell activation by comprehensively analyzing a set of microarray data and two sets of Chromatin Immunoprecipitation-Sequencing (ChIP-seq) data. We find that the expression of several histone demethylases and methyltransferases was influenced upon stimulation. Furthermore, we notice that a series of genes, including PI3KCA, NFATC1and TNFSF9, which play important roles during NK cell activation, were at 'poised' state prior to activation, and that modifications of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 on these promotors were sensitive to stimulation with Phorbol Myristate Acetate (PMA) and Ionomycin (Iono) in the NK92MI cell line. Finally, we demonstrate that a series of small molecule inhibitors, which are specific to H3K4 and H3K27 modification, enhance degranulation or the expression levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α. Our results suggest that the histone modification state has a profound impact on NK cell activation, and provide novel insights into the regulation of NK cellular cytotoxicity and immunoregulatory function by chromatin state dynamics.",Oncotarget,2017,"['Li Y', 'Wang J', 'Yin J', 'Liu X', 'Yu M', 'Li T', 'Yan H', 'Wang X']"

However, accessibility of NGS data remains a problem, and few user-friendly resources exist for integrative analysis of NGS data from different sources and experimental techniques. Here, we present Online Resource for Integrative Omics (ORIO; https://orio.niehs.nih.gov/), a web-based resource with an intuitive user interface for rapid analysis and integration of NGS data. To use ORIO, the user specifies NGS data of interest along with a list of genomic coordinates. Genomic coordinates may be biologically relevant features from a variety of sources, such as ChIP-seq peaks for a given protein or transcription start sites from known gene models. ORIO first iteratively finds read coverage values at each genomic feature for each NGS dataset. Data are then integrated using clustering-based approaches, giving hierarchical relationships across NGS datasets and separating individual genomic features into groups. In focusing its analysis on read coverage, ORIO makes limited assumptions about the analyzed data; this allows the tool to be applied across data from a variety of experiments and techniques. Results from analysis are presented in dynamic displays alongside user-controlled statistical tests, supporting rapid statistical validation of observed results. We emphasize the versatility of ORIO through diverse examples, ranging from NGS data quality control to characterization of enhancer regions and integration of gene expression information. Easily accessible on a public web server, we anticipate wide use of ORIO in genome-wide investigations by life scientists.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2017,"['Lavender CA', 'Shapiro AJ', 'Burkholder AB', 'Bennett BD', 'Adelman K', 'Fargo DC']"
28402505,DICER and ZRF1 contribute to chromatin decondensation during nucleotide excision repair.,"Repair of damaged DNA relies on the recruitment of DNA repair factors in a well orchestrated manner. As a prerequisite, the chromatin needs to be decondensed by chromatin remodelers to allow for binding of repair factors and for DNA repair to occur. Recent studies have implicated members of the SWI/SNF and INO80 families as well as PARP1 in nucleotide excision repair (NER). In this study, we report that the endonuclease DICER is implicated in chromatin decondensation during NER. In response to UV irradiation, DICER is recruited to chromatin in a ZRF1-mediated manner. The H2A-ubiquitin binding protein ZRF1 and DICER together impact on the chromatin conformation via PARP1. Moreover, DICER-mediated chromatin decondensation is independent of its catalytic activity. Taken together, we describe a novel function of DICER at chromatin and its interaction with the ubiquitin signalling cascade during GG-NER.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2017,"['Chitale S', 'Richly H']"

We report here that chromodomain Y-like protein (CDYL), a chromodomain-containing transcription corepressor, is physically associated with chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) and the replicative helicase MCM complex. We showed that CDYL bridges CAF-1 and MCM, facilitating histone transfer and deposition during DNA replication. We demonstrated that CDYL recruits histone-modifying enzymes G9a, SETDB1, and EZH2 to replication forks, leading to the addition of H3K9me2/3 and H3K27me2/3 on newly deposited histone H3. Significantly, depletion of CDYL impedes early S phase progression and sensitizes cells to DNA damage. Our data indicate that CDYL plays an important role in the transmission/restoration of repressive histone marks, thereby preserving the epigenetic landscape for the maintenance of cell identity.",J Mol Cell Biol,2017,"['Liu Y', 'Liu S', 'Yuan S', 'Yu H', 'Zhang Y', 'Yang X', 'Xie G', 'Chen Z', 'Li W', 'Xu B', 'Sun L', 'Shang Y', 'Liang J']"
28402266,Expression signatures of HOX cluster genes in cervical cancer pathogenesis: Impact of human papillomavirus type 16 oncoprotein E7.,"The Homeobox (HOX) genes encode important transcription factors showing deregulated expression in several cancers. However, their role in cervical cancer pathogenesis, remains largely unexplored. Herein, we studied their association with Human Papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) mediated cervical cancers. Our previously published gene expression microarray data revealed a significant alteration of 12 out of 39 HOX cluster members among cervical cancer cases, in comparison to the histopathologically normal controls. Of these, we validated seven (HOXA10, HOXA13, HOXB13, HOXC8, HOXC9, HOXC11 and HOXD10) by quantitative real-time PCR. We identified decreased HOXA10 expression as opposed to the increased expression of the rest. Such decrease was independent of the integration status of HPV16 genome, but correlated negatively with E7 expression in clinical samples, that was confirmed in vitro. HOXA10 and HOXB13 revealed association with Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). While HOXA10 expression correlated positively with E-Cadherin and negatively with Vimentin expression, HOXB13 showed the reverse trend. Chromatin immunoprecipitation study in vitro revealed the ability of E7 to increase HOX gene expression by epigenetic regulation, affecting the H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 status of their promoters, resulting from a loss of PRC2-LSD1 complex activity. Thus, besides identifying the deregulated expression of HOX cluster members in HPV16 positive cervical cancer and their association with EMT, our study highlighted the mechanism of HPV16 E7-mediated epigenetic regulation of HOX genes in such cancers, potentially serving as bedrock for functional studies in the future.",Oncotarget,2017,"['Saha SS', 'Chowdhury RR', 'Mondal NR', 'Roy S', 'Sengupta S']"
28387224,Multi-scale chromatin state annotation using a hierarchical hidden Markov model.,"Chromatin-state analysis is widely applied in the studies of development and diseases. However, existing methods operate at a single length scale, and therefore cannot distinguish large domains from isolated elements of the same type. To overcome this limitation, we present a hierarchical hidden Markov model, diHMM, to systematically annotate chromatin states at multiple length scales. We apply diHMM to analyse a public ChIP-seq data set. diHMM not only accurately captures nucleosome-level information, but identifies domain-level states that vary in nucleosome-level state composition, spatial distribution and functionality. The domain-level states recapitulate known patterns such as super-enhancers, bivalent promoters and Polycomb repressed regions, and identify additional patterns whose biological functions are not yet characterized. By integrating chromatin-state information with gene expression and Hi-C data, we identify context-dependent functions of nucleosome-level states. Thus, diHMM provides a powerful tool for investigating the role of higher-order chromatin structure in gene regulation.",Nat Commun,2017,"['Marco E', 'Meuleman W', 'Huang J', 'Glass K', 'Pinello L', 'Wang J', 'Kellis M', 'Yuan GC']"
28386724,Shaping the cellular landscape with Set2/SETD2 methylation.,"Chromatin structure is a major barrier to gene transcription that must be disrupted and re-set during each round of transcription. Central to this process is the Set2/SETD2 methyltransferase that mediates co-transcriptional methylation to histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me). Studies reveal that H3K36me not only prevents inappropriate transcriptional initiation from arising within gene bodies, but that it has other conserved functions that include the repair of damaged DNA and regulation of pre-mRNA splicing. Consistent with the importance of Set2/SETD2 in chromatin biology, mutations of SETD2, or mutations at or near H3K36 in H3.3, have recently been found to underlie cancer development. This review will summarize the latest insights into the functions of Set2/SETD2 in genome regulation and cancer development.",Cell. Mol. Life Sci.,2017,"['McDaniel SL', 'Strahl BD']"
28379622,Histone Modifications Pattern Associated With a State of Mesenchymal Stem Cell Cultures Derived From Amniotic Fluid of Normal and Fetus-Affected Gestations.,"Human amniotic fluid (AF)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) sharing embryonic and adult stem cells characteristics are interesting by their multipotency and the usage for regenerative medicine. However, the usefulness of these cells for revealing the fetal diseases still needs to be assessed. Here, we have analyzed the epigenetic environment in terms of histone modifications in cultures of MSCs derived from AF of normal pregnancies and those with fetal abnormalities. The comparison of MSCs samples from AF of normal pregnancies (N) and fetus-affected (P) revealed two distinct cultures by their proliferation potential (P I and P II). Cell populations from N and P I samples had similar growth characteristics and exhibited quite similar cell surface (CD44, CD90, CD105) and stemness markers (Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, Rex1) profile that was distinct in slower growing and faster senescent P II cultures. Those differences were associated with changes in 5-Cyt DNA methylation and alterations in the expression levels of chromatin modifiers (DNMT1, HDAC1/2), activating (H4ac, H3K4me3), and repressive (H3K9me2/me3, H3K27me3) histone marks. MSCs isolated from AF with the genetic or multifactorial fetal diseases (P II samples) were enriched with repressive histone marks and H4K16ac, H3K9ac, H3K14ac modifications. This study indicates that differential epigenetic environment reflects a state of AF-MSCs dependently on their growth, phenotype, and stemness characteristics suggesting a way for better understanding of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in AF-MSCs cultures in normal and diseased gestation conditions.

28375985,"Distinct functions of histone H3, lysine 4 methyltransferases in normal and malignant hematopoiesis.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Histone H3, lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation is one chromatin modification that defines distinct regulatory states of euchromatin. Mammals express six main histone methyltransferase (HMT) enzymes that modify H3K4 by monomethylation, dimethylation or trimethylation. Recent studies examine roles of some of these HMTs and their cofactors in hematopoiesis and leukemia. We discuss these emerging studies together with prior embryonic stem data, revealing how these enzymes function.
RECENT FINDINGS: Murine models have been employed to conditionally or constitutively knockout HMTs (MLL1/KMT2A, MLL2/KMT2B, MLL3/KMT2C, MLL4/KMT2D, SETD1A/KMT2F and SETD1B/KMT2G) as well as specific domains or partners of these enzymes in normal hematopoietic populations and in the context of hematologic malignancies. These studies demonstrate that global or gene-specific changes in H3K4 modification levels can be attributed to particular enzymes in particular tissues.
SUMMARY: Loss-of-function studies indicate largely nonoverlapping roles of the six H3K4 HMTs. These roles are not all necessarily due to differences in enzymatic activity and are not always accompanied by large global changes in histone modification. Both gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations in hematologic malignancy are restricted to MLL1 and MLL3/MLL4, but emerging data indicate that SETD1A/SETD1B and MLL2 can be critical in leukemia as well.",Curr.

In this study, we identified three new human histone H3 variants (named H3.6, H3.7, and H3.8), which were previously annotated as pseudogenes. H3.6 and H3.8 conserve the H3.3-specific amino acid residues, but H3.7 shares the specific amino acid residues with H3.1. We successfully reconstituted the nucleosome containing H3.6 in vitro and determined its crystal structure. In the H3.6 nucleosome, the H3.6-specific Val62 residue hydrophobically contacts the cognate H4 molecule, but its contact area is smaller than that of the corresponding H3.3 Ile62 residue. The thermal stability assay revealed that the H3.6 nucleosome is substantially unstable, as compared to the H3.3 nucleosome. Interestingly, mutational analysis demonstrated that the H3.6 Val62 residue is fully responsible for the H3.6 nucleosome instability, probably because of the weakened hydrophobic interaction with H4. We also reconstituted the nucleosome containing H3.8, but its thermal stability was quite low. In contrast, purified H3.7 failed to form nucleosomes in vitro. The identification and characterization of these novel human histone H3 variants provide important new insights into understanding the epigenetic regulation of the human genome.",Biochemistry,2017,"['Taguchi H', 'Xie Y', 'Horikoshi N', 'Maehara K', 'Harada A', 'Nogami J', 'Sato K', 'Arimura Y', 'Osakabe A', 'Kujirai T', 'Iwasaki T', 'Semba Y', 'Tachibana T', 'Kimura H', 'Ohkawa Y', 'Kurumizaka H']"
28359301,Bromodomain protein 4 discriminates tissue-specific super-enhancers containing disease-specific susceptibility loci in prostate and breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Epigenetic information can be used to identify clinically relevant genomic variants single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of functional importance in cancer development. Super-enhancers are cell-specific DNA elements, acting to determine tissue or cell identity and driving tumor progression. Although previous approaches have been tried to explain risk associated with SNPs in regulatory DNA elements, so far epigenetic readers such as bromodomain containing protein 4 (BRD4) and super-enhancers have not been used to annotate SNPs. In prostate cancer (PC), androgen receptor (AR) binding sites to chromatin have been used to inform functional annotations of SNPs.
RESULTS: Here we establish criteria for enhancer mapping which are applicable to other diseases and traits to achieve the optimal tissue-specific enrichment of PC risk SNPs. We used stratified Q-Q plots and Fisher test to assess the differential enrichment of SNPs mapping to specific categories of enhancers. We find that BRD4 is the key discriminant of tissue-specific enhancers, showing that it is more powerful than AR binding information to capture PC specific risk loci, and can be used with similar effect in breast cancer (BC) and applied to other diseases such as schizophrenia.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to evaluate the enrichment of epigenetic readers in genome-wide associations studies for SNPs within enhancers, and provides a powerful tool for enriching and prioritizing PC and BC genetic risk loci. Our study represents a proof of principle applicable to other diseases and traits that can be used to redefine molecular mechanisms of human phenotypic variation.",BMC Genomics,2017,"['Zuber V', 'Bettella F', 'Witoelar A', 'PRACTICAL Consortium', 'CRUK GWAS', 'BCAC Consortium', 'TRICL Consortium', 'Andreassen OA', 'Mills IG', 'Urbanucci A']"

Here we describe a drug-drug synergy mediated by allosteric cross-talk in chromatin, whereby the binding of one drug alters the activity of the second. We found two unrelated drugs, RAPTA-T and auranofin, that yield a synergistic activity in killing cancer cells, which coincides with a substantially greater number of chromatin adducts formed by one of the compounds when adducts from the other agent are also present. We show that this occurs through an allosteric mechanism within the nucleosome, whereby defined histone adducts of one drug promote reaction of the other drug at a distant, specific histone site. This opens up possibilities for epigenetic targeting and suggests that allosteric modulation in nucleosomes may have biological relevance and potential for therapeutic interventions.",Nat Commun,2017,"['Adhireksan Z', 'Palermo G', 'Riedel T', 'Ma Z', 'Muhammad R', 'Rothlisberger U', 'Dyson PJ', 'Davey CA']"

Changes in both metabolism and chromatin accessibility contribute to the shaping of these innate immune responses, and we are beginning to appreciate that cross-talk between these two systems plays an important role in determining innate immune cell differentiation and function. In this review we focus on acetylation, a post-translational modification important for both regulating chromatin accessibility by modulating histone function, and for functional regulation of non-histone proteins, which has many links to both immune signaling and metabolism. We discuss the interactions between metabolism and acetylation, including the requirement for metabolic intermediates as substrates and co-factors for acetylation, and the regulation of metabolic proteins and enzymes by acetylation.

28340355,The Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 ASP RNA promotes viral latency by recruiting the Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 and promoting nucleosome assembly.,"Various epigenetic marks at the HIV-1 5'LTR suppress proviral expression and promote latency. Cellular antisense transcripts known as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) recruit the polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) to gene promoters, which catalyzes trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3), thus promoting nucleosome assembly and suppressing gene expression. We found that an HIV-1 antisense transcript expressed from the 3'LTR and encoding the antisense protein ASP promotes proviral latency. Expression of ASP RNA reduced HIV-1 replication in Jurkat cells. Moreover, ASP RNA expression promoted the establishment and maintenance of HIV-1 latency in Jurkat E4 cells. We show that this transcript interacts with and recruits PRC2 to the HIV-1 5'LTR, increasing accumulation of the suppressive epigenetic mark H3K27me3, while reducing RNA Polymerase II and thus proviral transcription. Altogether, our results suggest that the HIV-1 ASP transcript promotes epigenetic silencing of the HIV-1 5'LTR and proviral latency through the PRC2 pathway.",Virology,2017,"['Zapata JC', 'Campilongo F', 'Barclay RA', 'DeMarino C', 'Iglesias-Ussel MD', 'Kashanchi F', 'Romerio F']"

To date, the role of DNA modifications in long-term potentiation (LTP) has not been explored.
RESULTS: To investigate the occurrence of DNA methylation changes in LTP, we undertook the first detailed study to describe the methylation status of all known LTP-associated genes during LTP induction in the dentate gyrus of live rats. Using a methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP)-array, together with previously published matched RNA-seq and public histone modification data, we discover widespread changes in methylation status of LTP-genes. We further show that the expression of many LTP-genes is correlated with their methylation status. We show that these correlated genes are enriched for RNA-processing, active histone marks, and specific transcription factors. These data reveal that the synaptic activity-evoked methylation changes correlates with pre-existing activation of the chromatin landscape. Finally, we show that methylation of Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) CpG-islands correlates with isoform switching from transcripts containing exon IV to exon I.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data provide the first evidence of widespread regulation of methylation status in LTP-associated genes.",BMC Genomics,2017,"['Maag JL', 'Kaczorowski DC', 'Panja D', 'Peters TJ', 'Bramham CR', 'Wibrand K', 'Dinger ME']"
28334966,Structural and mechanistic insights into regulation of HBO1 histone acetyltransferase activity by BRPF2.,"HBO1, a member of the MYST family of histone acetyltransferases (HATs), is required for global acetylation of histone H3K14 and embryonic development. It functions as a catalytic subunit in multisubunit complexes comprising a BRPF1/2/3 or JADE1/2/3 scaffold protein, and two accessory proteins. BRPF2 has been shown to be important for the HAT activity of HBO1 toward H3K14. Here we demonstrated that BRPF2 can regulate the HAT activity of HBO1 toward free H3 and H4, and nucleosomal H3. Particularly, a short N-terminal region of BRPF2 is sufficient for binding to HBO1 and can potentiate its activity toward H3K14. The crystal structure of the HBO1 MYST domain in complex with this segment of BRPF2 together with the biochemical and cell biological data revealed the key residues responsible for the HBO1-BRPF2 interaction. Our structural and functional data together indicate that the N-terminal region of BRPF2 plays an important role in the binding of HBO1 and a minor role in the binding of nucleosomes, which provide new mechanistic insights into the regulation of the HAT activity of HBO1 by BRPF2.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2017,"['Tao Y', 'Zhong C', 'Zhu J', 'Xu S', 'Ding J']"
28334823,H3.Y discriminates between HIRA and DAXX chaperone complexes and reveals unexpected insights into human DAXX-H3.3-H4 binding and deposition requirements.,"Histone chaperones prevent promiscuous histone interactions before chromatin assembly. They guarantee faithful deposition of canonical histones and functionally specialized histone variants into chromatin in a spatial- and temporally-restricted manner. Here, we identify the binding partners of the primate-specific and H3.3-related histone variant H3.Y using several quantitative mass spectrometry approaches, and biochemical and cell biological assays. We find the HIRA, but not the DAXX/ATRX, complex to recognize H3.Y, explaining its presence in transcriptionally active euchromatic regions. Accordingly, H3.Y nucleosomes are enriched in the transcription-promoting FACT complex and depleted of repressive post-translational histone modifications. H3.Y mutational gain-of-function screens reveal an unexpected combinatorial amino acid sequence requirement for histone H3.3 interaction with DAXX but not HIRA, and for H3.3 recruitment to PML nuclear bodies. We demonstrate the importance and necessity of specific H3.3 core and C-terminal amino acids in discriminating between distinct chaperone complexes. Further, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing experiments reveal that in contrast to euchromatic HIRA-dependent deposition sites, human DAXX/ATRX-dependent regions of histone H3 variant incorporation are enriched in heterochromatic H3K9me3 and simple repeat sequences. These data demonstrate that H3.Y's unique amino acids allow a functional distinction between HIRA and DAXX binding and its consequent deposition into open chromatin.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2017,"['Zink LM', 'Delbarre E', 'Eberl HC', 'Keilhauer EC', 'Bönisch C', 'Pünzeler S', 'Bartkuhn M', 'Collas P', 'Mann M', 'Hake SB']"

We investigated the epigenetic mechanism regulating ICAM1 expression. The pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α dramatically increased ICAM1 mRNA and protein levels in human brain microvascular endothelial cells and mouse brain microvessels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that TNF-α reduced methylation of histone H3 at lysines 9 and 27 (H3K9 and H3K27), well-known residues involved in gene suppression. Inhibition of G9a and EZH2, histone methyltransferases responsible for methylation at H3K9 and H3K27, respectively as well as G9a overexpression demonstrated the involvement of G9a in TNF-α-induced ICAM1 expression and leukocyte adhesion and transmigration. A specific role for KDM4B, a histone demethylase targeting H3K9me2, in TNF-α-induced ICAM1 upregulation was validated with siRNA. Moreover, treating mice with a KDM4 inhibitor ML324 blocked TNF-α-mediated neutrophil adhesion. Similarly, TNF-α-induced VCAM1 expression was suppressed by G9a overexpression and KDM4B knockdown. Collectively, we demonstrated that modification of H3K9me2 by G9a and KDM4B regulates expression of vascular adhesion molecules, and that depletion of these proteins or KDM4B reduces inflammation-induced leukocyte extravasation. Thus, blocking ICAM1 or KDM4B could offer a novel therapeutic opportunity treating brain diseases.",Sci Rep,2017,"['Choi JY', 'Yoon SS', 'Kim SE', 'Ahn Jo S']"
28326594,Hypoacetylation of acetyl-histone H3 (H3K9ac) as marker of poor prognosis in oral cancer.,"AIMS: Epigenetics refers to changes in cell characteristics that occur independently of modifications to the DNA sequence. Oral carcinogenesis is influenced by modifications in epigenetic mechanisms, including changes in histones, which are proteins that support chromatin remodelling for the dynamic regulation of gene expression and silencing. The dysregulation of histone acetylation can lead to the uncontrolled activity of different genes, thereby triggering events associated with malignant transformation. The aim of this study was to analyse the expression of acetyl-histone H3 at lys9 (H3K9ac) in oral leucoplakia (OL) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in addition to its association with cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and clinical-pathological findings.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Samples of normal oral mucosa (NOM), OL and OSCC were submitted to immunohistochemical analysis using anti-H3K9ac, Ki67 and vimentin. Slides were submitted to quantitative analysis regarding the percentage of positive cells. OSCC presented less expression of H3K9ac in comparison to OL (P < 0.01), whereas Ki67 and vimentin levels increased from OL to OSCC (P < 0.001 and P = 0.03, respectively). OSCC patients with poor prognosis had less H3K9ac expression (P = 0.04). The Kaplan-Meier cumulative survival curves also revealed lower survival rates in patients with less H3K9ac expression (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that changes in H3K9ac occur during the process of oral carcinogenesis along with an increase in cell proliferation and EMT. The results demonstrate that H3K9ac may be a useful novel prognostic marker for OSCC.",Histopathology,2017,"['Webber LP', 'Wagner VP', 'Curra M', 'Vargas PA', 'Meurer L', 'Carrard VC', 'Squarize CH', 'Castilho RM', 'Martins MD']"
28323041,Quantitative analyses of the 3D nuclear landscape recorded with super-resolved fluorescence microscopy.,"Recent advancements of super-resolved fluorescence microscopy have revolutionized microscopic studies of cells, including the exceedingly complex structural organization of cell nuclei in space and time. In this paper we describe and discuss tools for (semi-) automated, quantitative 3D analyses of the spatial nuclear organization. These tools allow the quantitative assessment of highly resolved different chromatin compaction levels in individual cell nuclei, which reflect functionally different regions or sub-compartments of the 3D nuclear landscape, and measurements of absolute distances between sites of different chromatin compaction. In addition, these tools allow 3D mapping of specific DNA/RNA sequences and nuclear proteins relative to the 3D chromatin compaction maps and comparisons of multiple cell nuclei. The tools are available in the free and open source R packages nucim and bioimagetools. We discuss the use of masks for the segmentation of nuclei and the use of DNA stains, such as DAPI, as a proxy for local differences in chromatin compaction. We further discuss the limitations of 3D maps of the nuclear landscape as well as problems of the biological interpretation of such data.",Methods,2017,"['Schmid VJ', 'Cremer M', 'Cremer T']"
28317936,Priming of transcriptional memory responses via the chromatin accessibility landscape in T cells.,"Memory T cells exhibit transcriptional memory and ""remember"" their previous pathogenic encounter to increase transcription on re-infection. However, how this transcriptional priming response is regulated is unknown. Here we performed global FAIRE-seq profiling of chromatin accessibility in a human T cell transcriptional memory model. Primary activation induced persistent accessibility changes, and secondary activation induced secondary-specific opening of previously less accessible regions associated with enhanced expression of memory-responsive genes. Increased accessibility occurred largely in distal regulatory regions and was associated with increased histone acetylation and relative H3.3 deposition. The enhanced re-stimulation response was linked to the strength of initial PKC-induced signalling, and PKC-sensitive increases in accessibility upon initial stimulation showed higher accessibility on re-stimulation. While accessibility maintenance was associated with ETS-1, accessibility at re-stimulation-specific regions was linked to NFAT, especially in combination with ETS-1, EGR, GATA, NFκB, and NR4A. Furthermore, NFATC1 was directly regulated by ETS-1 at an enhancer region. In contrast to the factors that increased accessibility, signalling from bHLH and ZEB family members enhanced decreased accessibility upon re-stimulation. Interplay between distal regulatory elements, accessibility, and the combined action of sequence-specific transcription factors allows transcriptional memory-responsive genes to ""remember"" their initial environmental encounter.",Sci Rep,2017,"['Tu WJ', 'Hardy K', 'Sutton CR', 'McCuaig R', 'Li J', 'Dunn J', 'Tan A', 'Brezar V', 'Morris M', 'Denyer G', 'Lee SK', 'Turner SJ', 'Seddiki N', 'Smith C', 'Khanna R', 'Rao S']"
28317934,DEK is required for homologous recombination repair of DNA breaks.,"DEK is a highly conserved chromatin-bound protein whose upregulation across cancer types correlates with genotoxic therapy resistance. Loss of DEK induces genome instability and sensitizes cells to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), suggesting defects in DNA repair. While these DEK-deficiency phenotypes were thought to arise from a moderate attenuation of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair, the role of DEK in DNA repair remains incompletely understood. We present new evidence demonstrating the observed decrease in NHEJ is insufficient to impact immunoglobulin class switching in DEK knockout mice. Furthermore, DEK knockout cells were sensitive to apoptosis with NHEJ inhibition. Thus, we hypothesized DEK plays additional roles in homologous recombination (HR). Using episomal and integrated reporters, we demonstrate that HR repair of conventional DSBs is severely compromised in DEK-deficient cells. To define responsible mechanisms, we tested the role of DEK in the HR repair cascade. DEK-deficient cells were impaired for γH2AX phosphorylation and attenuated for RAD51 filament formation. Additionally, DEK formed a complex with RAD51, but not BRCA1, suggesting a potential role regarding RAD51 filament formation, stability, or function. These findings define DEK as an important and multifunctional mediator of HR, and establish a synthetic lethal relationship between DEK loss and NHEJ inhibition.",Sci Rep,2017,"['Smith EA', 'Gole B', 'Willis NA', 'Soria R', 'Starnes LM', 'Krumpelbeck EF', 'Jegga AG', 'Ali AM', 'Guo H', 'Meetei AR', 'Andreassen PR', 'Kappes F', 'Vinnedge LM', 'Daniel JA', 'Scully R', 'Wiesmüller L', 'Wells SI']"
28304152,Reprogramming of histone methylation controls the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages.,"Subset heterogeneity of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) is controlled by defined transcriptional networks and programs; however, the dynamic establishment of programs that control broad, orchestrated expression of transcription factors (TFs) during the progression of monocyte-into-phagocyte (MP) differentiation remains largely unexplored. By using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we show the extensive trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) as well as histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) occupancy with broad footprints at the promoters of MP differentiation-related TFs, such as HOXA and FOXO genes, KLF4, IRF8 and others. The rapid repression of HOXA genes was closely associated with the MP differentiation program. H3K4me3 participates in regulating HOXA genes at mild and terminal differentiation periods, while H3K27me3 maintains low-level expression of HOXA genes at phagocytic maintenance periods. Furthermore, the reprogramming of H3K27me3 plays a major role in the up-regulation of KLF4 and FOXO genes during MP differentiation. Importantly, the pharmacological inhibition of H3K4me3 and/or H3K27me3 strikingly promotes the differentiation programs of THP-1 and K562 cells. Together, these findings elucidate mechanisms crucial to the dynamic establishment of epigenetic memory, which is central to the maintenance of the MP differentiation blockade.",FEBS J.,2017,"['Zheng QF', 'Wang HM', 'Wang ZF', 'Liu JY', 'Zhang Q', 'Zhang L', 'Lu YH', 'You H', 'Jin GH']"

By connecting large-scale epigenomic profiles to expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in a wide range of human tissues/cell types, we identify critical chromatin features that predict variant regulatory potential. We present cepip, a joint likelihood framework, for estimating a variant's regulatory probability in a context-dependent manner.

Many of these PTMs are selectively recognized by dedicated effector proteins for normal cell growth and development, while dysregulation of these recognition events is often implicated in human diseases, notably cancer. Thus, it is fundamentally important to elucidate the regulatory mechanism(s) underlying the readout of PTMs on histones. The Yaf9, ENL, AF9, Taf14, Sas5 (YEATS) domain is an emerging reader module that selectively recognizes histone lysine acylation with a preference for crotonylation over acetylation.

28300060,H3 ubiquitination by NEDD4 regulates H3 acetylation and tumorigenesis.,"Dynamic changes in histone modifications under various physiological cues play important roles in gene transcription and cancer. Identification of new histone marks critical for cancer development is of particular importance. Here we show that, in a glucose-dependent manner, E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 ubiquitinates histone H3 on lysine 23/36/37 residues, which specifically recruits histone acetyltransferase GCN5 for subsequent H3 acetylation. Genome-wide analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing reveals that NEDD4 regulates glucose-induced H3 K9 acetylation at transcription starting site and enhancer regions. Integrative analysis of ChIP-seq and microarray data sets also reveals a consistent role of NEDD4 in transcription activation and H3 K9 acetylation in response to glucose. Functionally, we show that NEDD4-mediated H3 ubiquitination, by transcriptionally activating IL1α, IL1β and GCLM, is important for tumour sphere formation. Together, our study reveals the mechanism for glucose-induced transcriptome reprograming and epigenetic regulation in cancer by inducing NEDD4-dependent H3 ubiquitination.",Nat Commun,2017,"['Zhang X', 'Li B', 'Rezaeian AH', 'Xu X', 'Chou PC', 'Jin G', 'Han F', 'Pan BS', 'Wang CY', 'Long J', 'Zhang A', 'Huang CY', 'Tsai FJ', 'Tsai CH', 'Logothetis C', 'Lin HK']"

We report here that MKL1 was both sufficient and necessary for p65-dependent pro-inflammatory transcriptional program in immortalized macrophages, in primary human and mouse macrophages, and in an animal model of systemic inflammation (endotoxic shock). Extensive chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) profiling and ChIP-seq analyses revealed that MKL1 deficiency erased key histone modifications synonymous with transactivation on p65 target promoters. Specifically, MKL1 defined histone H3K4 trimethylation landscape for NF-κB dependent transcription. MKL1 recruited an H3K4 trimethyltransferase SET1 to the promoter regions of p65 target genes. There, our work has identified a novel modifier of p65-dependent pro-inflammatory transcription, which may serve as potential therapeutic targets in treating inflammation related diseases.",Sci Rep,2017,"['Yu L', 'Fang F', 'Dai X', 'Xu H', 'Qi X', 'Fang M', 'Xu Y']"

Several HSP90 inhibitors have shown promising effects in clinical oncology trials. However, little is known about HSP90 inhibition-mediated bladder cancer therapy. Here, we report a quantitative proteomic study that evaluates alterations in protein expression and histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) in bladder carcinoma in response to HSP90 inhibition. We show that 5 HSP90 inhibitors (AUY922, ganetespib, SNX2112, AT13387, and CUDC305) potently inhibited the proliferation of bladder cancer 5637 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Our proteomic study quantified 518 twofold up-regulated and 811 twofold down-regulated proteins common to both AUY922 and ganetespib treatment. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that those differentially expressed proteins were involved in multiple cellular processes and enzyme-regulated signaling pathways, including chromatin modifications and cell death-associated pathways. Furthermore, quantitative proteome studies identified 14 types of PTMs with 93 marks on the core histones, including 34 novel histone marks of butyrylation, citrullination, 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation, methylation, O-GlcNAcylation, propionylation, and succinylation in AUY922- and ganetespib-treated 5637 cells.

28298436,The chromatin remodeler Chd4 maintains embryonic stem cell identity by controlling pluripotency- and differentiation-associated genes.,"The unique properties of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), including unlimited self-renewal and pluripotent differentiation potential, are sustained by integrated genetic and epigenetic networks composed of transcriptional factors and epigenetic modulators. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of these regulators are not fully elucidated. Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (Chd4), an ATPase subunit of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, is highly expressed in ESCs. However, its function in ESC regulation remains elusive. Here we report that Chd4 is required for the maintenance of ESC self-renewal. RNAi-mediated silencing of Chd4 disrupted self-renewal and up-regulated lineage commitment-associated genes under self-renewal culture conditions. During ESC differentiation in embryoid body formation, we observed significantly stronger induction of differentiation-associated genes in Chd4-deficient cells. The phenotype was different from that caused by the deletion of Mbd3, another subunit of the NuRD complex. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that Chd4 secured ESC identity by controlling the expression of subsets of pluripotency- and differentiation-associated genes. Importantly, Chd4 repressed the transcription of T box protein 3 (Tbx3), a transcription factor with important functions in ESC fate determination. Tbx3 knockdown partially rescued aberrant activation of differentiation-associated genes, especially of endoderm-associated genes, induced by Chd4 depletion. Moreover, we identified an interaction of Chd4 with the histone variant H2A.Z. This variant stabilized Chd4 by inhibiting Chd4 protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Collectively, this study identifies the Chd4-Tbx3 axis in controlling ESC fate and a role of H2A.Z in maintaining the stability of Chd4 proteins.",J. Biol.

28293301,Histone peptide microarray screen of chromo and Tudor domains defines new histone lysine methylation interactions.,"BACKGROUND: Histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) function to regulate chromatin structure and function in part through the recruitment of effector proteins that harbor specialized ""reader"" domains. Despite efforts to elucidate reader domain-PTM interactions, the influence of neighboring PTMs and the target specificity of many reader domains is still unclear. The aim of this study was to use a high-throughput histone peptide microarray platform to interrogate 83 known and putative histone reader domains from the chromo and Tudor domain families to identify their interactions and characterize the influence of neighboring PTMs on these interactions.
RESULTS: Nearly a quarter of the chromo and Tudor domains screened showed interactions with histone PTMs by peptide microarray, revealing known and several novel methyllysine interactions. Specifically, we found that the CBX/HP1 chromodomains that recognize H3K9me also recognize H3K23me2/3-a poorly understood histone PTM. We also observed that, in addition to their interaction with H3K4me3, Tudor domains of the Spindlin family also recognized H4K20me3-a previously uncharacterized interaction. Several Tudor domains also showed novel interactions with H3K4me as well.
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide an important resource for the epigenetics and chromatin community on the interactions of many human chromo and Tudor domains.

28289232,Transcriptional landscape of the human cell cycle.,"Steady-state gene expression across the cell cycle has been studied extensively. However, transcriptional gene regulation and the dynamics of histone modification at different cell-cycle stages are largely unknown. By applying a combination of global nuclear run-on sequencing (GRO-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and histone-modification Chip sequencing (ChIP-seq), we depicted a comprehensive transcriptional landscape at the G0/G1, G1/S, and M phases of breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Importantly, GRO-seq and RNA-seq analysis identified different cell-cycle-regulated genes, suggesting a lag between transcription and steady-state expression during the cell cycle. Interestingly, we identified genes actively transcribed at early M phase that are longer in length and have low expression and are accompanied by a global increase in active histone 3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me2) and histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) modifications. In addition, we identified 2,440 cell-cycle-regulated enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) that are strongly associated with differential active transcription but not with stable expression levels across the cell cycle. Motif analysis of dynamic eRNAs predicted Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) as a key regulator of G1/S transition, and this identification was validated experimentally.

28284043,The histone variant H3.3 claims its place in the crowded scene of epigenetics.,"Histones are evolutionarily conserved DNA-binding proteins. As scaffolding molecules, they significantly regulate the DNA packaging into the nucleus of all eukaryotic cells. As docking units, they influence the recruitment of the transcriptional machinery, thus establishing unique gene expression patterns that ultimately promote different biological outcomes. While canonical histones H3.1 and H3.2 are synthetized and loaded during DNA replication, the histone variant H3.3 is expressed and deposited into the chromatin throughout the cell cycle. Recent findings indicate that H3.3 replaces the majority of canonical H3 in non-dividing cells, reaching almost saturation levels in a time-dependent manner. Consequently, H3.3 incorporation and turnover represent an additional layer in the regulation of the chromatin landscape during aging. In this respect, work from our group and others suggest that H3.3 plays an important function in age-related processes throughout evolution. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on H3.3 biology and discuss the implications of its aberrant dynamics in the establishment of cellular states that may lead to human pathology. Critically, we review the importance of H3.3 turnover as part of epigenetic events that influence senescence and age-related processes.

Discovery of the mechanisms involved in this association should provide valuable background for therapeutic treatments. Early embryogenesis involves epigenetic changes including histone modifications. The bivalent histone methylation marks H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 are important for regulating key developmental genes during early fetal pancreas specification. We hypothesized that maternal hyperglycemia disrupted early pancreas development through changes in histone bivalency. A human embryonic stem cell line (VAL3) was used as the cell model for studying the effects of hyperglycemia upon differentiation into definitive endoderm (DE), an early stage of the pancreatic lineage. Hyperglycemic conditions significantly down-regulated the expression levels of DE markers SOX17, FOXA2, CXCR4 and EOMES during differentiation. This was associated with retention of the repressive histone methylation mark H3K27me3 on their promoters under hyperglycemic conditions. The disruption of histone methylation patterns was observed as early as the mesendoderm stage, with Wnt/β-catenin signaling being suppressed during hyperglycemia. Treatment with Wnt/β-catenin signaling activator CHIR-99021 restored the expression levels and chromatin methylation status of DE markers, even in a hyperglycemic environment. The disruption of DE development was also found in mouse embryos at day 7.5 post coitum from diabetic mothers. Furthermore, disruption of DE differentiation in VAL3 cells led to subsequent impairment in pancreatic progenitor formation. Thus, early exposure to hyperglycemic conditions hinders DE development with a possible relationship to the later impairment of pancreas specification.",Cell Tissue Res.,2017,"['Chen ACH', 'Lee YL', 'Fong SW', 'Wong CCY', 'Ng EHY', 'Yeung WSB']"

Here, we present results demonstrating that macroH2A variants have a major function in maintaining nuclear organization and heterochromatin architecture. Specifically, we find that a substantial amount of macroH2A is associated with heterochromatic repeat sequences. We further identify macroH2A on sites of interstitial heterochromatin decorated by histone H3 trimethylated on K9 (H3K9me3). Loss of macroH2A leads to major defects in nuclear organization, including reduced nuclear circularity, disruption of nucleoli and a global loss of dense heterochromatin. Domains formed by DNA repeat sequences are disorganized, expanded and fragmented, and mildly re-expressed when depleted of macroH2A. At the molecular level, we find that macroH2A is required for the interaction of repeat sequences with the nucleostructural protein lamin B1. Taken together, our results argue that a major function of macroH2A histone variants is to link nucleosome composition to higher-order chromatin architecture.",J. Cell.

28278055,Comparative analyses identify molecular signature of MRI-classified SVZ-associated glioblastoma.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain cancer with limited therapeutic options. While efforts to identify genes responsible for GBM have revealed mutations and aberrant gene expression associated with distinct types of GBM, patients with GBM are often diagnosed and classified based on MRI features. Therefore, we seek to identify molecular representatives in parallel with MRI classification for group I and group II primary GBM associated with the subventricular zone (SVZ). As group I and II GBM contain stem-like signature, we compared gene expression profiles between these 2 groups of primary GBM and endogenous neural stem progenitor cells to reveal dysregulation of cell cycle, chromatin status, cellular morphogenesis, and signaling pathways in these 2 types of MRI-classified GBM. In the absence of IDH mutation, several genes associated with metabolism are differentially expressed in these subtypes of primary GBM, implicating metabolic reprogramming occurs in tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, histone lysine methyltransferase EZH2 was upregulated while histone lysine demethylases KDM2 and KDM4 were downregulated in both group I and II primary GBM. Lastly, we identified 9 common genes across large data sets of gene expression profiles among MRI-classified group I/II GBM, a large cohort of GBM subtypes from TCGA, and glioma stem cells by unsupervised clustering comparison. These commonly upregulated genes have known functions in cell cycle, centromere assembly, chromosome segregation, and mitotic progression.

28266526,ELF-MF exposure affects the robustness of epigenetic programming during granulopoiesis.,"Extremely-low-frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF) have been classified as ""possibly carcinogenic"" to humans on the grounds of an epidemiological association of ELF-MF exposure with an increased risk of childhood leukaemia. Yet, underlying mechanisms have remained obscure. Genome instability seems an unlikely reason as the energy transmitted by ELF-MF is too low to damage DNA and induce cancer-promoting mutations. ELF-MF, however, may perturb the epigenetic code of genomes, which is well-known to be sensitive to environmental conditions and generally deranged in cancers, including leukaemia. We examined the potential of ELF-MF to influence key epigenetic modifications in leukaemic Jurkat cells and in human CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells undergoing in vitro differentiation into the neutrophilic lineage. During granulopoiesis, sensitive genome-wide profiling of multiple replicate experiments did not reveal any statistically significant, ELF-MF-dependent alterations in the patterns of active (H3K4me2) and repressive (H3K27me3) histone marks nor in DNA methylation. However, ELF-MF exposure showed consistent effects on the reproducibility of these histone and DNA modification profiles (replicate variability), which appear to be of a stochastic nature but show preferences for the genomic context.

28265301,Assessing histone demethylase inhibitors in cells: lessons learned.,"BACKGROUND: Histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) are of interest as drug targets due to their regulatory roles in chromatin organization and their tight associations with diseases including cancer and mental disorders. The first KDM inhibitors for KDM1 have entered clinical trials, and efforts are ongoing to develop potent, selective and cell-active 'probe' molecules for this target class. Robust cellular assays to assess the specific engagement of KDM inhibitors in cells as well as their cellular selectivity are a prerequisite for the development of high-quality inhibitors. Here we describe the use of a high-content cellular immunofluorescence assay as a method for demonstrating target engagement in cells.
RESULTS: A panel of assays for the Jumonji C subfamily of KDMs was developed to encompass all major branches of the JmjC phylogenetic tree. These assays compare compound activity against wild-type KDM proteins to a catalytically inactive version of the KDM, in which residues involved in the active-site iron coordination are mutated to inactivate the enzyme activity. These mutants are critical for assessing the specific effect of KDM inhibitors and for revealing indirect effects on histone methylation status. The reported assays make use of ectopically expressed demethylases, and we demonstrate their use to profile several recently identified classes of KDM inhibitors and their structurally matched inactive controls. The generated data correlate well with assay results assessing endogenous KDM inhibition and confirm the selectivity observed in biochemical assays with isolated enzymes. We find that both cellular permeability and competition with 2-oxoglutarate affect the translation of biochemical activity to cellular inhibition.
CONCLUSIONS: High-content-based immunofluorescence assays have been established for eight KDM members of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases covering all major branches of the JmjC-KDM phylogenetic tree. The usage of both full-length, wild-type and catalytically inactive mutant ectopically expressed protein, as well as structure-matched inactive control compounds, allowed for detection of nonspecific effects causing changes in histone methylation as a result of compound toxicity. The developed assays offer a histone lysine demethylase family-wide tool for assessing KDM inhibitors for cell activity and on-target efficacy.

Utilizing mouse embryonic fibroblast and cancer cell line models, here we show via ChIP-seq and biochemical assays that SWI/SNF complexes are preferentially targeted to distal lineage specific enhancers and interact with p300 to modulate histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation. We identify a greater requirement for SWI/SNF at typical enhancers than at most super-enhancers and at enhancers in untranscribed regions than in transcribed regions. Our data further demonstrate that SWI/SNF-dependent distal enhancers are essential for controlling expression of genes linked to developmental processes. Our findings thus establish SWI/SNF complexes as regulators of the enhancer landscape and provide insight into the roles of SWI/SNF in cellular fate control.",Nat Commun,2017,"['Alver BH', 'Kim KH', 'Lu P', 'Wang X', 'Manchester HE', 'Wang W', 'Haswell JR', 'Park PJ', 'Roberts CW']"

28257484,The vaccinia virus K7 protein promotes histone methylation associated with heterochromatin formation.,"It has been well established that many vaccinia virus proteins suppress host antiviral pathways by targeting the transcription of antiviral proteins, thus evading the host innate immune system. However, whether viral proteins have an effect on the host's overall cellular transcription is less understood. In this study we investigated the regulation of heterochromatin during vaccinia virus infection. Heterochromatin is a highly condensed form of chromatin that is less transcriptionally active and characterized by methylation of histone proteins. We examined the change in methylation of two histone proteins, H3 and H4, which are major markers of heterochromatin, during the course of viral infection. Using immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry we were able to track the overall change in the methylated levels of H3K9 and H4K20. Our results suggest that there is significant increase in methylation of H3K9 and H4K20 during Orthopoxviruses infection compared to mock-infected cells. However, this effect was not seen when we infected cells with Leporipoxviruses. We further screened several vaccinia virus single and multi-gene deletion mutant and identified the vaccinia virus gene K7R as a contributor to the increase in cellular histone methylation during infection.",PLoS ONE,2017,"['Teferi WM', 'Desaulniers MA', 'Noyce RS', 'Shenouda M', 'Umer B', 'Evans DH']"

Epigenetic signatures, early life experience and environmental factors, converge to influence gene expression patterns in addiction phenotypes and consequently may serve as mediators of behavioural trait transmission between generations. The majority of studies investigating the role of epigenetics in addiction do not consider the influence of social interactions. This shortcoming in current experimental approaches necessitates developing social models that reflect the addictive behaviour in a free-living social environment. Furthermore, this review also reports on the advancement of interventions for drug addiction and takes into account the emerging roles of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors in the etiology of drug addiction and that HDAC may be a potential therapeutic target at nucleosomal level to improve treatment outcomes.",Cell.

28251751,Histone H1 chaperone activity of TAF-I is regulated by its subtype-dependent intramolecular interaction.,"Linker histone H1 is involved in the regulation of gene activity through the maintenance of higher-order chromatin structure. Previously, we have shown that template activating factor-I (TAF-I or protein SET) is involved in linker histone H1 dynamics as a histone H1 chaperone. In human and murine cells, two TAF-I subtypes exist, namely TAF-Iα and TAF-Iβ. TAF-I has a highly acidic amino acid cluster in its C-terminal region and forms homo- or heterodimers through its dimerization domain. Both dimer formation and the C-terminal region of TAF-I are essential for the histone chaperone activity. TAF-Iα exhibits less histone chaperone activity compared with TAF-Iβ even though TAF-Iα and β differ only in their N-terminal regions. However, it is unclear how subtype-specific TAF-I activities are regulated. Here, we have shown that the N-terminal region of TAF-Iα autoinhibits its histone chaperone activity via intramolecular interaction with its C-terminal region. When the interaction between the N- and C-terminal regions of TAF-Iα is disrupted, TAF-Iα shows a histone chaperone activity similar to that of TAF-Iβ. Taken together, these results provide mechanistic insights into the concept that fine tuning of TAF-I histone H1 chaperone activity relies on the subtype compositions of the TAF-I dimer.",Genes Cells,2017,"['Kajitani K', 'Kato K', 'Nagata K']"
28249877,Cardiac Fibroblast-Specific Activating Transcription Factor 3 Protects Against Heart Failure by Suppressing MAP2K3-p38 Signaling.,"BACKGROUND: Hypertensive ventricular remodeling is a common cause of heart failure. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating ventricular remodeling remain poorly understood.
METHODS: We used a discovery-driven/nonbiased approach to identify increased activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) expression in hypertensive heart. We used loss/gain of function approaches to understand the role of ATF3 in heart failure. We also examined the mechanisms through transcriptome, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis, and in vivo and in vitro experiments.
RESULTS: ATF3 expression increased in murine hypertensive heart and human hypertrophic heart. Cardiac fibroblast cells are the primary cell type expressing high ATF3 levels in response to hypertensive stimuli. ATF3 knockout (ATF3KO) markedly exaggerated hypertensive ventricular remodeling, a state rescued by lentivirus-mediated/miRNA-aided cardiac fibroblast-selective ATF3 overexpression. Conversely, conditional cardiac fibroblast cell-specific ATF3 transgenic overexpression significantly ameliorated ventricular remodeling and heart failure. We identified Map2K3 as a novel ATF3 target. ATF3 binds with the Map2K3 promoter, recruiting HDAC1, resulting in Map2K3 gene-associated histone deacetylation, thereby inhibiting Map2K3 expression. Genetic Map2K3 knockdown rescued the profibrotic/hypertrophic phenotype in ATF3KO cells. Last, we demonstrated that p38 is the downstream molecule of Map2K3 mediating the profibrotic/hypertrophic effects in ATF3KO animals. Inhibition of p38 signaling reduced transforming growth factor-β signaling-related profibrotic and hypertrophic gene expression, and blocked exaggerated cardiac remodeling in ATF3KO cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides the first evidence that ATF3 upregulation in cardiac fibroblasts in response to hypertensive stimuli protects the heart by suppressing Map2K3 expression and subsequent p38-transforming growth factor-β signaling. These results suggest that positive modulation of cardiac fibroblast ATF3 may represent a novel therapeutic approach against hypertensive cardiac remodeling.",Circulation,2017,"['Li Y', 'Li Z', 'Zhang C', 'Li P', 'Wu Y', 'Wang C', 'Bond Lau W', 'Ma XL', 'Du J']"

Here we show that the SETD8/PR-Set7 methyltransferase, which catalyzes mono-methylation of histone H4 at lysine 20 (H4K20me1), suppresses nucleolar and mitochondrial activities to prevent cellular senescence. SETD8 protein was selectively downregulated in both oncogene-induced and replicative senescence. Inhibition of SETD8 alone was sufficient to trigger senescence.

However, the involvement of deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) targeting ubiquitylated histone H3 in the maintenance of DNA methylation is largely unknown. With the use of Xenopus egg extracts, we demonstrate here that Usp7, a ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase, forms a stable complex with Dnmt1 and is recruited to DNA methylation sites during DNA replication. Usp7 deubiquitylates ubiquitylated histone H3 in vitro. Inhibition of Usp7 activity or its depletion in egg extracts results in enhanced and extended binding of Dnmt1 to chromatin, suppressing DNA methylation. Depletion of Usp7 in HeLa cells causes enhanced histone H3 ubiquitylation and enlargement of Dnmt1 nuclear foci during DNA replication. Our results thus suggest that Usp7 is a key factor that regulates maintenance of DNA methylation.",Sci Rep,2017,"['Yamaguchi L', 'Nishiyama A', 'Misaki T', 'Johmura Y', 'Ueda J', 'Arita K', 'Nagao K', 'Obuse C', 'Nakanishi M']"

28242760,DNA breaks and chromatin structural changes enhance the transcription of autoimmune regulator target genes.,"The autoimmune regulator (AIRE) protein is the key factor in thymic negative selection of autoreactive T cells by promoting the ectopic expression of tissue-specific genes in the thymic medullary epithelium. Mutations in AIRE cause a monogenic autoimmune disease called autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy. AIRE has been shown to promote DNA breaks via its interaction with topoisomerase 2 (TOP2). In this study, we investigated topoisomerase-induced DNA breaks and chromatin structural alterations in conjunction with AIRE-dependent gene expression. Using RNA sequencing, we found that inhibition of TOP2 religation activity by etoposide in AIRE-expressing cells had a synergistic effect on genes with low expression levels. AIRE-mediated transcription was not only enhanced by TOP2 inhibition but also by the TOP1 inhibitor camptothecin. The transcriptional activation was associated with structural rearrangements in chromatin, notably the accumulation of γH2AX and the exchange of histone H1 with HMGB1 at AIRE target gene promoters. In addition, we found the transcriptional up-regulation to co-occur with the chromatin structural changes within the genomic cluster of carcinoembryonic antigen-like cellular adhesion molecule genes. Overall, our results suggest that the presence of AIRE can trigger molecular events leading to an altered chromatin landscape and the enhanced transcription of low-expressed genes.",J. Biol.

28242625,ZMYM3 regulates BRCA1 localization at damaged chromatin to promote DNA repair.,"Chromatin connects DNA damage response factors to sites of damaged DNA to promote the signaling and repair of DNA lesions. The histone H2A variants H2AX, H2AZ, and macroH2A represent key chromatin constituents that facilitate DNA repair. Through proteomic screening of these variants, we identified ZMYM3 (zinc finger, myeloproliferative, and mental retardation-type 3) as a chromatin-interacting protein that promotes DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR). ZMYM3 is recruited to DNA double-strand breaks through bivalent interactions with both histone and DNA components of the nucleosome. We show that ZMYM3 links the HR factor BRCA1 to damaged chromatin through specific interactions with components of the BRCA1-A subcomplex, including ABRA1 and RAP80. By regulating ABRA1 recruitment to damaged chromatin, ZMYM3 facilitates the fine-tuning of BRCA1 interactions with DNA damage sites and chromatin. Consistent with a role in regulating BRCA1 function, ZMYM3 deficiency results in impaired HR repair and genome instability. Thus, our work identifies a critical chromatin-binding DNA damage response factor, ZMYM3, which modulates BRCA1 functions within chromatin to ensure the maintenance of genome integrity.",Genes Dev.,2017,"['Leung JW', 'Makharashvili N', 'Agarwal P', 'Chiu LY', 'Pourpre R', 'Cammarata MB', 'Cannon JR', 'Sherker A', 'Durocher D', 'Brodbelt JS', 'Paull TT', 'Miller KM']"

Although cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide, a systematic study about the prognostic value of specific changes in the chromatin structure, such as histone acetylation or histone methylation, is missing. In this study, the expression of histone H3 acetyl K9, which is known to denote active regions at enhancers and promoters, and histone H3 tri methyl K4, which preferentially identifies active gene promoters, were examined as both show high metastatic potential. A panel of patients with cervical cancer was selected and the importance of the histone modifications concerning survival-time (overall survival and relapse-free survival) was analyzed in 250 cases. Histone H3 acetyl K9 staining was correlated with low grading, low FIGO (TNM classification and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) status, negative N-status and low T-status in cervical cancer, showing a higher expression in adenocarcinoma than in squamous cell carcinoma. Cytoplasmic expression of histone H3 tri methyl K4 in a cervical cancer specimen was correlated with advanced T-status and poor prognosis. While cytoplasmic H3K4me3 expression seemed to be a marker of relapse-free survival, nuclear expression showed a correlation to poor prognosis in overall survival. Within this study, we analyzed the chemical modification of two histone proteins that are connected to active gene expression. Histone H3 acetyl K9 was found to be an independent marker of overall survival. Histone H3 tri methyl K4 was correlated with poor prognosis and it was found to be an independent marker of relapse-free survival. Therefore, we could show that chromatin remodeling plays an important role in cervical cancer biology.",Int J Mol Sci,2017,"['Beyer S', 'Zhu J', 'Mayr D', 'Kuhn C', 'Schulze S', 'Hofmann S', 'Dannecker C', 'Jeschke U', 'Kost BP']"
28241141,ENL links histone acetylation to oncogenic gene expression in acute myeloid leukaemia.,"Cancer cells are characterized by aberrant epigenetic landscapes and often exploit chromatin machinery to activate oncogenic gene expression programs. Recognition of modified histones by 'reader' proteins constitutes a key mechanism underlying these processes; therefore, targeting such pathways holds clinical promise, as exemplified by the development of bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitors. We recently identified the YEATS domain as an acetyl-lysine-binding module, but its functional importance in human cancer remains unknown. Here we show that the YEATS domain-containing protein ENL, but not its paralogue AF9, is required for disease maintenance in acute myeloid leukaemia. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated depletion of ENL led to anti-leukaemic effects, including increased terminal myeloid differentiation and suppression of leukaemia growth in vitro and in vivo. Biochemical and crystal structural studies and chromatin-immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing analyses revealed that ENL binds to acetylated histone H3, and co-localizes with H3K27ac and H3K9ac on the promoters of actively transcribed genes that are essential for leukaemia. Disrupting the interaction between the YEATS domain and histone acetylation via structure-based mutagenesis reduced the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to ENL-target genes, leading to the suppression of oncogenic gene expression programs. Notably, disrupting the functionality of ENL further sensitized leukaemia cells to BET inhibitors. Together, our data identify ENL as a histone acetylation reader that regulates oncogenic transcriptional programs in acute myeloid leukaemia, and suggest that displacement of ENL from chromatin may be a promising epigenetic therapy, alone or in combination with BET inhibitors, for aggressive leukaemia.",Nature,2017,"['Wan L', 'Wen H', 'Li Y', 'Lyu J', 'Xi Y', 'Hoshii T', 'Joseph JK', 'Wang X', 'Loh YE', 'Erb MA', 'Souza AL', 'Bradner JE', 'Shen L', 'Li W', 'Li H', 'Allis CD', 'Armstrong SA', 'Shi X']"
28240985,A PALB2-interacting domain in RNF168 couples homologous recombination to DNA break-induced chromatin ubiquitylation.,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) elicit a ubiquitylation cascade that controls DNA repair pathway choice. This cascade involves the ubiquitylation of histone H2A by the RNF168 ligase and the subsequent recruitment of RIF1, which suppresses homologous recombination (HR) in G1 cells. The RIF1-dependent suppression is relieved in S/G2 cells, allowing PALB2-driven HR to occur. With the inhibitory impact of RIF1 relieved, it remains unclear how RNF168-induced ubiquitylation influences HR. Here, we uncover that RNF168 links the HR machinery to H2A ubiquitylation in S/G2 cells. We show that PALB2 indirectly recognizes histone ubiquitylation by physically associating with ubiquitin-bound RNF168. This direct interaction is mediated by the newly identified PALB2-interacting domain (PID) in RNF168 and the WD40 domain in PALB2, and drives DNA repair by facilitating the assembly of PALB2-containing HR complexes at DSBs. Our findings demonstrate that RNF168 couples PALB2-dependent HR to H2A ubiquitylation to promote DNA repair and preserve genome integrity.",Elife,2017,"['Luijsterburg MS', 'Typas D', 'Caron MC', 'Wiegant WW', 'van den Heuvel D', 'Boonen RA', 'Couturier AM', 'Mullenders LH', 'Masson JY', 'van Attikum H']"

Because further epigenetic regulatory mechanisms are unclear, we investigated the roles of DNA methylation and histone acetylation in UV-induced regulation of COL1A2 transcription in human dermal fibroblasts. Anacardic acid, a p300 histone acetyltransferase inhibitor, rescued the UV-induced decrease of type I procollagen expression in human dermal fibroblasts. Although UV irradiation induced global histone acetylation, it reduced the local recruitment of histone H3 acetylation as well as p300, and Smad2/3 to the p300 binding site (-1406/-1393), in the COL1A2 promoter as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation. This effect was reversed by anacardic acid treatment. In contrast, pyrosequencing analysis showed that UV irradiation induced DNA methylation in the same region of the COL1A2 promoter, which was reversed by anacardic acid and a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (5-AZA-2'-deoxycytidine). Inhibition of UV-induced DNA methylation led to an increase of UV-induced histone acetylation in the COL1A2 promoter and increased the recruitment of transcription factors, leading to up-regulation of type I collagen after UV irradiation. Collectively, our findings indicate that the epigenetic crosstalk between DNA methylation and histone acetylation plays a crucial role in COL1A2 transcription induced by UV irradiation.",J. Invest.

28233440,Xeroderma pigmentosum group C protein interacts with histones: regulation by acetylated states of histone H3.,"In the mammalian global genome nucleotide excision repair pathway, two damage recognition factors, XPC and UV-DDB, play pivotal roles in the initiation of the repair reaction. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of the lesion recognition process in the context of chromatin structures remain to be understood. Here, we show evidence that damage recognition factors tend to associate with chromatin regions devoid of certain types of acetylated histones. Treatment of cells with histone deacetylase inhibitors retarded recruitment of XPC to sites of UV-induced DNA damage and the subsequent repair process. Biochemical studies showed novel multifaceted interactions of XPC with histone H3, which were profoundly impaired by deletion of the N-terminal tail of histone H3. In addition, histone H1 also interacted with XPC. Importantly, acetylation of histone H3 markedly attenuated the interaction with XPC in vitro, and local UV irradiation of cells decreased the level of H3K27ac in the damaged areas. Our results suggest that histone deacetylation plays a significant role in the process of DNA damage recognition for nucleotide excision repair and that the localization and functions of XPC can be regulated by acetylated states of histones.",Genes Cells,2017,"['Kakumu E', 'Nakanishi S', 'Shiratori HM', 'Kato A', 'Kobayashi W', 'Machida S', 'Yasuda T', 'Adachi N', 'Saito N', 'Ikura T', 'Kurumizaka H', 'Kimura H', 'Yokoi M', 'Sakai W', 'Sugasawa K']"
28232094,Chromatin reader ZMYND8 is a key target of all trans retinoic acid-mediated inhibition of cancer cell proliferation.,"All trans retinoic acid (ATRA), an active vitamin-A derivative, has been shown to regulate gene expression program and thus imparts anti-proliferative activity to cancer cells. Previously, we identified a dual histone reader ZMYND8 (zinc finger MYND (Myeloid, Nervy and DEAF-1)-type containing 8), to be a novel target of ATRA. In the present study, we attempted to decipher the detail mechanism of its transcription regulation. ATRA can reprogram the epigenetic landscape in the upstream regulatory region of ZMYND8 thereby promoting its expression. Interestingly, there is a unique H3K27Me3 to H3K27Ac switch upon ATRA-treatment. We show here that ATRA causes dynamic changes in recruitment of transcription factor YY1 in concert with HDAC1 at ZMYND8 promoter. Further, we show that ATRA treatment triggers an anti-proliferative activity in cancer cells through regulation of ZMYND8 expression. Subsequently, in 4T1-induced syngenic tumor mouse model, ATRA injection caused significant upregulation of ZMYND8. Overall our findings highlight a novel mechanism underlying ATRA-mediated changes in ZMYND8 expression which, in turn, activates the anti-proliferative program in a cancer cell.

28228401,Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome candidate 1-like 1 epigenetically regulates nephrin gene expression.,"Altered expression of nephrin underlies the pathophysiology of proteinuria in both congenital and acquired nephrotic syndrome. However, the epigenetic mechanisms of nephrin gene regulation remain elusive. Here, we show that Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome candidate 1-like 1 long form (WHSC1L1-L) is a novel epigenetic modifier of nephrin gene regulation. WHSC1L1-L was associated with histone H3K4 and H3K36 in human embryonic kidney cells. WHSC1L1-L gene was expressed in the podocytes, and functional protein product was detected in these cells. WHSC1L1-L was found to bind nephrin but not other podocyte-specific gene promoters, leading to its inhibition/suppression, abrogating the stimulatory effect of WT1 and NF-κB. Gene knockdown of WHSC1L1-L in primary cultured podocytes accelerated the transcription of nephrin but not CD2AP. An in vivo zebrafish study involving the injection of Whsc1l1 mRNA into embryos demonstrated an apparent reduction of nephrin mRNA but not podocin and CD2AP mRNA. Immunohistochemistry showed that both WHSC1L1-L and nephrin emerged at the S-shaped body stage in glomeruli. Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy displayed WHSC1L1 to colocalize with trimethylated H3K4 in the glomerular podocytes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed the reduction of the association of trimethylated H3K4 at the nephrin promoter regions. Finally, nephrin mRNA was upregulated in the glomerulus at the early proteinuric stage of mouse nephrosis, which was associated with the reduction of WHSC1L1. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that WHSC1L1-L acts as a histone methyltransferase in podocytes and regulates nephrin gene expression, which may in turn contribute to the integrity of the slit diaphragm of the glomerular filtration barrier.",Am.

An unexpected attribute of these nuclear proteins is their antimicrobial activity.

Investigating the susceptibility of various Gram-positive pathogens to histones, we found high-level resistance by one leading human pathogen, group A Streptococcus (GAS). A screen of isogenic mutants revealed that the highly surface-expressed M1 protein, a classical GAS virulence factor, was required for high-level histone resistance. Biochemical and microscopic analyses revealed that the N-terminal domain of M1 protein binds and inactivates histones before they reach their cell wall target of action. This finding illustrates a new pathogenic function for this classic GAS virulence factor, and highlights a potential innate immune evasion strategy that may be employed by other bacterial pathogens.",Sci Rep,2017,"['Döhrmann S', 'LaRock CN', 'Anderson EL', 'Cole JN', 'Ryali B', 'Stewart C', 'Nonejuie P', 'Pogliano J', 'Corriden R', 'Ghosh P', 'Nizet V']"

Centromere identity is determined epigenetically by the presence of a centromere-specific histone H3 variant, CENP-A, that replaces canonical H3 in centromeric chromatin. Here, we discuss recent work by Roulland et al. that identifies structural elements of the nucleosome as essential determinants of centromere function. In particular, CENP-A nucleosomes have flexible DNA ends due to the short αN helix of CENP-A. The higher flexibility of the DNA ends of centromeric nucleosomes impairs binding of linker histones H1, while it facilitates binding of other essential centromeric proteins, such as CENP-C, and is required for mitotic fidelity. This work extends previous observations indicating that the differential structural properties of CENP-A nucleosomes are on the basis of its contribution to centromere identity and function.

However, how telomere integrity is maintained, especially in response to damage, remains poorly understood. Here, we identify Nek7, a member of the Never in Mitosis Gene A (NIMA) kinase family, as a regulator of telomere integrity. Nek7 is recruited to telomeres and stabilizes TRF1 at telomeres after damage in an ATM activation-dependent manner. Nek7 deficiency leads to telomere aberrations, long-lasting γH2AX and 53BP1 foci, and augmented cell death upon oxidative telomeric DNA damage. Mechanistically, Nek7 interacts with and phosphorylates TRF1 on Ser114, which prevents TRF1 from binding to Fbx4, an Skp1-Cul1-F box E3 ligase subunit, thereby alleviating proteasomal degradation of TRF1, leading to a stable association of TRF1 with Tin2 to form a shelterin complex.

Forced FOG1 expression in human K562 erythroleukemia cells induced the expression of erythroid genes (SLC4A1, globins) but repressed that of GATA-2 and PU.1. A quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis demonstrated increased GATA-1 chromatin occupancy at both FOG1-activated as well as FOG1-repressed gene loci. However, while TAL1 chromatin occupancy was significantly increased at FOG1-activated gene loci, it was significantly decreased at FOG1-repressed gene loci. When FOG1 was overexpressed in TAL1-knocked down K562 cells, FOG1-mediated activation of HBA, HBG, and SLC4A1 was significantly compromised by TAL1 knockdown, suggesting that FOG1 may require TAL1 to activate GATA-1 target genes. Promoter analysis and quantitative ChIP analysis demonstrated that FOG1-mediated transcriptional repression of PU.1 would be mediated through a GATA-binding element located at its promoter, accompanied by significantly decreased H3 acetylation at lysine 4 and 9 (K4 and K9) as well as H3K4 trimethylation. Our results provide important mechanistic insight into the role of FOG1 in the regulation of GATA-1-regulated genes and suggest that FOG1 has an important role in inducing cells to differentiate toward the erythroid lineage rather than the myelo-lymphoid one by repressing the expression of PU.1.",Biochem.

28209718,Demethylation of H3K27 Is Essential for the Induction of Direct Cardiac Reprogramming by miR Combo.,"RATIONALE: Direct reprogramming of cardiac fibroblasts to cardiomyocytes has recently emerged as a novel and promising approach to regenerate the injured myocardium. We have previously demonstrated the feasibility of this approach in vitro and in vivo using a combination of 4 microRNAs (miR-1, miR-133, miR-208, and miR-499) that we named miR combo. However, the mechanism of miR combo mediated direct cardiac reprogramming is currently unknown.
OBJECTIVE: Here, we investigated the possibility that miR combo initiated direct cardiac reprogramming through an epigenetic mechanism.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction array, we found that histone methyltransferases and demethylases that regulate the trimethylation of H3K27 (H3K27me3), an epigenetic modification that marks transcriptional repression, were changed in miR combo-treated fibroblasts. Accordingly, global H3K27me3 levels were downregulated by miR combo treatment. In particular, the promoter region of cardiac transcription factors showed decreased H3K27me3 as revealed by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Inhibition of H3K27 methyltransferases or of the PRC2 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2) by pharmaceutical inhibition or siRNA reduced the levels of H3K27me3 and induced cardiogenic markers at the RNA and protein level, similarly to miR combo treatment. In contrast, knockdown of the H3K27 demethylases Kdm6A and Kdm6B restored the levels of H3K27me3 and blocked the induction of cardiac gene expression in miR combo-treated fibroblasts.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we demonstrated that removal of the repressive mark H3K27me3 is essential for the induction of cardiac reprogramming by miR combo. Our data not only highlight the importance of regulating the epigenetic landscape during cell fate conversion but also provide a framework to improve this technique.",Circ.

28202673,Molecular architecture of polycomb repressive complexes.,"The polycomb group (PcG) proteins are a large and diverse family that epigenetically repress the transcription of key developmental genes. They form three broad groups of polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) known as PRC1, PRC2 and Polycomb Repressive DeUBiquitinase, each of which modifies and/or remodels chromatin by distinct mechanisms that are tuned by having variable compositions of core and accessory subunits. Until recently, relatively little was known about how the various PcG proteins assemble to form the PRCs; however, studies by several groups have now allowed us to start piecing together the PcG puzzle. Here, we discuss some highlights of recent PcG structures and the insights they have given us into how these complexes regulate transcription through chromatin.",Biochem. Soc.

28197905,SUMO and Chromatin Remodeling.,"Many of the known SUMO substrates are nuclear proteins, which regulate gene expression and chromatin dynamics. Sumoylation, in general, appears to correlate with decreased transcriptional activity, and in many cases modulation of the chromatin template is implicated. Sumoylation of the core histones is associated with transcriptional silencing, and transcription factor sumoylation can decrease gene expression by promoting recruitment of chromatin modifying enzymes. Additionally, sumoylation of transcriptional corepressors and chromatin remodeling enzymes can influence interactions with other transcriptional regulators, and alter their enzymatic activity. In some cases, proteins that are components of transcriptional corepressor complexes have been shown to be SUMO E3 ligases, further emphasizing the integration of sumoylation with the regulation of chromatin remodeling. Despite the evidence suggesting that sumoylation is primarily repressive for access to chromatin, recent analyses suggest that protein sumoylation on the chromatin template may play important roles at highly expressed genes. Elucidating the dynamic interplay of sumoylation with other post-translational modifications of histones and chromatin associated proteins will be key to fully understanding the regulation of access to the chromatin template.",Adv.

28194553,Acidic domains differentially read histone H3 lysine 4 methylation status and are widely present in chromatin-associated proteins.,"Histone methylation is believed to provide binding sites for specific reader proteins, which translate histone code into biological function. Here we show that a family of acidic domain-containing proteins including nucleophosmin (NPM1), pp32, SET/TAF1β, nucleolin (NCL) and upstream binding factor (UBF) are novel H3K4me2-binding proteins. These proteins exhibit a unique pattern of interaction with methylated H3K4, as their binding is stimulated by H3K4me2 and inhibited by H3K4me1 and H3K4me3. These proteins contain one or more acidic domains consisting mainly of aspartic and/or glutamic residues that are necessary for preferential binding of H3K4me2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the acidic domain with sufficient length alone is capable of binding H3K4me2 in vitro and in vivo. NPM1, NCL and UBF require their acidic domains for association with and transcriptional activation of rDNA genes. Interestingly, by defining acidic domain as a sequence with at least 20 acidic residues in 50 continuous amino acids, we identified 655 acidic domain-containing protein coding genes in the human genome and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that many of the acidic domain proteins have chromatin-related functions. Our data suggest that acidic domain is a novel histone binding motif that can differentially read the status of H3K4 methylation and is broadly present in chromatin-associated proteins.",Sci China Life Sci,2017,"['Wu M', 'Wei W', 'Chen J', 'Cong R', 'Shi T', 'Bouvet P', 'Li J', 'Wong J', 'Du JX']"

These enzymes recognize and catalyze methylation of histone lysine marks to regulate chromatin integrity and gene expression. The growing number of reports demonstrating that alterations or translocations of these genes fundamentally affect cell growth and differentiation leading to developmental defects illustrates the importance of this family. In addition, overexpression, gain of function somatic mutations, and translocations of NSDs are associated with human cancer and can trigger cellular transformation in model systems. Here we review the functions of NSD family members and the accumulating evidence that these proteins play key roles in tumorigenesis. Because epigenetic therapy is an important emerging anticancer strategy, understanding the function of NSD family members may lead to the development of novel therapies.",Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med,2017,"['Bennett RL', 'Swaroop A', 'Troche C', 'Licht JD']"
28190051,A Protein Preparation Method for the High-throughput Identification of Proteins Interacting with a Nuclear Cofactor Using LC-MS/MS Analysis.,"Transcriptional coregulators are vital to the efficient transcriptional regulation of nuclear chromatin structure. Coregulators play a variety of roles in regulating transcription. These include the direct interaction with transcription factors, the covalent modification of histones and other proteins, and the occasional chromatin conformation alteration. Accordingly, establishing relatively quick methods for identifying proteins that interact within this network is crucial to enhancing our understanding of the underlying regulatory mechanisms. LC-MS/MS-mediated protein binding partner identification is a validated technique used to analyze protein-protein interactions. By immunoprecipitating a previously-identified member of a protein complex with an antibody (occasionally with an antibody for a tagged protein), it is possible to identify its unknown protein interactions via mass spectrometry analysis. Here, we present a method of protein preparation for the LC-MS/MS-mediated high-throughput identification of protein interactions involving nuclear cofactors and their binding partners.

28188746,Context-Dependent Epigenetic Regulation of Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells 1 in Pancreatic Plasticity.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The ability of exocrine pancreatic cells to change the cellular phenotype is required for tissue regeneration upon injury, but also contributes to their malignant transformation and tumor progression. We investigated context-dependent signaling and transcription mechanisms that determine pancreatic cell fate decisions toward regeneration and malignancy. In particular, we studied the function and regulation of the inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATC1) in pancreatic cell plasticity and tissue adaptation.
METHODS: We analyzed cell plasticity during pancreatic regeneration and transformation in mice with pancreas-specific expression of a constitutively active form of NFATC1, or depletion of enhancer of zeste 2 homologue 2 (EZH2), in the context of wild-type or constitutively activate Kras, respectively. Acute and chronic pancreatitis were induced by intraperitoneal injection of caerulein. EZH2-dependent regulation of NFATC1 expression was studied in mouse in human pancreatic tissue and cells by immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We used genetic and pharmacologic approaches of EZH2 and NFATC1 inhibition to study the consequences of pathway disruption on pancreatic morphology and function. Epigenetic modifications on the NFATC1 gene were investigated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays.
RESULTS: NFATC1 was rapidly and transiently induced in early adaptation to acinar cell injury in human samples and in mice, where it promoted acinar cell transdifferentiation and blocked proliferation of metaplastic pancreatic cells. However, in late stages of regeneration, Nfatc1 was epigenetically silenced by EZH2-dependent histone methylation, to enable acinar cell redifferentiation and prevent organ atrophy and exocrine insufficiency. In contrast, oncogenic activation of KRAS signaling in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells reversed the EZH2-dependent effects on the NFATC1 gene and was required for EZH2-mediated transcriptional activation of NFATC1.
CONCLUSIONS: In studies of human and mouse pancreatic cells and tissue, we identified context-specific epigenetic regulation of NFATc1 activity as an important mechanism of pancreatic cell plasticity. Inhibitors of EZH2 might therefore interfere with oncogenic activity of NFATC1 and be used in treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.",Gastroenterology,2017,"['Chen NM', 'Neesse A', 'Dyck ML', 'Steuber B', 'Koenig AO', 'Lubeseder-Martellato C', 'Winter T', 'Forster T', 'Bohnenberger H', 'Kitz J', 'Reuter-Jessen K', 'Griesmann H', 'Gaedcke J', 'Grade M', 'Zhang JS', 'Tsai WC', 'Siveke J', 'Schildhaus HU', 'Ströbel P', 'Johnsen SA', 'Ellenrieder V', 'Hessmann E']"

Recently genome-wide histone modification maps of diverse human developmental stages and tissues have been charted.
DESCRIPTION: To facilitate the investigation of epigenetic dynamics and regulatory mechanisms in cellular differentiation processes, we developed iHMS, an integrated human histone modification database that incorporates massive histone modification maps spanning different developmental stages, lineages and tissues ( http://www.tongjidmb.com/human/index.html ). It also includes genome-wide expression data of different conditions, reference gene annotations, GC content and CpG island information. By providing an intuitive and user-friendly query interface, iHMS enables comprehensive query and comparative analysis based on gene names, genomic region locations, histone modification marks and cell types. Moreover, it offers an efficient browser that allows users to visualize and compare multiple genome-wide histone modification maps and related expression profiles across different developmental stages and tissues.
CONCLUSION: iHMS is of great helpfulness to understand how global histone modification state transitions impact cellular phenotypes across different developmental stages and tissues in the human genome.

ASH2L protein levels in primary leukemia patient samples have not yet been defined. We analyzed ASH2L protein expression in 511 primary AML patient samples using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) technology. We discovered that ASH2L expression is significantly increased in a subset of patients carrying fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations. Furthermore, we observed that low levels of ASH2L are associated with increased overall survival. We also compared ASH2L levels to the expression of 230 proteins previously analyzed on this array. ASH2L expression was inversely correlated with 32 proteins, mostly involved in cell adhesion and cell cycle inhibition, while a positive correlation was observed for 50 proteins, many of which promote cell proliferation. Together, these results indicate that a lower level of ASH2L protein is beneficial to AML patients.",Leuk.

Enzymes that catalyze the first three steps in BER can act at many sites in nucleosomes without the aid of chromatin-remodeling agents and without irreversibly disrupting the host nucleosome.

28180300,Epigenetic changes in histone acetylation underpin resistance to the topoisomerase I inhibitor irinotecan.,"The topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitor irinotecan triggers cell death by trapping TOP1 on DNA, generating cytotoxic protein-linked DNA breaks (PDBs). Despite its wide application in a variety of solid tumors, the mechanisms of cancer cell resistance to irinotecan remains poorly understood. Here, we generated colorectal cancer (CRC) cell models for irinotecan resistance and report that resistance is neither due to downregulation of the main cellular target of irinotecan TOP1 nor upregulation of the key TOP1 PDB repair factor TDP1. Instead, the faster repair of PDBs underlies resistance, which is associated with perturbed histone H4K16 acetylation. Subsequent treatment of irinotecan-resistant, but not parental, CRC cells with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors can effectively overcome resistance. Immunohistochemical analyses of CRC tissues further corroborate the importance of histone H4K16 acetylation in CRC. Finally, the resistant clones exhibit cross-resistance with oxaliplatin but not with ionising radiation or 5-fluoruracil, suggesting that the latter two could be employed following loss of irinotecan response. These findings identify perturbed chromatin acetylation in irinotecan resistance and establish HDAC inhibitors as potential therapeutic means to overcome resistance.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2017,"['Meisenberg C', 'Ashour ME', 'El-Shafie L', 'Liao C', 'Hodgson A', 'Pilborough A', 'Khurram SA', 'Downs JA', 'Ward SE', 'El-Khamisy SF']"
28180290,KDM2A integrates DNA and histone modification signals through a CXXC/PHD module and direct interaction with HP1.,"Functional genomic elements are marked by characteristic DNA and histone modification signatures. How combinatorial chromatin modification states are recognized by epigenetic reader proteins and how this is linked to their biological function is largely unknown. Here we provide a detailed molecular analysis of chromatin recognition by the lysine demethylase KDM2A. Using biochemical approaches we identify a nucleosome interaction module within KDM2A consisting of a CXXC type zinc finger, a PHD domain and a newly identified Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) interaction motif that mediates direct binding between KDM2A and HP1. This nucleosome interaction module enables KDM2A to decode nucleosomal H3K9me3 modification in addition to CpG methylation signals. The multivalent engagement with DNA and HP1 results in a nucleosome binding circuit in which KDM2A can be recruited to H3K9me3-modified chromatin through HP1, and HP1 can be recruited to unmodified chromatin by KDM2A. A KDM2A mutant deficient in HP1-binding is inactive in an in vivo overexpression assay in zebrafish embryos demonstrating that the HP1 interaction is essential for KDM2A function. Our results reveal a complex regulation of chromatin binding for both KDM2A and HP1 that is modulated by DNA- and H3K9-methylation, and suggest a direct role for KDM2A in chromatin silencing.",Nucleic Acids Res.,2017,"['Borgel J', 'Tyl M', 'Schiller K', 'Pusztai Z', 'Dooley CM', 'Deng W', 'Wooding C', 'White RJ', 'Warnecke T', 'Leonhardt H', 'Busch-Nentwich EM', 'Bartke T']"

We present a system level characterization of proteome dynamics during infection by performing a multi-dimensional analysis during HSV-1 lytic infection of human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells. Our study includes identification and quantification of the host and viral proteomes, phosphoproteomes, chromatin bound proteomes and post-translational modifications (PTMs) on cellular histones during infection. We analyzed proteomes across six time points of virus infection (0, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 h post-infection) and clustered trends in abundance using fuzzy c-means. Globally, we accurately quantified more than 4000 proteins, 200 differently modified histone peptides and 9000 phosphorylation sites on cellular proteins. In addition, we identified 67 viral proteins and quantified 571 phosphorylation events (465 with high confidence site localization) on viral proteins, which is currently the most comprehensive map of HSV-1 phosphoproteome. We investigated chromatin bound proteins by proteomic analysis of the high-salt chromatin fraction and identified 510 proteins that were significantly different in abundance during infection. We found 53 histone marks significantly regulated during virus infection, including a steady increase of histone H3 acetylation (H3K9ac and H3K14ac). Our data provide a resource of unprecedented depth for human and viral proteome dynamics during infection. Collectively, our results indicate that the proteome composition of the chromatin of HFF cells is highly affected during HSV-1 infection, and that phosphorylation events are abundant on viral proteins.

Homeobox (HOX) transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR) is a negative prognostic factor in a variety of human cancers, such as breast, liver and lung cancers. HOTAIR can promote cancer cell metastasis by reprogramming chromatin organization. In the present study, HOTAIR expression was elevated in tissues of renal cell carcinoma compared to adjacent normal tissues, and positively correlated with metastasis (P<0.05). The cell migration was inhibited in scratch test and transwell assay after HOTAIR knockdown (P<0.05). Further researches revealed that histone demethylase JMJD3 was reduced and its target gene Snai1 expression was down-regulated after HOTAIR suppression (P<0.05). Meanwhile, the level of histone methytransferase EZH2 target gene PCDHB5 was increased (P<0.05).

28169463,"Relationship between epigenetic regulation, dietary habits, and the developmental origins of health and disease theory.","Environmental stressors during developmental stages are hypothesized to increase the risk of developing metabolic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and psychiatric diseases during later life. This theory is known as the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD). Recent studies suggest that accumulation of environmental stress, including those during developmental stages, is internalized as acquired information designated as ""epigenetic memory."" This epigenetic memory is generally indicated as DNA methylation and histone modifications in the chromatin. In general, the demethylation of CpG islands induces histone acetylation and associated changes from heterochromatin to euchromatin, and enhances transcriptional activation. These changes are induced by the binding of transcriptional factors to cis-elements located on promoter and enhancer regions and the associated binding of histone acetyl-transferase and the transcription initiation complex. Recent studies have demonstrated novel epigenetic modifications that regulate transcription elongation steps by activating histone acetylation and bromodomain-containing protein 4, which contains two bromodomains to bind acetylated histones, on the gene body (transcribed region). Gene expression alterations induced by carbohydrate signals and by changes in energy balance in the body are regulated by this model. In addition, induction of many metabolic genes, which are induced or reduced in adulthood by malnutrition during developmental stages, by intake of major nutrients, or development of lifestyle diseases in adulthood, are targeted by these novel epigenetic changes.

We now show that the compaction of telomeric chromatin and the appropriate histone modifications of telomeric DNA are both dependent upon Rb1-mediated transcription of the telomere-derived long non-coding RNA TERRA. Expression of TERRA was reduced in Rb1 haploinsufficient cells, and further decreased by shRNA-mediated reduction of residual Rb1 expression. Restoration of Rb1 levels through lentiviral transduction was sufficient to reestablish both transcription of TERRA and condensation of telomeric chromatin. The human chromosome 15q TERRA promoter contains predicted retinoblastoma control elements, and was able to confer Rb1-dependent transcription upon a promoterless reporter gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed preferential binding of phosphorylated over non-phosphorylated Rb1 at the TERRA promoter.

28166537,Synthetic essentiality of chromatin remodelling factor CHD1 in PTEN-deficient cancer.,"Synthetic lethality and collateral lethality are two well-validated conceptual strategies for identifying therapeutic targets in cancers with tumour-suppressor gene deletions. Here, we explore an approach to identify potential synthetic-lethal interactions by screening mutually exclusive deletion patterns in cancer genomes. We sought to identify 'synthetic-essential' genes: those that are occasionally deleted in some cancers but are almost always retained in the context of a specific tumour-suppressor deficiency. We also posited that such synthetic-essential genes would be therapeutic targets in cancers that harbour specific tumour-suppressor deficiencies. In addition to known synthetic-lethal interactions, this approach uncovered the chromatin helicase DNA-binding factor CHD1 as a putative synthetic-essential gene in PTEN-deficient cancers. In PTEN-deficient prostate and breast cancers, CHD1 depletion profoundly and specifically suppressed cell proliferation, cell survival and tumorigenic potential. Mechanistically, functional PTEN stimulates the GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of CHD1 degron domains, which promotes CHD1 degradation via the β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination-proteasome pathway. Conversely, PTEN deficiency results in stabilization of CHD1, which in turn engages the trimethyl lysine-4 histone H3 modification to activate transcription of the pro-tumorigenic TNF-NF-κB gene network.

We aim to assess TNFAIP3 expression in CD4 + T cells and the molecular mechanism underlying TNFAIP3 regulation in the pathogenesis of SLE.
Methods: The expression and epigenetic regulation of TNFAIP3 in CD4 + T cells from SLE patients and normal controls (NCs) were investigated by RT-quantitative PCR, western blot and chromatin immunoprecipitation. The functional effect of TNFAIP3 was further evaluated by knockdown or overproduction of TNFAIP3 in CD4 + T cells from SLE patients and NCs.
Results: TNFAIP3 mRNA was significantly downregulated in the CD4 + T cells of SLE patients compared with NCs. The reduced expression of TNFAIP3 was associated with the reduction of H3K4me3 in the gene promoter region. Functional blockage of TNFAIP3 in normal CD4 + T cells using small interfering RNA increased the expression of IFN-γ and IL-17, but not IL-2, IL-4 and IL-5. Nevertheless, overexpression of TNFAIP3 in CD4 + T cells from SLE patients resulted in the suppression of IFN-γ and IL-17 production.
Conclusion: The downregulation of TNFAIP3 in CD4 + T cells of SLE was potentially regulated by demethylation of histone H3K4, which led to a decreased amount of H3K4me3 in the promoter of the TNFAIP3 gene. The dysregulation of TNFAIP3 in CD4 + T cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE by overproduction of inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ and IL-17.

Here, we show that in addition to implementing H3K4me3 at promoters of bivalent genes, Mll2 (KMT2B)/COMPASS can also implement H3K4me3 at a subset of non-TSS regulatory elements, a subset of which shares epigenetic signatures of active enhancers. Our mechanistic studies reveal that association of Mll2's CXXC domain with CpG-rich regions plays an instrumental role for chromatin targeting and subsequent implementation of H3K4me3. Although Mll2/COMPASS is required for H3K4me3 implementation on thousands of loci, generation of catalytically mutant MLL2/COMPASS demonstrated that H3K4me3 implemented by this enzyme was essential for expression of a subset of genes, including those functioning in the control of transcriptional programs during embryonic development.

28157505,Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 Generates Discrete Compacted Domains that Change during Differentiation.,"Master regulatory genes require stable silencing by the polycomb group (PcG) to prevent misexpression during differentiation and development. Some PcG proteins covalently modify histones, which contributes to heritable repression. The role for other effects on chromatin structure is less understood. We characterized the organization of PcG target genes in ESCs and neural progenitors using 5C and super-resolution microscopy. The genomic loci of repressed PcG targets formed discrete, small (20-140 Kb) domains of tight interaction that corresponded to locations bound by canonical polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). These domains changed during differentiation as PRC1 binding changed. Their formation depended upon the Polyhomeotic component of canonical PRC1 and occurred independently of PRC1-catalyzed ubiquitylation. PRC1 domains differ from topologically associating domains in size and boundary characteristics. These domains have the potential to play a key role in transmitting epigenetic silencing of PcG targets by linking PRC1 to formation of a repressive higher-order structure.",Mol.

28157484,Small Molecules Modulate Chromatin Accessibility to Promote NEUROG2-Mediated Fibroblast-to-Neuron Reprogramming.,"Pro-neural transcription factors and small molecules can induce the reprogramming of fibroblasts into functional neurons; however, the immediate-early molecular events that catalyze this conversion have not been well defined. We previously demonstrated that neurogenin 2 (NEUROG2), forskolin (F), and dorsomorphin (D) can reprogram fibroblasts into functional neurons with high efficiency. Here, we used this model to define the genetic and epigenetic events that initiate an acquisition of neuronal identity. We demonstrate that NEUROG2 is a pioneer factor, FD enhances chromatin accessibility and H3K27 acetylation, and synergistic transcription activated by these factors is essential to successful reprogramming. CREB1 promotes neuron survival and acts with NEUROG2 to upregulate SOX4, which co-activates NEUROD1 and NEUROD4. In addition, SOX4 targets SWI/SNF subunits and SOX4 knockdown results in extensive loss of open chromatin and abolishes reprogramming. Applying these insights, adult human glioblastoma cell and skin fibroblast reprogramming can be improved using SOX4 or chromatin-modifying chemicals.",Stem Cell Reports,2016,"['Smith DK', 'Yang J', 'Liu ML', 'Zhang CL']"
28157208,RNF20 and histone H2B ubiquitylation exert opposing effects in Basal-Like versus luminal breast cancer.,"Breast cancer subtypes display distinct biological traits that influence their clinical behavior and response to therapy. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of chromatin structure regulators in tumorigenesis. The RNF20-RNF40 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex monoubiquitylates histone H2B to generate H2Bub1, while the deubiquitinase (DUB) USP44 can remove this modification. We found that RNF20 and RNF40 expression and global H2Bub1 are relatively low, and USP44 expression is relatively high, in basal-like breast tumors compared with luminal tumors. Consistent with a tumor-suppressive role, silencing of RNF20 in basal-like breast cancer cells increased their proliferation and migration, and their tumorigenicity and metastatic capacity, partly through upregulation of inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, in luminal breast cancer cells, RNF20 silencing reduced proliferation, migration and tumorigenic and metastatic capacity, and compromised estrogen receptor transcriptional activity, indicating a tumor-promoting role. Notably, the effects of USP44 silencing on proliferation and migration in both cancer subtypes were opposite to those of RNF20 silencing. Hence, RNF20 and H2Bub1 have contrasting roles in distinct breast cancer subtypes, through differential regulation of key transcriptional programs underpinning the distinctive traits of each subtype.",Cell Death Differ.,2017,"['Tarcic O', 'Granit RZ', 'Pateras IS', 'Masury H', 'Maly B', 'Zwang Y', 'Yarden Y', 'Gorgoulis VG', 'Pikarsky E', 'Ben-Porath I', 'Oren M']"
28155643,Identification of recurrent combinatorial patterns of chromatin modifications at promoters across various tissue types.,"BACKGROUND: Identification and analysis of recurrent combinatorial patterns of multiple chromatin modifications provide invaluable information for understanding epigenetic regulations. Furthermore, as more data becomes available, it is computationally expensive and unnecessary to study combinatorial patterns of all modifications.
METHODS: A novel framework is proposed to investigate recurrent combinatorial patterns of a subset of quantitatively selected chromatin modifications. The framework is based on heirarchical clustering and selects subsets of chromatin modifications that form distinct recurrent patterns at regulatory regions. The identified recurrent combinatorial patterns can be further utilized to discover novel regulatory regions. Data is in the form of genome wide maps of histone acetylations, methylations, and histone variant of human skeletal muscular and B-lymphocyte cells both derived from the ENCODE project.
RESULTS: A case study conducted at promoter regions is presented: four out of twelve chromatin modifications were selected, eight different promoter states were identified and the identified patterns of active promoters were further utilized to discover novel promoter regions. Several previously un-annotated promoters were discovered, further investigations confirm their promoter functions.
CONCLUSIONS: This framework is approproiately general and could lead to better understanding of epigenetic regulations by discovering previously unknown regulatory regions.",BMC Bioinformatics,2016,"['Meng N', 'Machiraju R', 'Huang K']"

MSA dysfunction is associated with loss of trophic factor production by glial and neuronal cells. Here, we report that recombinant wild type human aSyn uptake by OLN-93, an oligodendroglia cell-line, reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression. Furthermore, OLN-93 cells stably transfected with human wild type or an MSA-associated mutant aSyn, A53E that produces neuronal and glial inclusions, reduced BDNF mRNA to nearly unmeasurable qPCR levels. Curiously, another MSA-associated aSyn mutant, G51D that also produces neuronal and glial inclusions, caused only a trend toward BDNF mRNA reduction in transfected OLN-93 cells. This suggests that oligodendrocyte-associated BDNF loss occurs in response to specific aSyn types.

28151936,Promoter Methylation Pattern Controls Corticotropin Releasing Hormone Gene Activity in Human Trophoblasts.,"Placental CRH production increases with advancing pregnancy in women and its course predicts gestational length. We hypothesized that CRH gene expression in the placenta is epigenetically controlled setting gestational trajectories characteristic of normal and pathological pregnancies. Here we determined histone modification and DNA methylation levels and DNA methylation patterns at the CRH promoter in primary trophoblast cultures by chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with clonal bisulfite sequencing and identified the transcriptionally active epialleles that associate with particular histone modifications and transcription factors during syncytialisation and cAMP-stimulation. CRH gene expression increased during syncytial differentiation and cAMP stimulation, which was associated with increased activating and decreased repressive histone modification levels at the promoter. DNA methylation levels remained unchanged. The nine CpGs of the CRH proximal promoter were partially and allele-independently methylated displaying many (>100) epialleles. RNA-polymerase-II (Pol-II) bound only to three particular epialleles in cAMP-stimulated cells, while phospho-cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB) bound to only one epiallele, which was different from those selected by Pol-II. Binding of TATA-binding protein increased during syncytial differentiation preferentially at epialleles compatible with Pol-II and pCREB binding. Histone-3 acetylation was detected only at epialleles targeted by Pol-II and pCREB, while gene activating histone-4 acetylation and histone-3-lysine-4 trimethylation occurred at CRH epialleles not associated with Pol-II or pCREB. The suppressive histone-3-lysine-27 trimethyl and-lysine-9 trimethyl modifications showed little or no epiallele preference. The epiallele selectivity of activating histone modifications and transcription factor binding demonstrates the epigenetic and functional diversity of the CRH gene in trophoblasts, which is controlled predominantly by the patterns, not the overall extent, of promoter methylation. We propose that conditions impacting on epiallele distribution influence the number of transcriptionally active CRH gene copies in the trophoblast cell population determining the gestational trajectory of placental CRH production in normal and pathological pregnancies.",PLoS ONE,2017,"['Pan X', 'Bowman M', 'Scott RJ', 'Fitter J', 'Smith R', 'Zakar T']"

28139737,Histone H4 expression is cooperatively maintained by IKKβ and Akt1 which attenuates cisplatin-induced apoptosis through the DNA-PK/RIP1/IAPs signaling cascade.,"While chromatin remodeling mediated by post-translational modification of histone is extensively studied in carcinogenesis and cancer cell's response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, little is known about the role of histone expression in chemoresistance. Here we report a novel chemoresistance mechanism involving histone H4 expression. Extended from our previous studies showing that concurrent blockage of the NF-κB and Akt signaling pathways sensitizes lung cancer cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis, we for the first time found that knockdown of Akt1 and the NF-κB-activating kinase IKKβ cooperatively downregulated histone H4 expression, which increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells. The enhanced cisplatin cytotoxicity in histone H4 knockdown cells was associated with proteasomal degradation of RIP1, accumulation of cellular ROS and degradation of IAPs (cIAP1 and XIAP). The cisplatin-induced DNA-PK activation was suppressed in histone H4 knockdown cells, and inhibiting DNA-PK reduced expression of RIP1 and IAPs in cisplatin-treated cells. These results establish a novel mechanism by which NF-κB and Akt contribute to chemoresistance involving a signaling pathway consisting of histone H4, DNA-PK, RIP1 and IAPs that attenuates ROS-mediated apoptosis, and targeting this pathway may improve the anticancer efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapy.",Sci Rep,2017,"['Wang R', 'Zheng X', 'Zhang L', 'Zhou B', 'Hu H', 'Li Z', 'Zhang L', 'Lin Y', 'Wang X']"
28137713,HIPred: an integrative approach to predicting haploinsufficient genes.,"Motivation: A major cause of autosomal dominant disease is haploinsufficiency, whereby a single copy of a gene is not sufficient to maintain the normal function of the gene. A large proportion of existing methods for predicting haploinsufficiency incorporate biological networks, e.g. protein-protein interaction networks that have recently been shown to introduce study bias. As a result, these methods tend to perform best on well-studied genes, but underperform on less studied genes. The advent of large genome sequencing consortia, such as the 1000 genomes project, NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project and the Exome Aggregation Consortium creates an urgent need for unbiased haploinsufficiency prediction methods.
Results: Here, we describe a machine learning approach, called HIPred, that integrates genomic and evolutionary information from ENSEMBL, with functional annotations from the Encyclopaedia of DNA Elements consortium and the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Project to predict haploinsufficiency, without the study bias described earlier. We benchmark HIPred using several datasets and show that our unbiased method performs as well as, and in most cases, outperforms existing biased algorithms.

28137567,Mass Spectrometry-Based Methodology for Identification of Native Histone Variant Modifications From Mammalian Tissues and Solid Tumors.,"Histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are key epigenetic marks involved in gene silencing or activation. Histone modifications impact chromatin organization and transcriptional processes through the changes in charge density between histones and DNA. They also serve as recognition and binding sites for specific binding proteins. Histone tails and globular cores contain many basic amino acid residues, which are subject to various dynamic modifications, making the modification repertoire extremely diverse. Consequently, determination of histone PTM identity and quantity has been a challenging task. In recent years, mass spectrometry-based methods have proven useful in histone PTM characterization. This chapter provides a brief overview of these methods and describes the approach to analyze the PTMs of the histone variant CENP-A, essential for the cell cycle progression, when present in minute amounts from tumor and mammalian tissues. Because this method does not rely on antibody-based immunopurification, we anticipate that these tools could be readily adaptable to the investigation to other histone variants in a range of mammalian tissues and solid tumors.",Meth.

28137284,Epigenetic modifying enzyme expression in asthmatic airway epithelial cells and fibroblasts.,"BACKGROUND: Recognition of the airway epithelium as a central mediator in the pathogenesis of asthma has necessitated greater understanding of the aberrant cellular mechanisms of the epithelium in asthma. The architecture of chromatin is integral to the regulation of gene expression and is determined by modifications to the surrounding histones and DNA. The acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination of histone tail residues has the potential to greatly alter the accessibility of DNA to the cells transcriptional machinery. DNA methylation can also interrupt binding of transcription factors and recruit chromatin remodelers resulting in general gene silencing. Although previous studies have found numerous irregularities in the expression of genes involved in asthma, the contribution of epigenetic regulation of these genes is less well known. We propose that the gene expression of epigenetic modifying enzymes is cell-specific and influenced by asthma status in tissues derived from the airways.
METHODS: Airway epithelial cells (AECs) isolated by pronase digestion or endobronchial brushings and airway fibroblasts obtained by outgrowth technique from healthy and asthmatic donors were maintained in monolayer culture. RNA was analyzed for the expression of 82 epigenetic enzymes across 5 families of epigenetic modifying enzymes. Western blot and immunohistochemistry were also used to examine expression of 3 genes.
RESULTS: Between AECs and airway fibroblasts, we identified cell-specific gene expression in each of the families of epigenetic modifying enzymes; specifically 24 of the 82 genes analyzed showed differential expression. We found that 6 histone modifiers in AECs and one in fibroblasts were differentially expressed in cells from asthmatic compared to healthy donors however, not all passed correction. In addition, we identified a corresponding increase in Aurora Kinase A (AURKA) protein expression in epithelial cells from asthmatics compared to those from non-asthmatics.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we have identified cell-specific variation in gene expression in each of the families of epigenetic modifying enzymes in airway epithelial cells and airway fibroblasts. These data provide insight into the cell-specific variation in epigenetic regulation which may be relevant to cell fate and function, and disease susceptibility.",BMC Pulm Med,2017,"['Stefanowicz D', 'Ullah J', 'Lee K', 'Shaheen F', 'Olumese E', 'Fishbane N', 'Koo HK', 'Hallstrand TS', 'Knight DA', 'Hackett TL']"

Herein, we found the CR domain binds chromatin preferentially at the histone H3 tail by recognising H3 lysine 36 mono- and dimethylation (H3K36me1/2). Importantly, missense mutations in the CR domain perturbed TET2 recruitment to the target locus and its enzymatic activities.

Recent studies have identified a somatic and heterozygous mutation at the H3F3B gene in over 90% chondroblastoma cases, leading to a lysine 36 to methionine replacement (H3.3K36M). In human cells, H3F3B gene is one of 2 genes that encode identical H3.3 proteins. It is not known how H3.3K36M mutant proteins promote tumorigenesis. We and others have shown that, the levels of H3K36 di- and tri-methylation (H3K36me2/me3) are reduced dramatically in chondroblastomas and chondrocytes bearing the H3.3K36M mutation. Mechanistically, H3.3K36M mutant proteins inhibit enzymatic activity of some, but not all H3K36 methyltransferases. Chondrocytes harboring the same H3F3B mutation exhibited the cancer cell associated phenotypes. Here, we discuss the potential effects of H3.3K36M mutation on epigenomes including H3K36 and H3K27 methylation and cellular phenotypes. We suggest that H3.3K36M mutant proteins alter epigenomes of specific progenitor cells, which in turn lead to cellular transformation and tumorigenesis.",Cell Cycle,2017,"['Fang D', 'Gan H', 'Wang H', 'Zhou H', 'Zhang Z']"

Recent advances indicate that environmental factors trigger autoimmune diseases in genetically predisposed individuals.

Histone modifications regulate the chromatin states and gene transcription without any change in the DNA sequence, possibly resulting in phenotype alteration in several different cell types.

28125586,A Novel Lamin A Mutant Responsible for Congenital Muscular Dystrophy Causes Distinct Abnormalities of the Cell Nucleus.,"A-type lamins, the intermediate filament proteins participating in nuclear structure and function, are encoded by LMNA. LMNA mutations can lead to laminopathies such as lipodystrophies, premature aging syndromes (progeria) and muscular dystrophies. Here, we identified a novel heterozygous LMNA p.R388P de novo mutation in a patient with a non-previously described severe phenotype comprising congenital muscular dystrophy (L-CMD) and lipodystrophy. In culture, the patient's skin fibroblasts entered prematurely into senescence, and some nuclei showed a lamina honeycomb pattern. C2C12 myoblasts were transfected with a construct carrying the patient's mutation; R388P-lamin A (LA) predominantly accumulated within the nucleoplasm and was depleted at the nuclear periphery, altering the anchorage of the inner nuclear membrane protein emerin and the nucleoplasmic protein LAP2-alpha. The mutant LA triggered a frequent and severe nuclear dysmorphy that occurred independently of prelamin A processing, as well as increased histone H3K9 acetylation. Nuclear dysmorphy was not significantly improved when transfected cells were treated with drugs disrupting microtubules or actin filaments or modifying the global histone acetylation pattern. Therefore, releasing any force exerted at the nuclear envelope by the cytoskeleton or chromatin did not rescue nuclear shape, in contrast to what was previously shown in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria due to other LMNA mutations. Our results point to the specific cytotoxic effect of the R388P-lamin A mutant, which is clinically related to a rare and severe multisystemic laminopathy phenotype.",PLoS ONE,2017,"['Barateau A', 'Vadrot N', 'Vicart P', 'Ferreiro A', 'Mayer M', 'Héron D', 'Vigouroux C', 'Buendia B']"

Our prediction model is based on a discriminative gapped-kmer SVM (gkm-SVM) trained on genome-wide chromatin accessibility data in the cell type of interest. The comparisons with massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) in lymphoblasts show that gkm-SVM is among the most accurate prediction models even though all other models used the MPRA data for model training, and gkm-SVM did not. In addition, we compare gkm-SVM with other MPRA datasets and show that gkm-SVM is a reliable predictor of expression and that deltaSVM is a reliable predictor of variant impact in K562 cells and mouse retina. We further show that DHS (DNase-I hypersensitive sites) and ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing) data are equally predictive substrates for training gkm-SVM, and that DHS regions flanked by H3K27Ac and H3K4me1 marks are more predictive than DHS regions alone.",Hum.

28118111,Identification of the amino acid residues responsible for stable nucleosome formation by histone H3.Y.,"Histone H3.Y is conserved among primates. We previously reported that exogenously produced H3.Y accumulates around transcription start sites, suggesting that it may play a role in transcription regulation. The H3.Y nucleosome forms a relaxed chromatin conformation with flexible DNA ends. The H3.Y-specific Lys42 residue is partly responsible for enhancing the flexibility of the nucleosomal DNA. To our surprise, we found that H3.Y stably associates with chromatin and nucleosomes in vivo and in vitro. However, the H3.Y residues responsible for its stable nucleosome incorporation have not been identified yet. In the present study, we performed comprehensive mutational analyses of H3.Y, and determined that the H3.Y C-terminal region including amino acid residues 124-135 is responsible for its stable association with DNA. Among the H3.Y C-terminal residues, the H3.Y Met124 residue significantly contributed to the stable DNA association with the H3.Y-H4 tetramer. The H3.Y M124I mutation substantially reduced the H3.Y-H4 association in the nucleosome. In contrast, the H3.Y K42R mutation affected the nucleosome stability less, although it contributes to the flexible DNA ends of the nucleosome. Therefore, these H3.Y-specific residues, Lys42 and Met124, play different and specific roles in nucleosomal DNA relaxation and stable nucleosome formation, respectively, in chromatin.",Nucleus,2017,"['Kujirai T', 'Horikoshi N', 'Xie Y', 'Taguchi H', 'Kurumizaka H']"
28117006,Bivalent Histone Modifications and Development.,"BACKGROUND: Development is an epigenetic regulation dependent event. As one pretranscriptional regulator, bivalent histone modifications were observed to be involved in development recently. It is believed that histone methylation potentially takes charge of cell fate determination and differentiation. The synchronous existence of functionally opposite histone marks at transcript start sequence (TSS) is defined as ""Bivalency"", which mainly mark development related genes. H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, the prominent histone methylations of bivalency, are implicated in transcriptional activation and transcriptional repression respectively. The delicate balance between H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 produces diverse chromatin architectures, resulting in different transcription states of downstream genes: ""poised"", ""activated"" or ""repressed"".
OBJECTIVE: In order to explore the developmental role of bivalent histone modification and the underlying mechanism, we did systematic review and rigorous assessment about relative literatures.
RESULT: Bivalent histone modifications are considered to set up genes for activation during lineage commitment by H3K4me3 and repress lineage control genes to maintain pluripotency by H3K27me3. Summarily, bivalency in stem cells keeps stemness via poising differentiation relevant genes. After receiving developmental signals, the balance between ""gene activation"" and ""gene repression"" is broken, which turns genes transcription state from ""poised"" effect to switch on or switch off effect, thus initiates irreversible and spontaneous differentiation procedures.
CONCLUSION: Bivalent histone modifications and the associated histone-modifying complexes safeguard proper and robust differentiation of stem cells, thus playing an essential role in development.",Curr Stem Cell Res Ther,2018,"['Li F', 'Wan M', 'Zhang B', 'Peng Y', 'Zhou Y', 'Pi C', 'Xu X', 'Ye L', 'Zhou X', 'Zheng L']"
28116320,The Mechanisms Underlying Chronic Inflammation in Rheumatoid Arthritis from the Perspective of the Epigenetic Landscape.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that is characterized by synovial hyperplasia and progressive joint destruction. The activation of RA synovial fibroblasts (SFs), also called fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), contributes significantly to perpetuation of the disease. Genetic and environmental factors have been reported to be involved in the etiology of RA but are insufficient to explain it. In recent years, accumulating results have shown the potential role of epigenetic mechanisms, including histone modifications, DNA methylation, and microRNAs, in the development of RA. Epigenetic mechanisms regulate chromatin state and gene transcription without any change in DNA sequence, resulting in the alteration of phenotypes in several cell types, especially RASFs. Epigenetic changes possibly provide RASFs with an activated phenotype.

28114995,Prognostic and therapeutic value of disruptor of telomeric silencing-1-like (DOT1L) expression in patients with ovarian cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Epigenetics has been known to play a critical role in regulating the malignant phenotype. This study was designed to examine the expression of DOT1L (histone 3 lysine 79 methyltransferase) and H3K79 methylation in normal ovarian tissues and ovarian tumors and to explore the function of DOT1L and its underline mechanisms in ovarian cancer.
METHODS: The expression of DOT1L and H3K79 methylation in 250 ovarian tumor samples and 24 normal ovarian samples was assessed by immunohistochemistry. The effects of DOT1L on cell proliferation in vitro were evaluated using CCK8, colony formation and flow cytometry. The DOT1L-targeted genes were determined using chromatin immune-precipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) and ChIP-PCR. Gene expression levels were measured by real-time PCR and immunoblotting. The effects of DOT1L on tumor growth in vivo were evaluated using an orthotopic ovarian tumor model.
RESULTS: DOT1L expression and H3K79 methylation was significantly increased in malignant ovarian tumors. High DOT1L expression was associated with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, histologic grade, and lymphatic metastasis. DOT1L was an independent prognostic factor for the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of ovarian cancer, and higher DOT1L expression was associated with poorer OS and PFS. Furthermore, DOT1L regulates the transcription of G1 phase genes CDK6 and CCND3 through H3K79 dimethylation; therefore, blocking DOT1L could result in G1 arrest and thereby impede the cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings first demonstrate that DOT1L over-expression has important clinical significance in ovarian cancer and also clarify that it drives cell cycle progression through transcriptional regulation of CDK6 and CCND3 through H3K79 methylation, suggesting that DOT1L might be potential target for prognostic assessment and therapeutic intervention in ovarian cancer.",J Hematol Oncol,2017,"['Zhang X', 'Liu D', 'Li M', 'Cao C', 'Wan D', 'Xi B', 'Li W', 'Tan J', 'Wang J', 'Wu Z', 'Ma D', 'Gao Q']"
28113136,Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors suppress CCL2 chemokine in monocytes via epigenetic modification.,"The treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors could lead to adverse effects. Therefore, the identification of downstream therapeutic targets is important. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1, also called CCL2) is related to RA disease activity, and epigenetic modifications are hypothesized to regulate gene expression in RA pathogenesis. We studied the effects of two TNF-α inhibitors, etanercept and adalimumab, on CCL2 expression and the potentially associated intracellular mechanisms, including epigenetic regulation. Etanercept and adalimumab decreased CCL2 production in THP-1 cells and human primary monocytes, as detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and these changes in the CCL2 levels were independent of the TNF-α levels. Etanercept and adalimumab suppressed mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phospho-p38, phospho-JNK, phospho-ERK and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) phospho-p65, as demonstrated using western blot analyses. The investigation of epigenetic modifications using chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that etanercept and adalimumab down-regulated acetylation of histone (H)3 and H4 in the CCL2 promoter region by decreasing the recruitment of the NF-κB associated acetyltransferases p300, CBP and PCAF. Etanercept and adalimumab also down-regulated trimethylation of H3K4, H3K27, H3K36 and H3K79 in the CCL2 promoter region by decreasing the expression of the related methyltransferases WDR5 and Smyd2. We demonstrated that TNF-α inhibitors exert immunomodulatory effects on CCL2 expression in human monocytes via MAPKs, NF-κB and epigenetic modifications. These findings broaden the mechanistic knowledge related to TNF-α inhibitors and provide novel therapeutic targets for RA.",Mol.

However, how HIRA deposits H3.3 to these regions remains elusive. Through a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screening, we identified single-stranded DNA binding protein replication protein A (RPA) as a regulator of the deposition of newly synthesized H3.3 into chromatin. We show that RPA physically interacts with HIRA to form RPA-HIRA-H3.3 complexes, and it co-localizes with HIRA and H3.3 at gene promoters and enhancers. Depletion of RPA1, the largest subunit of the RPA complex, dramatically reduces both HIRA association with chromatin and the deposition of newly synthesized H3.3 at promoters and enhancers and leads to altered transcription at gene promoters. These results support a model whereby RPA, best known for its role in DNA replication and repair, recruits HIRA to promoters and enhancers and regulates deposition of newly synthesized H3.3 to these regulatory elements for gene regulation.",Mol.

28102705,The acetyl code in rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatic diseases.,"Growing evidence supports the idea that aberrancies in epigenetic processes contribute to the onset and progression of human immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Epigenetic regulators of histone tail modifications play a role in chromatin accessibility and transcriptional responses to inflammatory stimuli. Among these, histone deacetylases (HDACs) regulate the acetylation status of histones and nonhistone proteins, essential for immune responses. Broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitors are well-known anti-inflammatory agents and reduce disease severity in animal models of arthritis; however, selective HDAC inhibitors remain poorly studied. In this review, we describe emerging findings regarding the aberrant acetyl code in RA and other rheumatic disorders which may help identify not only novel diagnostic and prognostic clinical biomarkers for RA, but also new targets for epigenetic pharmacological applications.",Epigenomics,2017,"['Angiolilli C', 'Baeten DL', 'Radstake TR', 'Reedquist KA']"

Functional inactivation of pRB perturbs these cellular events and causes dysregulated cell growth and chromosome instability, which are hallmarks of cancer cells. The role of pRB in regulation of nucleosome/chromatin structures has been shown to link to tumor suppression. This review focuses on the ability of pRB to control nucleosome/chromatin structures via physical interactions with histone modifiers and chromatin factors and describes cancer therapies based on targeting these protein factors.",Biomed Res Int,2016,['Uchida C']
28098985,HMGB1 Stimulates Activity of Polymerase β on Nucleosome Substrates.,"The process of base excision repair (BER) recognizes and repairs small lesions or inappropriate bases on DNA through either a short-patch or long-patch pathway. The enzymes involved in BER have been well-characterized on DNA substrates, and, somewhat surprisingly, many of these enzymes, including several DNA glycosylases, AP endonuclease (APE), FEN1 endonuclease, and DNA ligases, have been shown to have activity on DNA substrates within nucleosomes. DNA polymerase β (Pol β), however, exhibits drastically reduced or no activity on nucleosomal DNA. Interestingly, acetylation of Pol β, by the acetyltransferase p300, inhibits its 5' dRP-lyase activity and presumably pushes repair of DNA substrates through the long-patch base excision repair (LP-BER) pathway. In addition to the major enzymes involved in BER, a chromatin architectural factor, HMGB1, was found to directly interact with and enhance the activity of APE1 and FEN1, and thus may aid in altering the structure of the nucleosome to be more accessible to BER factors. In this work, we investigated whether acetylation of Pol β, either alone or in conjunction with HMGB1, facilitates its activity on nucleosome substrates. We find acetylated Pol β exhibits enhanced strand displacement synthesis activity on DNA substrates, but, similar to the unmodified enzyme, has little or no activity on nucleosomes. Preincubation of DNA templates with HMGB1 has little or no stimulatory effect on Pol β and even is inhibitory at higher concentrations. In contrast, preincubation of nucleosomes with HMGB1 rescues Pol β gap-filling activity in nucleosomes, suggesting that this factor may help overcome the repressive effects of chromatin.",Biochemistry,2017,"['Balliano A', 'Hao F', 'Njeri C', 'Balakrishnan L', 'Hayes JJ']"
28096401,Ornithine decarboxylase regulates M1 macrophage activation and mucosal inflammation via histone modifications.,"Macrophage activation is a critical step in host responses during bacterial infections. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine metabolism, has been well studied in epithelial cells and is known to have essential roles in many different cellular functions. However, its role in regulating macrophage function during bacterial infections is not well characterized. We demonstrate that macrophage-derived ODC is a critical regulator of M1 macrophage activation during both Helicobacter pylori and Citrobacter rodentium infection. Myeloid-specific Odc deletion significantly increased gastric and colonic inflammation, respectively, and enhanced M1 activation. Add-back of putrescine, the product of ODC, reversed the increased macrophage activation, indicating that ODC and putrescine are regulators of macrophage function. Odc-deficient macrophages had increased histone 3, lysine 4 (H3K4) monomethylation, and H3K9 acetylation, accompanied by decreased H3K9 di/trimethylation both in vivo and ex vivo in primary macrophages. These alterations in chromatin structure directly resulted in up-regulated gene transcription, especially M1 gene expression. Thus, ODC in macrophages tempers antimicrobial, M1 macrophage responses during bacterial infections through histone modifications and altered euchromatin formation, leading to the persistence and pathogenesis of these organisms.",Proc.

The IRIF of both repair factors show nanostructures with partial anti-correlation. These structures are related to domains formed within the chromatin territories marked by γH2AX while 53BP1 is mainly situated in the perichromatin region. The nanostructures have a mean size of (129 ± 6) nm and are found to be irrespective of the applied LET and the labelled damage marker. In contrast, Rad51 shows no nanostructure and a mean size of (143 ± 13) nm independent of LET.

After mitosis, Repo-Man/PP1 remains associated with chromatin but its function in interphase is not known. Here we show that Repo-Man, via Nup153, is enriched on condensed chromatin at the nuclear periphery and at the edge of the nucleopore basket. Repo-Man/PP1 regulates the formation of heterochromatin, dephosphorylates H3S28 and it is necessary and sufficient for heterochromatin protein 1 binding and H3K27me3 recruitment. Using a novel proteogenomic approach, we show that Repo-Man is enriched at subtelomeric regions together with H2AZ and H3.3 and that depletion of Repo-Man alters the peripheral localization of a subset of these regions and alleviates repression of some polycomb telomeric genes.

28091569,Epigenetic regulation of Plasmodium falciparum clonally variant gene expression during development in Anopheles gambiae.,"P. falciparum phenotypic plasticity is linked to the variant expression of clonal multigene families such as the var genes. We have examined changes in transcription and histone modifications that occur during sporogonic development of P. falciparum in the mosquito host. All var genes are silenced or transcribed at low levels in blood stages (gametocyte/ring) of the parasite in the human host. After infection of mosquitoes, a single var gene is selected for expression in the oocyst, and transcription of this gene increases dramatically in the sporozoite. The same PF3D7_1255200 var gene was activated in 4 different experimental infections. Transcription of this var gene during parasite development in the mosquito correlates with the presence of low levels of H3K9me3 at the binding site for the PF3D7_1466400 AP2 transcription factor. This chromatin state in the sporozoite also correlates with the expression of an antisense long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that has previously been shown to promote var gene transcription during the intraerythrocytic cycle in vitro. Expression of both the sense protein-coding transcript and the antisense lncRNA increase dramatically in sporozoites. The findings suggest a complex process for the activation of a single particular var gene that involves AP2 transcription factors and lncRNAs.",Sci Rep,2017,"['Gómez-Díaz E', 'Yerbanga RS', 'Lefèvre T', 'Cohuet A', 'Rowley MJ', 'Ouedraogo JB', 'Corces VG']"
28088579,The microRNA-449 family inhibits TGF-β-mediated liver cancer cell migration by targeting SOX4.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Modulation of microRNA expression is a potential treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therefore, the epigenetically regulated microRNA-449 family (miR-449a, miR-449b, miR-449c) was characterized with regards to its functional effects and target genes in HCC.
METHODS: After transfection of miR-449a, miR-449b, and/or miR-449c, tumor-relevant functional effects were analyzed using in vitro assays and a xenograft mouse model. Binding specificities, target genes, and regulated pathways of each miRNA were identified by microarray analyses. Target genes were validated by luciferase reporter assays and expression analyses in vitro. Furthermore, target gene expression was analyzed in 61 primary human HCCs compared to normal liver tissue.
RESULTS: Tumor suppressive effects, binding specificities, target genes, and regulated pathways of miR-449a and miR-449b differed from those of miR-449c. Transfection of miR-449a, miR-449b, and/or miR-449c inhibited cell proliferation and migration, induced apoptosis, and reduced tumor growth to different extents. Importantly, miR-449a, miR-449b, and, to a lesser degree, miR-449c directly targeted SOX4, which codes for a transcription factor involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and HCC metastasis, and thereby inhibited TGF-β-mediated cell migration.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides detailed insights into the regulatory network of the epigenetically regulated miRNA-449 family and, for the first time, describes distinct tumor suppressive effects and target specificities of miR-449a, miR-449b, and miR-449c. Our results indicate that particularly miR-449a and miR-449b may be considered for miRNA replacement therapy to prevent HCC progression and metastasis.
LAY SUMMARY: In this study, we demonstrated that the microRNA-449 family acts as a tumor suppressor in liver cancer by causing cell death and inhibiting cell migration. These effects are caused by downregulation of the oncogene SOX4, which is frequently overexpressed in liver cancer. We conclude that the microRNA-449 family may be a target for liver cancer therapy.",J.

28082740,Epigenetic regulation and chromatin remodeling in learning and memory.,"Understanding the underlying mechanisms of memory formation and maintenance has been a major goal in the field of neuroscience. Memory formation and maintenance are tightly controlled complex processes. Among the various processes occurring at different levels, gene expression regulation is especially crucial for proper memory processing, as some genes need to be activated while some genes must be suppressed. Epigenetic regulation of the genome involves processes such as DNA methylation and histone post-translational modifications. These processes edit genomic properties or the interactions between the genome and histone cores. They then induce structural changes in the chromatin and lead to transcriptional changes of different genes. Recent studies have focused on the concept of chromatin remodeling, which consists of 3D structural changes in chromatin in relation to gene regulation, and is an important process in learning and memory. In this review, we will introduce three major epigenetic processes involved in memory regulation: DNA methylation, histone methylation and histone acetylation. We will also discuss general mechanisms of long-term memory storage and relate the epigenetic control of learning and memory to chromatin remodeling. Finally, we will discuss how epigenetic mechanisms can contribute to the pathologies of neurological disorders and cause memory-related symptoms.",Exp. Mol. Med.,2017,"['Kim S', 'Kaang BK']"

Translocations of the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene produce fusion proteins such as MLL-AF4 that disrupt epigenetic pathways and cause poor-prognosis leukemias. Here, we find that at a subset of gene targets, MLL-AF4 binding spreads into the gene body and is associated with the spreading of Menin binding, increased transcription, increased H3K79 methylation (H3K79me2/3), a disruption of normal H3K36me3 patterns, and unmethylated CpG regions in the gene body. Compared to other H3K79me2/3 marked genes, MLL-AF4 spreading gene expression is downregulated by inhibitors of the H3K79 methyltransferase DOT1L. This sensitivity mediates synergistic interactions with additional targeted drug treatments. Therefore, epigenetic spreading and enhanced susceptibility to epidrugs provides a potential marker for better understanding combination therapies in humans.",Cell Rep,2017,"['Kerry J', 'Godfrey L', 'Repapi E', 'Tapia M', 'Blackledge NP', 'Ma H', 'Ballabio E', ""O'Byrne S"", 'Ponthan F', 'Heidenreich O', 'Roy A', 'Roberts I', 'Konopleva M', 'Klose RJ', 'Geng H', 'Milne TA']"

We previously isolated a human pancreatic tumor-initiating cell line, KMC07, from a patient with acquired resistance to gemcitabine chemotherapy. To improve the anticancer effects of gemcitabine, we investigated the molecular mechanism of KMC07 cells' resistance to gemcitabine.
METHODS: KMC07 cells were treated with gemcitabine, then gene expression and functional analyses performed using microarray, the quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and cell transplantation into nude mice.
RESULTS: KMC07 cells, but not BxPC-3, PANC-1, MIA PaCa-2, or AsPC-1 cells, expressed matrix metalloproteinase-10 mRNA, the expression level of which was enhanced by gemcitabine. KMC07 cells were shown to carry a constitutively active Kras mutation, and a MEK inhibitor suppressed matrix metalloproteinase-10 mRNA expression. Gemcitabine enhanced histone H3 acetylation at the matrix metalloproteinase-10 promoter, and a histone acetyltransferase inhibitor reduced gemcitabine-enhanced matrix metalloproteinase-10 mRNA expression. Gemcitabine induced expression of matrix metalloproteinase-10 protein in KMC07-derived pancreatic tumors in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated constitutive activation of the Kras-MEK matrix metalloproteinase-10 signaling pathway in KMC07 cells that was enhanced by gemcitabine through histone acetylation.

28059589,An HP1 isoform-specific feedback mechanism regulates Suv39h1 activity under stress conditions.,"The presence of H3K9me3 and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) are hallmarks of heterochromatin conserved in eukaryotes. The spreading and maintenance of H3K9me3 is effected by the functional interplay between the H3K9me3-specific histone methyltransferase Suv39h1 and HP1. This interplay is complex in mammals because the three HP1 isoforms, HP1α, β, and γ, are thought to play a redundant role in Suv39h1-dependent deposition of H3K9me3 in pericentric heterochromatin (PCH). Here, we demonstrate that despite this redundancy, HP1α and, to a lesser extent, HP1γ have a closer functional link to Suv39h1, compared to HP1β. HP1α and γ preferentially interact in vivo with Suv39h1, regulate its dynamics in heterochromatin, and increase Suv39h1 protein stability through an inhibition of MDM2-dependent Suv39h1-K87 polyubiquitination. The reverse is also observed, where Suv39h1 increases HP1α stability compared HP1β and γ. The interplay between Suv39h1 and HP1 isoforms appears to be relevant under genotoxic stress. Specifically, loss of HP1α and γ isoforms inhibits the upregulation of Suv39h1 and H3K9me3 that is observed under stress conditions. Reciprocally, Suv39h1 deficiency abrogates stress-dependent upregulation of HP1α and γ, and enhances HP1β levels. Our work defines a specific role for HP1 isoforms in regulating Suv39h1 function under stress via a feedback mechanism that likely regulates heterochromatin formation.",Epigenetics,2017,"['Raurell-Vila H', 'Bosch-Presegue L', 'Gonzalez J', 'Kane-Goldsmith N', 'Casal C', 'Brown JP', 'Marazuela-Duque A', 'Singh PB', 'Serrano L', 'Vaquero A']"

28057212,Regulation of Cellular Immune Responses in Sepsis by Histone Modifications.,"Severe sepsis, septic shock, and related inflammatory syndromes are driven by the aberrant expression of proinflammatory mediators by immune cells. During the acute phase of sepsis, overexpression of chemokines and cytokines drives physiological stress leading to organ failure and mortality. Following recovery from sepsis, the immune system exhibits profound immunosuppression, evidenced by an inability to produce the same proinflammatory mediators that are required for normal responses to infectious microorganisms. Gene expression in inflammatory responses is influenced by the transcriptional accessibility of the chromatin, with histone posttranslational modifications determining whether inflammatory gene loci are set to transcriptionally active, repressed, or poised states. Experimental evidence indicates that histone modifications play a central role in governing the cytokine storm of severe sepsis, and that aberrant chromatin modifications induced during the acute phase of sepsis may mediate chronic immunosuppression in sepsis survivors. This review will focus on the role of histone modifications in governing immune responses in severe sepsis, with an emphasis on specific leukocyte subsets and the histone modifications observed in these cells during chronic stages of sepsis. Additionally, the expression and function of chromatin-modifying enzymes (CMEs) will be discussed in the context of severe sepsis, as potential mediators of epigenetic regulation of gene expression in sepsis responses.

However, current algorithms are limited by unrealistic data distribution assumptions. Here we propose GenoSTAN (Genomic STate ANnotation), a hidden Markov model overcoming these limitations. We map promoters and enhancers for 127 cell types and tissues from the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects, today's largest compendium of chromatin assays. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that GenoSTAN generally identifies promoters and enhancers with significantly higher accuracy than previous methods. Moreover, GenoSTAN-derived promoters and enhancers showed significantly higher enrichment of complex trait-associated genetic variants than current annotations.

28054438,Epigenetics regulates transcription and pathogenesis in the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis.,"Trichomonas vaginalis is a common sexually transmitted parasite that colonizes the human urogenital tract. Infections range from asymptomatic to highly inflammatory, depending on the host and the parasite strain. Different T. vaginalis strains vary greatly in their adherence and cytolytic capacities. These phenotypic differences might be attributed to differentially expressed genes as a consequence of extra-genetic variation, such as epigenetic modifications. In this study, we explored the role of histone acetylation in regulating gene transcription and pathogenesis in T. vaginalis. Here, we show that histone 3 lysine acetylation (H3KAc) is enriched in nucleosomes positioned around the transcription start site of active genes (BAP1 and BAP2) in a highly adherent parasite strain; compared with the low acetylation abundance in contrast to that observed in a less-adherent strain that expresses these genes at low levels. Additionally, exposition of less-adherent strain with a specific histone deacetylases inhibitor, trichostatin A, upregulated the transcription of BAP1 and BAP2 genes in concomitance with an increase in H3KAc abundance and chromatin accessibility around their transcription start sites. Moreover, we demonstrated that the binding of initiator binding protein, the transcription factor responsible for the initiation of transcription of ~75% of known T. vaginalis genes, depends on the histone acetylation state around the metazoan-like initiator to which initiator binding protein binds. Finally, we found that trichostatin A treatment increased parasite aggregation and adherence to host cells. Our data demonstrated for the first time that H3KAc is a permissive histone modification that functions to mediate both transcription and pathogenesis of the parasite T. vaginalis.",Cell.

We present HMCan-diff, the first method designed to analyze ChIP-seq data to detect changes in histone modifications between two cancer samples of different genetic backgrounds, or between a cancer sample and a normal control. HMCan-diff explicitly corrects for copy number bias, and for other biases in the ChIP-seq data, which significantly improves prediction accuracy compared to methods that do not consider such corrections. On in silico simulated ChIP-seq data generated using genomes with differences in copy number profiles, HMCan-diff shows a much better performance compared to other methods that have no correction for copy number bias. Additionally, we benchmarked HMCan-diff on four experimental datasets, characterizing two histone marks in two different scenarios.

We show that accumulation of ubiquitin on polyQ IB, associated with Huntington's disease, is correlated with extensive depletion of nuclear ubiquitin and histone de-ubiquitination. Histone ubiquitination plays major roles in chromatin regulation and DNA repair. Accordingly, we observe that cells expressing IB fail to respond to radiomimetic DNA damage, to induce gamma-H2AX phosphorylation and to recruit 53BP1 to damaged foci. Interestingly ubiquitin depletion, histone de-ubiquitination and impaired DNA damage response are not restricted to PolyQ aggregates and are associated with artificial aggregating luciferase mutants. The longevity of brain neurons depends on their capacity to respond to and repair extensive ongoing DNA damage.

CTCF is known to bind several sites in the HSV-1 genome during latency and reactivation, but its function has not been defined. Here, we report that CTCF interacts extensively with the HSV-1 DNA during lytic infection by ChIP-seq, and its knockdown results in the reduction of viral transcription, viral genome copy number and virus yield. CTCF knockdown led to increased H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, and a reduction of RNA pol II occupancy on viral genes. Importantly, ChIP-seq analysis revealed that there is a higher level of CTD Ser2P modified RNA Pol II near CTCF peaks relative to the Ser5P form in the viral genome.

28039048,SH2B1 modulates chromatin state and MyoD occupancy to enhance expressions of myogenic genes.,"As mesoderm-derived cell lineage commits to myogenesis, a spectrum of signaling molecules, including insulin growth factor (IGF), activate signaling pathways and ultimately instruct chromatin remodeling and the transcription of myogenic genes. MyoD is a key transcription factor during myogenesis. In this study, we have identified and characterized a novel myogenic regulator, SH2B1. Knocking down SH2B1 delays global chromatin condensation and decreases the formation of myotubes. SH2B1 interacts with histone H1 and is required for the removal of histone H1 from active transcription sites, allowing for the expressions of myogenic genes, IGF2 and MYOG. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays suggest the requirement of SH2B1 for the induction of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation as well as the reduction of histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation at the promoters and/or enhancers of IGF2 and MYOG genes during myogenesis. Furthermore, SH2B1 is required for the transcriptional activity of MyoD and MyoD occupancy at the enhancer/promoter regions of IGF2 and MYOG during myogenesis. Together, this study demonstrates that SH2B1 fine-tunes global-local chromatin states, expressions of myogenic genes and ultimately promotes myogenesis.",Biochim Biophys Acta Gene Regul Mech,2017,"['Chen KW', 'Chang YJ', 'Yeh CM', 'Lian YL', 'Chan MW', 'Kao CF', 'Chen L']"
29911787,[Effects of pargyline on histone methylation in promoter and enhancer regions and transcription of CYP3A4/3A7].,"This study was designed to investigate effects of pargyline on histone methylation in the promoter and enhancer regions and transcription of cytochrome P450 3A4/3A7 (CYP3A4/3A7) gene. Human primary fetal liver cells were isolated, cultured and randomly divided into several groups including control, solvent, pargyline low, middle, high dose (treated with 0.6, 1.2, 2.4 mmol·L(−1)). HepG2 cells were cultured and treated with 0.03, 0.3, 3 mmol·L(−1) pargyline. After 48 hours, total RNAs were prepared from the cells to determine the expression of CYP3A m RNA in primary fetal cells and HepG2 cells with real-time quantative PCR (qPCR). HepG2 cells were cultured and then treated with 3 mmol·L(−1) pargyline for 48 hours. The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed with dimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me2), and IgG antibodies respectively. The precipitated DNA was resuspended and used for qPCR. Primers were used to detect different regions of CYP3A4/3A7 promoter and enhancer. Occupancy of H3K4me2 was shown as percent of input DNA relative to control cells. The results suggested that pargyline has an effect on primary fetal liver cells and HepG2 cells proliferation. The level of CYP3A7 was markedly enhanced in human primary fetal liver cells by treatment with 1.2, 2.4 mmol·L(−1) of pargyline (P < 0.05, P < 0.01) and the levels of CYP3A4/3A7 were remarkably enhanced by treatment with 3 mmol·L(−1) of pargyline in HepG2 cells (P < 0.001) compared with solvent control. Occupancy of H3K4me2 on human CYP3A4 promoter (−362 to +53) and enhancer segment (−7 836 to −6 093) harbored the overlapping hepatocyte nuclear factors 4A (HNF4A) binding site compared with a negative control. Occupancy of H3K4me2 on human CYP3A7 promoter (−163 to +103) and enhancer segment (−4 054 to −3 421, −6 265 to −6 247) overlapped with glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding site. In conclusion, the enriched H3K4me2 in the promoter and enhancer regions was induced by pargyline with HNF4A or GR binding site in CYP3A4/3A7 gene to activate the corresponding genes.",Yao Xue Xue Bao,2017,"['He H', 'Wang P', 'Li SG', 'Chen YL', 'Kan QC', 'Zhang LR']"
29604899,Histone Acetyltransferases in Cancer: Guardians or Hazards?,"Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) catalyzing N-epsilon-lysine or N-alpha-terminal acetylation on histone and non-histone substrates are important epigenetic regulators controlling gene expression and chromatin structure. Deregulation of these enzymes by genetic or epigenetic alterations accompanied by defects in gene transcription have been implicated in oncogenesis. Therefore, these enzymes are considered promising therapeutic targets, offering new horizons for epigenetic cancer therapy. However, recent observations suggest that these enzymes function as both oncogenes and tumor suppressors. In this review, we present the current evidence demonstrating that individual HATs can either prevent cancer cell proliferation or drive malignant transformation depending on the molecular context and cancer type. We therefore advocate that future therapeutic interventions targeted toward these enzymes should carefully consider the fact that HATs commonly have a two-sided role in carcinogenesis.",Crit Rev Oncog,2017,"['Demetriadou C', 'Kirmizis A']"
28038453,Histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA mediates mast cell death and epigenetic silencing of constitutively active D816V KIT in systemic mastocytosis.,"Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a clonal bone marrow disorder, where therapeutical options are limited. Over 90% of the patients carry the D816V point mutation in the KIT receptor that renders this receptor constitutively active. We assessed the sensitivity of primary mast cells (MC) and mast cell lines HMC1.2 (D816V mutated), ROSA (KIT WT) and ROSA (KIT D816V) cells to histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) treatment. We found that of four HDACi, suberoyl anilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) was the most effective in killing mutated MC. SAHA downregulated KIT, followed by major MC apoptosis. Primary SM patient MC cultured ex vivo were even more sensitive to SAHA than HMC1.2 cells, whereas primary MC from healthy subjects were less affected. There was a correlation between cell death and SM disease severity, where cell death was more pronounced in the case of aggressive SM, with almost 100% cell death among MC from the mast cell leukemia patient. Additionally, ROSA (KIT D816V) was more affected by HDACi than ROSA (KIT WT) cells. Using ChIP qPCR, we found that the level of active chromatin mark H3K18ac/H3 decreased significantly in the KIT region. This epigenetic silencing was seen only in the KIT region and not in control genes upstream and downstream of KIT, indicating that the downregulation of KIT is exerted by specific epigenetic silencing. In conclusion, KIT D816V mutation sensitized MC to HDACi mediated killing, and SAHA may be of value as specific treatment for SM, although the specific mechanism of action requires further investigation.",Oncotarget,2017,"['Lyberg K', 'Ali HA', 'Grootens J', 'Kjellander M', 'Tirfing M', 'Arock M', 'Hägglund H', 'Nilsson G', 'Ungerstedt J']"
28030795,"AML associated oncofusion proteins PML-RARA, AML1-ETO and CBFB-MYH11 target RUNX/ETS-factor binding sites to modulate H3ac levels and drive leukemogenesis.","Chromosomal translocations are one of the hallmarks of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), often leading to gene fusions and expression of an oncofusion protein. Over recent years it has become clear that most of the AML associated oncofusion proteins molecularly adopt distinct mechanisms for inducing leukemogenesis. Still these unique molecular properties of the chimeric proteins converge and give rise to a common pathogenic molecular mechanism. In the present study we compared genome-wide DNA binding and transcriptome data associated with AML1-ETO, CBFB-MYH11 and PML-RARA oncofusion protein expression to identify unique and common features. Our analyses revealed targeting of oncofusion binding sites to RUNX1 and ETS-factor occupied genomic regions. In addition, it revealed a highly comparable global histone acetylation pattern, similar expression of common target genes and related enrichment of several biological pathways critical for maintenance of AML, suggesting oncofusion proteins deregulate common gene programs despite their distinct binding signatures and mechanisms of action.",Oncotarget,2017,"['Singh AA', 'Mandoli A', 'Prange KH', 'Laakso M', 'Martens JH']"
28024297,Variable chromatin structure revealed by in situ spatially correlated DNA cleavage mapping.,"Chromatin structure at the length scale encompassing local nucleosome-nucleosome interactions is thought to play a crucial role in regulating transcription and access to DNA. However, this secondary structure of chromatin remains poorly understood compared with the primary structure of single nucleosomes or the tertiary structure of long-range looping interactions. Here we report the first genome-wide map of chromatin conformation in human cells at the 1-3 nucleosome (50-500 bp) scale, obtained using ionizing radiation-induced spatially correlated cleavage of DNA with sequencing (RICC-seq) to identify DNA-DNA contacts that are spatially proximal. Unbiased analysis of RICC-seq signal reveals regional enrichment of DNA fragments characteristic of alternating rather than adjacent nucleosome interactions in tri-nucleosome units, particularly in H3K9me3-marked heterochromatin. We infer differences in the likelihood of nucleosome-nucleosome contacts among open chromatin, H3K27me3-marked, and H3K9me3-marked repressed chromatin regions. After calibrating RICC-seq signal to three-dimensional distances, we show that compact two-start helical fibre structures with stacked alternating nucleosomes are consistent with RICC-seq fragmentation patterns from H3K9me3-marked chromatin, while non-compact structures and solenoid structures are consistent with open chromatin. Our data support a model of chromatin architecture in intact interphase nuclei consistent with variable longitudinal compaction of two-start helical fibres.",Nature,2017,"['Risca VI', 'Denny SK', 'Straight AF', 'Greenleaf WJ']"
28018145,Epigenetics of Renal Development and Disease.,"An understanding of epigenetics is indispensable to our understanding of gene regulation under normal and pathological states. This knowledge will help with designing better therapeutic approaches in regenerative tissue medicine. Epigenetics allows us to parse out the mechanisms by which transcriptional regulators gain access to specific gene loci thereby imprinting epigenetic information affecting chromatin function. This epigenetic memory forms the basis of cell lineage specification in multicellular organisms. Post-translational modifications to DNA and histones in the nucleosome core form characteristic epigenetic codes which are distinct for self-renewing and primed progenitor cell populations. Studies of chromatin modifiers and modifications in renal development and disease have been gaining momentum. Both congenital and adult renal diseases have a gene-environment component, which involves alterations to the epigenetic information imprinted during development. This epigenetic memory must be characterized to establish optimal treatment of both acute and chronic renal diseases.",Yale J Biol Med,2016,"['Hilliard SA', 'El-Dahr SS']"
28018144,Deciphering the Epigenetic Code in Embryonic and Dental Pulp Stem Cells.,"A close cooperation between chromatin states, transcriptional modulation, and epigenetic modifications is required for establishing appropriate regulatory circuits underlying self-renewal and differentiation of adult and embryonic stem cells. A growing body of research has established that the epigenome topology provides a structural framework for engaging genes in the non-random chromosomal interactions to orchestrate complex processes such as cell-matrix interactions, cell adhesion and cell migration during lineage commitment. Over the past few years, the functional dissection of the epigenetic landscape has become increasingly important for understanding gene expression dynamics in stem cells naturally found in most tissues. Adult stem cells of the human dental pulp hold great promise for tissue engineering, particularly in the skeletal and tooth regenerative medicine. It is therefore likely that progress towards pulp regeneration will have a substantial impact on the clinical research. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge regarding epigenetic cues that have evolved to regulate the pluripotent differentiation potential of embryonic stem cells and the lineage determination of developing dental pulp progenitors.",Yale J Biol Med,2016,['Bayarsaihan D']
28013212,Editor's Highlight: Organ-Specific Epigenetic Changes Induced by the Nongenotoxic Liver Carcinogen Methapyrilene in Fischer 344 Rats.,"Continuous lifetime exposure to certain natural and man-made chemicals is a major cause of cancers in humans; therefore, evaluating the carcinogenic risks of chemicals remains important. Currently, substantial progress has been made in identification of genotoxic carcinogens; in contrast, predicting the carcinogenic potential of nongenotoxic compounds is a challenge due to many different modes of action that may lead to tumorigenesis. In the present study, we investigated the effects of the nongenotoxic liver carcinogen methapyrilene and the nongenotoxic noncarcinogen usnic acid, at doses that do not exhibit organ cytotoxicity, on epigenomic alterations in the livers and kidneys of Fischer 344 (F344) rats. We demonstrate that a repeat-dose oral treatment of male F344 rats with methapyrilene for 6 weeks caused target organ-specific epigenetic alterations in the livers. In contrast, only very slight epigenetic changes were found in the livers of F344 rats treated with hepatotoxicant, but noncarcinogen, usnic acid. The methapyrilene-induced epigenetic changes consisted of changes in histone lysine acetylation and methylation, with the greatest increase occurring in global and gene-specific histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) deacetylation. Importantly, the results of the present study show an association between gene-specific histone H3K9 deacetylation and a reduced expression of critical cancer-related genes, including prospero homeobox 1 (Prox1), HNF1 homebox A (Hnf1a), and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (Ppara), which provides a mechanistic link between methapyrilene-induced epigenetic aberrations and liver carcinogenesis.",Toxicol.

28011149,"Chromatin associated mechanisms in base excision repair - nucleosome remodeling and DNA transcription, two key players.","Genomic DNA is prone to a large number of insults by a myriad of endogenous and exogenous agents. The base excision repair (BER) is the major mechanism used by cells for the removal of various DNA lesions spontaneously or environmentally induced and the maintenance of genome integrity. The presence of persistent DNA damage is not compatible with life, since abrogation of BER leads to early embryonic lethality in mice. There are several lines of evidences showing existence of a link between deficient BER, cancer proneness and ageing, thus illustrating the importance of this DNA repair pathway in human health. Although the enzymology of BER mechanisms has been largely elucidated using chemically defined DNA damage substrates and purified proteins, the complex interplay of BER with another vital process like transcription or when DNA is in its natural state (i.e. wrapped in nucleosome and assembled in chromatin fiber is largely unexplored. Cells use chromatin remodeling factors to overcome the general repression associated with the nucleosomal organization. It is broadly accepted that energy-dependent nucleosome remodeling factors disrupt histones-DNA interactions at the expense of ATP hydrolysis to favor transcription as well as DNA repair. Importantly, unlike transcription, BER is not part of a regulated developmental process but represents a maintenance system that should be efficient anytime and anywhere in the genome. In this review we will discuss how BER can deal with chromatin organization to maintain genetic information. Emphasis will be placed on the following challenging question: how BER is initiated within chromatin?",Free Radic. Biol. Med.,2017,"['Menoni H', 'Di Mascio P', 'Cadet J', 'Dimitrov S', 'Angelov D']"
